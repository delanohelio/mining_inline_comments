This updated the proto version and was mostly an additive change that included adding the new registration methods required for creating the Go gRPC service.\n\nVerifying this change\n\nUnable to test changes because Go tests were already failing. Currently investigating.\nMore testing will be done in subsequent commits because the Go gRPC functionality is not yet complete.

Updated all references.
