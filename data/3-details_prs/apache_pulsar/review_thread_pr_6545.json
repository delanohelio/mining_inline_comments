While companies have tried to leverage monolithic messaging\n+systems to build-out real-time offerings, they\u2019ve hit major roadblocks. Ultimately, these\n+technologies are not equipped to provide the scale or reliability that mission-critical\n+applications require.\n+\n+As a result, companies have sought-out Apache Pulsar for its cloud-native, distributed\n+messaging and streaming platform capabilities. From asynchronous applications to core\n+business applications to ETL, companies are increasingly leveraging Pulsar to develop\n+real-time applications.\n+\n+Pulsar has received global adoption from major technology companies such as Verizon Media,\n+Narvar, Overstock, Nutanix, Yahoo! JAPAN, Tencent, OVHCloud, and Clever Cloud, who rely on\n+its ability to deliver on performance, scalability, and resiliency. As the Pulsar project\n+and community garner increasing attention, we\u2019re excited to share the **2020 Apache Pulsar User Survey Report**.\n+\n+![](../img/pulsar-adoption.png)\n+\n+In the 2020 Apache Pulsar User Survey Report, we hear from 165 users and learn how their\n+companies are leveraging Pulsar\u2019s cloud-native, multi-layer design architecture, built-in\n+multi-tenancy, and multi-cluster replication, to build scalable real-time offerings. This\n+report details insights and use cases on how organizations are deploying Pulsar today.\n+\n+The report also reveals Pulsar\u2019s top-used features, its most popular applications, and how\n+it is delivering scalable, reliable, real-time streaming solutions for organizations. In\n+this quotation from Qiang Fei, Tech Lead for Tencent, we see how\n+[one organization is leveraging Pulsar to improve their offering](https://streamnative.io/whitepaper/case-studay-apache-pulsar-tencent-billing/):\n+\n+> Pulsar provides us with a highly consistent and highly reliable distributed message queue that\n+> fits well in our financial use cases. Multi-tenant and storage separation architecture design\n+> greatly reduces our operational and maintenance overhead. We have used Pulsar on a very large\n+> scale in our organization and we are impressed that Pulsar is able to provide high consistency\n+> while supporting high concurrent client connections.\n+> \n+> - Qiang Fei, Tech Lead at Tencent\n+\n+From its built-in multi-tenancy, which reduces architectural complexity and enables organizations\n+to scale, to its multi-datacenter replication, which allows Pulsar to handle datacenter failures,", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "fee0ca49ff09f5d9f062931c3f9205ee9e253344"}, "originalPosition": 49}]}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 1944, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-11T21:28:48Z"}}}
