The getDurableSubscription updates the subscriptions map concurrently as well. I believe this opens us up to a race under the following conditions:\n\nWe call get for a subscription on line 695, and get null.\nThen, a durable subscription with the same name is added to the subscriptions map on line 665.\nThen, the non durable subscription is put into the subscriptions map on new line 722, and in doing so, overwrites the durable subscription of the same name.\n\nDo you agree this is a risk here? If so, I will work on contributing a fix. I wanted to check first though, just in case there is context I'm missing.
