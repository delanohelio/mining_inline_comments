The voting period should remain open for at least 2 weeks. Each Maintainer gets one\n+vote and the majority will decide the direction. The final decision including the rational for the majority decision\n+must be summarized by a maintainer.\n+\n+== Maintainers\n+The ServiceTalk Maintainers are responsible for the long term maintenance of the ServiceTalk project/organization. Any\n+additions to the repository are weighted on a spectrum of applicability and maintenance overhead. If a feature lies on\n+the limited applicability and high maintenance end of the spectrum the maintainers tend to decide against expanding\n+scope of the repository. In the future the maintainers may create a separate organization to facilitate discovery and\n+collaboration for community projects. Until this time contributions can be maintained outside the ServiceTalk\n+project, demonstrate maturity/adoption, and then be considered for contribution back to the ServiceTalk organization.\n+\n+=== Become a Maintainer\n+Making contributions does not require becoming a maintainer, or obtaining commit access to the ServiceTalk\n+project/organization. However if you are interested in taking a more formal role with decision making power you should\n+consider becoming a Maintainer. Some characteristics of a Maintainer are as follows:\n+\n+* Be involved in contributing code, pull request review, triage of issues and addressing user questions in one or more\n+forums such as Github, Stackoverflow, etc.\n+* Maintain sustained contribution to the ServiceTalk project and spend a reasonable amount of time on it.\n+* Show deep understanding of the areas contributed to, and good consideration of various reliability, usability,\n+backward compatibility, and performance requirements.\n+\n+If you believe you satisfy these above criteria please open a\n+link:https://github.com/apple/servicetalk/compare[github pull request] modifying the\n+xref:MAINTAINERS.adoc[Maintainers doc] describing at least 5 non-trivial pull requests that have\n+been accepted without major modifications. Please also make your case as to why you feel you will need Maintainer status\n+moving forward and intention of continued involvement. Existing Maintainers must vote on the PR and a majority vote is\n+required to merge and add the new Maintainer (see <<Decision Making and Voting>>).\n+\n+=== Expectations of a Maintainer\n+After becoming a Maintainer you have the following expectations:\n+\n+* You are granted commit-after-approval to all parts of ServiceTalk.\n+* You may commit an obvious change without first getting approval. The community expects you to use good judgment.\n+Examples are reverting obviously broken patches, correcting code comments, and other minor changes.\n+* You are allowed to commit changes without approval to the portions of ServiceTalk to which you have contributed or\n+for which you have been assigned responsibility. Such commits must not break the build and follow backward compatibility\n+requirements. This is a \u201ctrust but verify\u201d policy, and commits of this nature are reviewed after being committed.\n+\n+Even with commit access, your changes are still subject to code review. Of course, you are also encouraged to review\n+other peoples\u2019 changes.\n+\n+=== Losing Maintainer Status\n+If a maintainer is no longer interested or cannot perform the maintainer duties listed above, they should volunteer to\n+be moved to emeritus status. If possible, try to complete your work or help find someone to pick up your work before\n+stepping down. If a maintainer has stopped contributing for a reasonable amount of time, other maintainers may propose\n+to move such maintainers to emeritus list without prior notice. The PR for a such as change would serve as the notice.\n+Such a PR should have @mention of the maintainer in question and should remain open for at least a period of two weeks.\n+Any disagreements will be resolved by a vote of the maintainers per the voting process above.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQxNjU2NDMwMA=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "e319c1b944f8306b78d15c624f1c047e69797a2b"}, "originalPosition": 65}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMjU5MjU2MzIzOnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "GOVERNANCE.adoc", "isResolved": false, "comments": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNC0yOFQxNToxNzo1OFrOGNZURA==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNC0yOFQxNTozNToyNFrOGNaK3Q==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQxNjY5OTQ2MA==", "bodyText": "nit: I think its pull-requests", "url": "https://github.com/apple/servicetalk/pull/1031#discussion_r416699460", "createdAt": "2020-04-28T15:17:58Z", "author": {"login": "normanmaurer"}, "path": "GOVERNANCE.adoc", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,70 @@\n+This document describes the governance rules of the ServiceTalk organization.
