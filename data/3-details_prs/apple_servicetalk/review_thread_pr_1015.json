The concurrency is introduced by this class, error recovery can be encapsulated in the class, and IMHO the simplification on control flow to remove error handling is not worth the potential complexity to debug later. The control flow is also different between request and cancel so it isn't necessarily the case that an exception/bug in request means cancel also has a bug.
