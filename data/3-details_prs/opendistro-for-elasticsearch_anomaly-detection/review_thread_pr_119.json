You can also view the anomaly history for all of your created detectors. \n+\n+You can use the plugin with the same version of the [Open Distro Alerting plugin](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/alerting) and [Open Distro Alerting Kibana plugin](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/alerting-kibana-plugin) to get alert notifications. You can create a monitor based on an anomaly detector directly on the Alerting Kibana plugin. Monitors run checks on the anomaly detection results regularly and trigger alerts based on custom trigger conditions.\n+\n+## Features\n+\n+1. Create and configure anomaly detectors over user-specified indices and features\n+2. Start and stop detectors at any time\n+3. Query anomaly results\n+4. Query existing detectors\n+5.
