For this purpose will be used kafka message\n+header with run-id encoded in it. Run id should be unique within a single deployment.\n+Each component will emit messages with run-id header that is valid by the deployment. All receiver parts\n+should validate message header first and verify that run id matches with its configuration in that case component\n+will handle the message. Kafka provides API to write custom interceptors for both consumer and producer. This\n+interceptor will be responsible for verifying deployment id.\n+\n+### Zookeeper to store the state\n+\n+Since storm has limitations on lifecycle of its topologies, new mechanism is required to deal with topologies states. \n+Also it should be responsible to handle graceful shutdown procedure for topologies. For this role Apache Zookeeper\n+looks like a good fit.\n+\n+#### Node structure for Zookeeper\n+\n+`/kilda/{component_type}/{env_id}` - root for every component process, where:\n+`component_type` - topology or service name, e.g. `floodlight`, `network`, `nb_worker`\n+`env_id` - flag of blue or green env\n+\n+#### Signal, States and Build-Version\n+\n+Each component root node will have 3 children zNodes:\n+- signal - input field, can be `START` or `SHUTDOWN`, the way to make component start emittin processing new events\n+- state - int, number of active subcomponents of a component, when `SHUTDOWN` is emitted, should be `0`, positive otherwise.\n+- build-version - string field with run id, could be changed on fly, see #Shared transport for details\n+For the long running task such as hub in hub and spoke topologies, there should be a way to stop receiving new\n+requests, finishing up existing, and after that decrementing counter by 1 in a state field.\n+\n+#### Basic Deployment Scenario:\n+\n+*Note*\n+For this upgrade procedure each switch should be connected to 2 floodlights simultaneously.\n+ \n+Since floodlights could be distinguished by region let's assume, that all odd regions are green and even are blue\n+For the scenario, below suppose that `blue` is a current env and `green` is the one to be deployed.\n+Based on that the process should look like:\n+\n+- Ensure that `signal` for the `green` components is set to `SHUTDOWN` and the `build-version` is updated  \n+- Deploy green topologies  \n+- Set `SHUTDOWN` signal for `green` floodlights \n+- Redeploy floodlight containers of `green` color\n+- Redeploy grpc containers of `green` color", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "dbfa24f5f305d3fa7124b7ede971e5de8deba87b"}, "originalPosition": 59}]}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 2348, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-13T14:23:39Z"}}}
