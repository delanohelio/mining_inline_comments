This is a collection that can be set on an entity that will redirect all the ItemEntitys it would otherwise drop on the ground into said collection.\nThe second part (in the second commit) adds to LivingEntity to use this mechanism to catch all the items the LivingEntity drops when it dies, and pass it through an event to let mods alter the dropped items. Finally it spawns them if the event wasn't cancelled.\nNote that the second part creates a dependency from patchwork-events-entity to patchwork-extensions, however it seemed like the most logical place to put both parts.\nThe second part does involve some hackery to access the looting level after the local variable has been dropped, passing it through a field (described in a JavaDoc comment). I could just call EnchantmentHelper.getLooting again, but we'd have to use this method anyway when we implement LootingLevelEvent.", "createdAt": "2020-06-21T03:39:03Z", "url": "https://github.com/PatchworkMC/patchwork-api/pull/96", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "929bf8d02c6071779472724ab574c4ebd4325973"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-06-23T02:13:50Z", "author": {"login": "ZNixian"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 9, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABctGGphAH2gAyNDM3NDkwNjEzOjNhMTZkOWE4YzAyNzk2NzRhZjQ3NTc1MzFhMzlkZWE3YjUxMWE2ZWI=", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABct7zkaAFqTQzNTM5MjM1MA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "3a16d9a8c0279674af4757531a39dea7b511a6eb", "author": {"user": {"login": "ZNixian", "name": "Campbell Suter"}}, "url": "https://github.com/PatchworkMC/patchwork-api/commit/3a16d9a8c0279674af4757531a39dea7b511a6eb", "committedDate": "2020-06-20T11:39:22Z", "message": "Add the IForgeEntity/Entity method captureDrops, and implement entity drop capturing"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "5b1385cc35ac79aff56e6770b57e958f69013768", "author": {"user": {"login": "ZNixian", "name": "Campbell Suter"}}, "url": "https://github.com/PatchworkMC/patchwork-api/commit/5b1385cc35ac79aff56e6770b57e958f69013768", "committedDate": "2020-06-21T03:23:52Z", "message": "Add LivingDropsEvent"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDM0NDY3Mjcz", "url": "https://github.com/PatchworkMC/patchwork-api/pull/96#pullrequestreview-434467273", "createdAt": "2020-06-21T03:42:51Z", "commit": {"oid": "5b1385cc35ac79aff56e6770b57e958f69013768"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNi0yMVQwMzo0Mjo1MlrOGmpdwA==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNi0yMVQwMzo0Mjo1MlrOGmpdwA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0MzE3ODQzMg==", "bodyText": "Thank you for the descriptive javadoc!", "url": "https://github.com/PatchworkMC/patchwork-api/pull/96#discussion_r443178432", "createdAt": "2020-06-21T03:42:52Z", "author": {"login": "TheGlitch76"}, "path": "patchwork-events-entity/src/main/java/net/patchworkmc/mixin/event/entity/MixinLivingEntity.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -101,6 +115,65 @@ private void hookHandleFallDamageCancel(float distance, float damageMultiplier,\n \t\t}\n \t}\n \n+\t/**\n+\t * Carry over the looting level between the two mixins for the drop method.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "5b1385cc35ac79aff56e6770b57e958f69013768"}, "originalPosition": 41}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDM0NTIyOTE0", "url": "https://github.com/PatchworkMC/patchwork-api/pull/96#pullrequestreview-434522914", "createdAt": "2020-06-21T18:34:06Z", "commit": {"oid": "5b1385cc35ac79aff56e6770b57e958f69013768"}, "state": "CHANGES_REQUESTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNi0yMVQxODo0NjoyM1rOGmtlew==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNi0yMVQxODo0ODo1N1rOGmtmZg==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0MzI0NTk0Nw==", "bodyText": "Forge javadoc once again proves to be awful.
