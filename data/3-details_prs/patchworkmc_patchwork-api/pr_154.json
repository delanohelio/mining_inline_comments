The two additions in question are conflict handling and modifier key support. Because forge uses the default KeyBinding methods for this behavior this shouldn't cause any issues. I can make a follow up PR to add the complete API but these methods are not commonly used to begin with and I suspect this might be all that is needed. Additionally this method allows fabric mods that add these functions to support Patchwork mods.\nI'm not sure about Patchwork naming conventions so better names are welcome.\nThis requires a Patcher PR, namely PatchworkMC/patchwork-patcher#67.", "createdAt": "2020-07-27T03:48:15Z", "url": "https://github.com/PatchworkMC/patchwork-api/pull/154", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "5cb31ac45f03df5ae24cfcaa0e87c6dbe58cb74f"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-07-30T00:16:18Z", "author": {"login": "Snakefangox"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 15, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABc4nUzuAH2gAyNDU2ODgwMDk2OmI2YzhhZGIyZDBiMjJiODU2NGFlNjg0NGU4M2E3NWM2M2JlZjFhYjI=", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABc5z-OAgH2gAyNDU2ODgwMDk2OmVlMTgzOWI5MTI0NDg3ZDExYmUyOWVlZDE1YmUyODFlM2Q2NzI5ZTM=", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "b6c8adb2d0b22b8564ae6844e83a75c63bef1ab2", "author": {"user": {"login": "Snakefangox", "name": "Snakefangox"}}, "url": "https://github.com/PatchworkMC/patchwork-api/commit/b6c8adb2d0b22b8564ae6844e83a75c63bef1ab2", "committedDate": "2020-07-26T06:34:52Z", "message": "Added patchwork-key-bindings"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "0a5df0afe9266e535386119bdd68ecb326991d1f", "author": {"user": {"login": "Snakefangox", "name": "Snakefangox"}}, "url": "https://github.com/PatchworkMC/patchwork-api/commit/0a5df0afe9266e535386119bdd68ecb326991d1f", "committedDate": "2020-07-27T02:36:27Z", "message": "Added patchwork keybinding for Patcher\n\n\nCleaning up remaining absolute imports"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "9b11366367cc7cbc0bc96713d89499c21437d46c", "author": {"user": {"login": "Snakefangox", "name": "Snakefangox"}}, "url": "https://github.com/PatchworkMC/patchwork-api/commit/9b11366367cc7cbc0bc96713d89499c21437d46c", "committedDate": "2020-07-27T02:44:17Z", "message": "Add Patchwork-Keybindings"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "19f3f4c0e60a981d61e533bdc296972801f8f7ff", "author": {"user": {"login": "Snakefangox", "name": "Snakefangox"}}, "url": "https://github.com/PatchworkMC/patchwork-api/commit/19f3f4c0e60a981d61e533bdc296972801f8f7ff", "committedDate": "2020-07-27T04:06:01Z", "message": "Fix missing import"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDU1NTI1MTcy", "url": "https://github.com/PatchworkMC/patchwork-api/pull/154#pullrequestreview-455525172", "createdAt": "2020-07-27T07:15:43Z", "commit": {"oid": "19f3f4c0e60a981d61e533bdc296972801f8f7ff"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNy0yN1QwNzoxNTo0M1rOG3WTjw==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNy0yN1QwNzoxNTo0M1rOG3WTjw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2MDY5MDMxOQ==", "bodyText": "patchwork-key-bindings", "url": "https://github.com/PatchworkMC/patchwork-api/pull/154#discussion_r460690319", "createdAt": "2020-07-27T07:15:43Z", "author": {"login": "Rongmario"}, "path": "patchwork-key-bindings/build.gradle", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,2 @@\n+archivesBaseName = \"patchwork-gui\"", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "19f3f4c0e60a981d61e533bdc296972801f8f7ff"}, "originalPosition": 1}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "3a5448e314b4937cfa2998e4f0183988e80fa0a3", "author": {"user": {"login": "Snakefangox", "name": "Snakefangox"}}, "url": "https://github.com/PatchworkMC/patchwork-api/commit/3a5448e314b4937cfa2998e4f0183988e80fa0a3", "committedDate": "2020-07-27T07:30:46Z", "message": "Fix archive base name"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDU1NzM5Mjk4", "url": "https://github.com/PatchworkMC/patchwork-api/pull/154#pullrequestreview-455739298", "createdAt": "2020-07-27T12:37:26Z", "commit": {"oid": "3a5448e314b4937cfa2998e4f0183988e80fa0a3"}, "state": "CHANGES_REQUESTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 3, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNy0yN1QxMjozNzoyN1rOG3gktA==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNy0yN1QxMjozODoyNlrOG3gm2g==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2MDg1ODU0OA==", "bodyText": "Is there any reason this doesn't match the casing of KeyBinding?", "url": "https://github.com/PatchworkMC/patchwork-api/pull/154#discussion_r460858548", "createdAt": "2020-07-27T12:37:27Z", "author": {"login": "famous1622"}, "path": "patchwork-key-bindings/src/main/java/net/patchworkmc/mixin/keybindings/MixinKeybinding.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,88 @@\n+/*\n+ * Minecraft Forge, Patchwork Project\n+ * Copyright (c) 2016-2020, 2019-2020\n+ *\n+ * This library is free software;
