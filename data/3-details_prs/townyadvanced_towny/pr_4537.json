Usages have been forwarded to new classes.\n\n\n\nCreates a WarPreUnclaimEvent TownPreUnclaimCmdEvent (TPUCE) in the war.common.events event.town package.\n\n\nIntroduces a new language key, used by the events for default cancelation messages.\n\n\nCreates a listener for Flag War that implements the TPUCE event.\n\nName's not important, it may be renamed post-split, or merged with an existing Flag War listener. Implementation in this PR is for proof-of-concept.\n\n\n\n\nOutstanding Tasks To-Do\n\n\n Test against the new event with the TownyCommonListener\n\nStill need to test, I've got my test bench strewn across a desk at the moment.\n\nRequires configuration to match the following for testing:\n\nFlagWar: WAR_ENEMY_PREVENT_INTERACTION_WHILE_FLAGGED [true]\nFlagWar: WAR_ENEMY_TIME_TO_WAIT_AFTER_FLAGGED [int; any reasonable value]\n\n\n\n\nNeed to probably test in offline mode, or outsource testing to a towny junkie prerelease tester.\n\n\n\n Push a commit with additional Javadoc for the WarPreUnclaimEvent TownPreUnclaimCmdEvent.\n\n\n Add language key to other language files.\n\n\n Update [VERSION] in deprecation annotations; Bump lang-file version if necessary.\n\nUpdate either prior to merge, once it's decided if it'll make it in - or LlmDl can update post merge.\n\n\n\n\nNew Nodes/Commands/ConfigOptions:\n\nEvents:\n\nModified: TUE and TPUE relocated; added cancelMessage to TPUE\nNew: Cancellable TPUCE created in event.town package, fired after the /t unclaim [args] command is received before any major unclaiming processing is done.\n\nLanguage:\n\nAdded new key to english.yml: msg_err_town_unclaim_canceled\n\n\nRelevant Towny Issue ticket:\n\n#4514 Doesn't solve it as originally intended, but gets the job done.\n#4511 Allows for tracking PR to be updated and other necessary changes to be reevaluated.\n\n\n I have tested this pull request for defects on a server.\n\n\nBy making this pull request, I represent that I have the right to waive copyright and related rights to my contribution, and agree that all copyright and related rights in my contributions are waived, and I acknowledge that the TownyAdvanced organization has the copyright to use and modify my contribution under the Towny License for perpetuity.", "createdAt": "2020-12-07T09:56:24Z", "url": "https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny/pull/4537", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "f84771661b700cd3cc7876fde79de629ec3e3927"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-12-11T19:00:18Z", "author": {"login": "TheFlagCourier"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 17, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABdj18XGgFqTU0NjE2ODI0Mw==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABdk8UY6gFqTU0OTcwNDQ3Nw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NTQ2MTY4MjQz", "url": "https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny/pull/4537#pullrequestreview-546168243", "createdAt": "2020-12-07T13:55:28Z", "commit": {"oid": "39f0c93c3e8afd4c92a18e10a213b7e431b2eebf"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMi0wN1QxMzo1NToyOVrOIAn1tQ==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMi0wN1QxMzo1NToyOVrOIAn1tQ==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUzNzUyMzYzNw==", "bodyText": "On a previous change (maybe neutrality toggling) I put in returns after the event.setCancelled(true), just in case this first statement and the following statement were both true, the 2nd cancellation message would override the first.", "url": "https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny/pull/4537#discussion_r537523637", "createdAt": "2020-12-07T13:55:29Z", "author": {"login": "LlmDl"}, "path": "src/com/palmergames/bukkit/towny/war/flagwar/listeners/TownyCommonListener.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,29 @@\n+package com.palmergames.bukkit.towny.war.flagwar.listeners;\r\n+\r\n+import com.palmergames.bukkit.towny.TownySettings;\r\n+import com.palmergames.bukkit.towny.object.Translation;\r\n+import com.palmergames.bukkit.towny.war.common.events.WarPreUnclaimEvent;\r\n+import com.palmergames.bukkit.towny.war.flagwar.FlagWar;\r\n+import org.bukkit.event.EventHandler;\r\n+import org.bukkit.event.EventPriority;\r\n+import org.bukkit.event.Listener;\r\n+\r\n+/**\r\n+ * Listener for processing events from Towny's Common War Events.\r\n+ */\r\n+public class TownyCommonListener implements Listener {\r\n+\r\n+  @EventHandler (priority= EventPriority.HIGH)\r\n+  private void onWarPreUnclaim(WarPreUnclaimEvent event) {\r\n+    if (FlagWar.isUnderAttack(event.getTown()) && TownySettings.isFlaggedInteractionTown()) {\r\n+      event.setCancelMessage(Translation.of(\"msg_war_flag_deny_town_under_attack\"));\r\n+      event.setCancelled(true);\r", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "39f0c93c3e8afd4c92a18e10a213b7e431b2eebf"}, "originalPosition": 20}]}}, {"__typename": "HeadRefForcePushedEvent", "beforeCommit": {"oid": "ad304d617e1dde33c7626487473b2c0523bba247", "author": {"user": {"login": "TheFlagCourier", "name": "FlagCourier"}}, "url": "https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny/commit/ad304d617e1dde33c7626487473b2c0523bba247", "committedDate": "2020-12-07T18:55:14Z", "message": "Add a breaking return to TownyCommonListener\n\nPrevent second if from overwriting the first's message."}, "afterCommit": {"oid": "612cd487e53a1e7da215e5008429e89b0eaaf316", "author": {"user": {"login": "TheFlagCourier", "name": "FlagCourier"}}, "url": "https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny/commit/612cd487e53a1e7da215e5008429e89b0eaaf316", "committedDate": "2020-12-09T00:44:51Z", "message": "Re-pkg WarPreUnclaimEvent as TownPreUnclaimCmdEvent in `event.town` pkg.\n\nMakes a bit more sense, when you think about it.
