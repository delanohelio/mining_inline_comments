This is an indicator we can just go without, without having to go through the plugin detachment dance.\n\nScreenshots of agents created in 2.1 and 2.2\nAgent created on 2.1\n\nAgent created on 2.2\n\n\nUntested.\nProposed changelog entries\n\nRFE: Do not longer record the user creating an agent in some circumstances.\n\nProposed upgrade guidelines\nN/A\nSubmitter checklist\n\n JIRA issue is well described\n Changelog entries and upgrade guidelines are appropriate for the audience affected by the change (users or developer, depending on the change). Examples\n\nFill-in the Proposed changelog entries section only if there are breaking changes or other changes which may require extra steps from users during the upgrade\n\n\n[n/a] Appropriate autotests or explanation to why this change has no tests\n[n/a] For dependency updates: links to external changelogs and, if possible, full diffs\n\nDesired reviewers\nN/A\nMaintainer checklist\nBefore the changes are marked as ready-for-merge:\n\n There are at least 2 approvals for the pull request and no outstanding requests for change\n Conversations in the pull request are over OR it is explicit that a reviewer does not block the change\n Changelog entries in the PR title and/or Proposed changelog entries are correct\n Proper changelog labels are set so that the changelog can be generated automatically\n (not applicable) If the change needs additional upgrade steps from users, upgrade-guide-needed label is set and there is a Proposed upgrade guidelines section in the PR title.
