The breakpoint is triggered, then, inside your favorite IDE, executing json = new net.sf.json.JSONObject(true) and let the rest of the code runs. This will throw a JSONException that will end display in that page.\nI can bet there are other ways to trigger this error, but I prefered to keep focus on the un-inline as I had a way to trigger the page.\nZFSInstaller\nUn-inline the JavaScript / CSS from ZFSInstaller/askRootPassword.jelly by re-using the showDetails.\nTo trigger this page, I put a breakpoint in ZFSInstaller.java#L237, then browse to http://localhost:8080/jenkins/administrativeMonitor/hudson.os.solaris.ZFSInstaller/start, confirm the POST, then the breakpoint is triggered, you can execute:\nreq.setAttribute(\"message\", \"testMessage\");\nrsp.forward(this,\"askRootPassword\",req);\n\nand let the rest of the code run.\nFor both cases, the showDetails was using a custom inlined JavaScript while the showDetails feature was already present in hudson-behavior.js. The impact is that we are moving from a button to a link.\nSee JENKINS-60866.\n\nScreenshots\nAbstractModelObject\n\nZFSInstaller\n\n\n\nProposed changelog entries\n\n(internal) Remove inline resources for non-standard showDetails\n\n\nProposed upgrade guidelines\nN/A\nSubmitter checklist\n\n (If applicable) Jira issue is well described\n Changelog entries and upgrade guidelines are appropriate for the audience affected by the change (users or developer, depending on the change). Examples\n\nFill-in the Proposed changelog entries section only if there are breaking changes or other changes which may require extra steps from users during the upgrade\n\n\n[n/a] Appropriate autotests or explanation to why this change has no tests\n[n/a] For dependency updates: links to external changelogs and, if possible, full diffs\n\n\nDesired reviewers\n@mention\n\nMaintainer checklist\nBefore the changes are marked as ready-for-merge:\n\n There are at least 2 approvals for the pull request and no outstanding requests for change\n Conversations in the pull request are over OR it is explicit that a reviewer does not block the change\n Changelog entries in the PR title and/or Proposed changelog entries are correct\n Proper changelog labels are set so that the changelog can be generated automatically\n If the change needs additional upgrade steps from users, upgrade-guide-needed label is set and there is a Proposed upgrade guidelines section in the PR title. (example)\n If it would make sense to backport the change to LTS, a Jira issue must exist, be a Bug or Improvement, and be labeled as lts-candidate to be considered (see query).", "createdAt": "2020-05-25T20:52:08Z", "url": "https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/4743", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "924b6865cec76241143cdd28e8a0e010c0e6e2b9"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-06-05T21:50:35Z", "author": {"login": "Wadeck"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 6, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABck1qKxgH2gAyNDIyODkzMjUzOjlhZDEwY2E1NmQ0ZTg1NTA0OWNhMDZmZGE3MTk1YzFkZTBiNWIyMWE=", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABcoEqG8AFqTQyNDgzNTc5MA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "9ad10ca56d4e855049ca06fda7195c1de0b5b21a", "author": {"user": {"login": "Wadeck", "name": "Wadeck Follonier"}}, "url": "https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/9ad10ca56d4e855049ca06fda7195c1de0b5b21a", "committedDate": "2020-05-25T19:58:23Z", "message": "[JENKINS-60866] Un-inline AbstractModelObject/error.jelly"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "baf4fab44c30d0e744cd2a9135ba7af432e441ab", "author": {"user": {"login": "Wadeck", "name": "Wadeck Follonier"}}, "url": "https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/baf4fab44c30d0e744cd2a9135ba7af432e441ab", "committedDate": "2020-05-25T20:46:12Z", "message": "[JENKINS-60866] Un-inline non-standard showDetails"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDE3ODcyODUx", "url": "https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/4743#pullrequestreview-417872851", "createdAt": "2020-05-25T20:52:53Z", "commit": {"oid": "baf4fab44c30d0e744cd2a9135ba7af432e441ab"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNS0yNVQyMDo1Mjo1NFrOGaJgag==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNS0yNVQyMDo1Mjo1NFrOGaJgag==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzMDA3MTkxNA==", "bodyText": "To not confuse with the new \"hidden-by-default\" used in PluginManager", "url": "https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/4743#discussion_r430071914", "createdAt": "2020-05-25T20:52:54Z", "author": {"login": "Wadeck"}, "path": "war/src/main/less/base/style.less", "diffHunk": "@@ -2000,5 +2000,10 @@ body.no-sticker #bottom-sticker {\n   height: 2em;\n }\n \n+/* used by elements that are hidden by default but revealed throught JavaScript */\n+.default-hidden {", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "baf4fab44c30d0e744cd2a9135ba7af432e441ab"}, "originalPosition": 5}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDE3ODcyOTE1", "url": "https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/4743#pullrequestreview-417872915", "createdAt": "2020-05-25T20:53:12Z", "commit": {"oid": "baf4fab44c30d0e744cd2a9135ba7af432e441ab"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNS0yNVQyMDo1MzoxMlrOGaJgsw==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNS0yNVQyMDo1MzoxMlrOGaJgsw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzMDA3MTk4Nw==", "bodyText": "The style was not applied in the final HTML generated", "url": "https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/4743#discussion_r430071987", "createdAt": "2020-05-25T20:53:12Z", "author": {"login": "Wadeck"}, "path": "core/src/main/resources/hudson/os/solaris/ZFSInstaller/askRootPassword.jelly", "diffHunk": "@@ -45,18 +45,13 @@ THE SOFTWARE.\n           </f:entry>\n \n           <f:block>\n-            <f:submit value=\"${%OK}\" style=\"margin-top:1em;\" />\n+            <f:submit value=\"${%OK}\" />", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "baf4fab44c30d0e744cd2a9135ba7af432e441ab"}, "originalPosition": 14}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDE4MDE4MDk5", "url": "https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/4743#pullrequestreview-418018099", "createdAt": "2020-05-26T06:59:24Z", "commit": {"oid": "baf4fab44c30d0e744cd2a9135ba7af432e441ab"}, "state": "APPROVED", "comments": {"totalCount": 0, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": null, "endCursor": null, "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": []}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDI0ODM1Nzkw", "url": "https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/4743#pullrequestreview-424835790", "createdAt": "2020-06-04T21:08:40Z", "commit": {"oid": "baf4fab44c30d0e744cd2a9135ba7af432e441ab"}, "state": "APPROVED", "comments": {"totalCount": 0, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": null, "endCursor": null, "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": []}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 2268, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-10-28T18:54:27Z"}}}
