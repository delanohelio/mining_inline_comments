objectives:\n+\n+* **Perform initial triage of an issue**.\n+  Issue triage team members are not expected to perform a full analysis of the issue (though they are welcome to do so!).\n+  The main goal is to ensure that an issue report is legitimate and that it contains enough information to be processed.\n+  It is fine to request additional information from submitters and/or to refer them to reporting guidelines:\n+** link:https://www.jenkins.io/participate/report-issue/[Guide: How to report an issue in Jenkins]\n+** link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting#reporting-issues[Reporting Jenkins Remoting issues]\n+* **Verify the issue component**.\n+  It is essential to ensure that the `component` field references the right component (the Jenkins core, a plugin, etc.)\n+  so that an issue can be discovered and processed by a component maintainer.\n+  When moving an issue, assign the issue to the `automatic` assignee so that the maintainer gets notification.\n+  Not all components have a default assignee, and it is perfectly fine to leave the assignee empty.\n+* **Verify the issue type**.\n+  `Bug` should be used for bug reports.\n+  All other issue types are considered as requests for enhancements, and there is no practical difference for the Jenkins core.\n+* **Verify the issue metadata**: Jenkins version, environment, labels, etc.\n+  Such metadata is useful for further triage and issue discoverability.\n+  There are some labels used in Jenkins Jira dashboard and filters, e.g. `jcasc-compatibility`, `java11-compatibility`, `jep-200`, etc.\n+  Assigning such labels helps users and maintainers to discover issues and act on them.\n+  There is no list of such \"common labels\" recommended for use.\n+  Some labels can be found in similar issues or documentation linked from system log entries in the reports.\n+* **Move security issue** to the `SECURITY` project.\n+  Sometimes the issue reporters do not follow the link:https://www.jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities[vulnerability reporting] process and report security issues in public.\n+  If you see such issues, move them to the `SECURITY` project so that the security team takes care of their triage.\n+* **Label regressions and CC stakeholders** if an issue is reported as a regression with a clear root cause,\n+  please set a `regression` label and, if applicable, CC contributors of a change which led to the regression.\n+* **Resolve invalid issues and support requests**.\n+  Sometimes Jenkins Jira is used as a support portal.\n+  We do not want to encourage that.\n+  Jenkins Jira is an issue tracker, and we expect reporters to investigate issues on their side to an extent that they can be reviewed by maintainers.\n+  For support requests users are expected to use link:https://www.jenkins.io/mailing-lists[mailing lists],\n+  link:https://www.jenkins.io/chat/[chats] and other resources (e.g. Stackoverflow).\n+  It is fine to link users to link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/.github/blob/master/SUPPORT.md[this page]. \n+* **Resolve duplicates**.\n+  It is often that the same issue is already reported in the Jenkins database.\n+  Newly reported duplicates can be just resolved with a `Duplicate` resolution, and linked to the original issue.\n+\n+=== HOWTO: Triage by maintainers\n+\n+Further triage focuses on confirming the issue and defining a potential resolution.\n+It can be performed by _Issue Triage Team Members_ if they want to dive deeper,\n+or they can leave it to component maintainers.\n+\n+Triage objectives:\n+\n+* **Confirm reported defects**. Try to reproduce the issue or analyze the codebase.\n+  If the issue is legitimate, it is great to explicitly confirm it in a comment.\n+* Nice2Have: **Define next steps**.\n+  If possible, define a potential resolution for the issue.\n+  If you do not plan to work on the issue in foreseeable future,\n+  it is great to explicitly highlight that by unassigning the issue and inviting the reporter and other contributors to submit a fix.\n+* Nice2Have: **Highlight newcomer-friendly issues**.\n+  Newcomer-friendly issues are instrumental for an onboarding new code contributors to the project.\n+  They are linked from link:https://www.jenkins.io/participate/code/[contributing guidelines].\n+  If you see a simple issue but do not plan to work on it,\n+  put a `newbie-friendly` label on it so that somebody could pick it up.\n+\n+=== How to scrub issues?\n+\n+In addition to the initial triage, it is a good practice to sometimes review previously reported issues so that we could minimize backlog of issues and simplify search by users.\n+\n+* **Triage reopened issues**.\n+  Same as for newly reported issues, it is great to process reopened issues if they are not acted on by the issue assignees.\n+  Often such issues can be resolved with a request to report a new issue if an issue is reopened due to another issue.\n+* **Resolve stale untriaged issues**.\n+  Issue reporters may become unresponsive before their issue can be fully triaged.\n+  If there is a reported issue which does not contain data for reproducing the issue,\n+  it is fine to resolve them after a 2-week timeout with the `Incomplete` or `Cannot reproduce` resolution.\n+* **Resolve/update obsolete issues**.\n+  Sometimes issues become obsolete due to other changes in the Jenkins core (e.g. feature removal),\n+  and such issues can be closed.\n+  Same for detaching functionality from the Jenkins core and plugins,\n+  issues can be reassigned to the new Jira component so that they are removed from the core backlog.\n+\n+=== Triaging requests for enhancement\n+\n+Requests for enhancement (RFEs) include the `New Feature` and `Improvement` types in Jenkins Jira.\n+They might be more different to triage than bug reports.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "001027419b9e907ea16594ca482be93a07226df2"}, "originalPosition": 139}]}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 306, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-12T19:05:54Z"}}}
