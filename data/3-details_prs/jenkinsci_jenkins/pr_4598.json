Examples\n\nFill-in the Proposed changelog entries section only if there are breaking changes or other changes which may require extra steps from users during the upgrade\n\n\n Appropriate autotests or explanation to why this change has no tests\n[n/a] For dependency updates: links to external changelogs and, if possible, full diffs\n\n\nDesired reviewers\n@mention\n\nMaintainer checklist\nBefore the changes are marked as ready-for-merge:\n\n There are at least 2 approvals for the pull request and no outstanding requests for change\n Conversations in the pull request are over OR it is explicit that a reviewer does not block the change\n Changelog entries in the PR title and/or Proposed changelog entries are correct\n Proper changelog labels are set so that the changelog can be generated automatically\n If the change needs additional upgrade steps from users, upgrade-guide-needed label is set and there is a Proposed upgrade guidelines section in the PR title.
