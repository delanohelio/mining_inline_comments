Examples\n\nFill-in the Proposed changelog entries section only if there are breaking changes or other changes which may require extra steps from users during the upgrade\n\n\n Appropriate autotests or explanation to why this change has no tests\n For dependency updates: links to external changelogs and, if possible, full diffs\n\n\nDesired reviewers\n@jenkinsci/core-pr-reviewers @vsilverman\n\nMaintainer checklist\nBefore the changes are marked as ready-for-merge:\n\n There are at least 2 approvals for the pull request and no outstanding requests for change\n Conversations in the pull request are over OR it is explicit that a reviewer does not block the change\n Changelog entries in the PR title and/or Proposed changelog entries are correct\n Proper changelog labels are set so that the changelog can be generated automatically\n If the change needs additional upgrade steps from users, upgrade-guide-needed label is set and there is a Proposed upgrade guidelines section in the PR title. (example)\n If it would make sense to backport the change to LTS, a Jira issue must exist, be a Bug or Improvement, and be labeled as lts-candidate to be considered (see query).", "createdAt":

link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting#reporting-issues[Reporting Jenkins Remoting issues]\n+* **Verify the issue component**.\n+  It is essential to ensure that the `component` field references the right component (the Jenkins core, a plugin, etc.)\n+  so that an issue is discoverable processed by a component maintainer.\n+  When moving an issue, assign the issue to the `automatic` assignee so that the maintainer gets notification.\n+  Not all components have a default assignee, and it is perfectly fine to leave the assignee empty.\n+* **Verify the issue type**.\n+  `Bug` should be used for bug reports.\n+  All other issue types are considered as requests for enhancements, and there is no practical difference for the Jenkins core.\n+* **Verify the issue metadata**: Jenkins version, environment, labels, etc.\n+  Such metadata is useful for further triage and issue discoverability.\n+  There are some labels used in Jenkins Jira dashboard and filters, e.g. `jcasc-compatibility`, `java11-compatibility`, `jep-200`, etc.\n+  Assigning such labels helps users and maintainers to discover issues and act on them.\n+  There is no list of such \"common labels\" recommended for use.\n+  Some labels can be found in similar issues or documentation linked from system log entries in the reports.\n+* **Move security issue** to the `SECURITY` project.\n+  Sometimes the issue reporters do

objectives:\n+\n+* **Confirm reported defects**. Try to reproduce the issue or analyze the codebase.\n+  If the issue is legit, it is great to explicitly confirm it in a comment.\n+* Nice2Have: **Define next steps**.\n+  If possible, define a potential resolution for the issue.\n+  If you do not plan to work on the issue in foreseeable future,\n+  it is great to explicitly highlight that by unassigning the issue and inviting the reporter and other contributors to submit a fix.\n+* Nice2Have: **Highlight newcomer-friendly issues**.\n+  Newcomer-friendly issues are instrumental for an onboarding new code contributors to the project.\n+  They are linked from link:https://www.jenkins.io/participate/code/[contributing guidelines].\n+  If you see a simple issue but do not plan to work on it,\n+  put a `newbie-friendly` label on it so that somebody could pick it up.\n+\n+=== How to scrub issues?\n+\n+In addition to the initial triage, it is a good practice to sometimes review previously reported issues so that we could minimize backlog of issues and simplify search by users.\n+\n+* **Triage reopened issues**.\n+  Same as for newly reported issues, it is great to process reopened issues if they are not acted on by the issue assignees.\n+  Often such issues can be resolved with a request to report a new issue if an issue is reopened due to another issue.\n+* **Resolve stale untriaged issues**.\n+  Issue reporters may become unresponsive before their issue can be fully triaged.\n+  If there is a reported issue which does not contain data for reproducing the issue,\n+  it is fine to resolve them after a 2-week timeout with the `Incomplete` or `Cannot reproduce` resolution.\n+* **Resolve/update obsolete issues**.\n+  Sometimes issues become obsolete due to other changes in the Jenkins core (e.g. feature removal),\n+  and such issues can be just closed.\n+  Same for detaching functionality from the Jenkins core and plugins,\n+  issues can be reassigned to the new Jira component so that they do not longer appear in the core backlog.\n+\n+=== Triaging requests for enhancement\n+\n+Requests for enhancement (RFEs) include the `New Feature` and `Improvement` types in Jenkins Jira.\n+They might be more different to triage than bug reports.\n+because it is not always possible to say whether a request should be implemented in the Jenkins core,\n+an existing or a new plugin.\n+In the case of doubt, it is fine to just skip an issue or CC subject matter experts who could advice.\n+\n+For RFEs which are not related to the Jenkins core or plugins,\n+it is possible to set the `plugin-proposals` component.\n+Note that this component is not regularly scrubbed,\n+and it can be considered only as a pool of ideas somebody could implement.\n+It is a good practice to set expectation in a comment when updating the RFE.\n+\n+=== Responding to pings in triaged issues\n+\n+Some submitters and users tend to ping triage contributors to ask about the fix ETA.\n+In some cases, they may also assign the issue and keep pinging.\n+It is fine to not answer these questions on such pings and to refer requestors to this document,\n+triage team members are not responsible for handling the ticket after initial triage.\n+\n+Other materials which might help:\n+\n+* link:https://www.jenkins.io/participate/code/[Contribute to Jenkins / Code] or \n+  link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md[Contributing to the Jenkins Core] - \n+  extended version of \"feel free to contribute\".\n+*

link:https://www.jenkins.io/project/conduct/[Jenkins Code of Conduct] -\n+when it gets ugly.\n+\n+=== Resolving vs. Closing issues\n+\n+Jira workflow for the `JENKINS` project has two similar states: `Resolved` and `Closed`.\n+Historically the issues are rarely being **closed**, and all dashboard and Jenkins processes interpret resolved issues as closed.\n+The main difference is that the _Resolved_ issues can e reopened by users while _Closed_ ones can be reopened by admins only.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid":

Try to reproduce the issue or analyze the codebase.\n+  If the issue is legitimate, it is great to explicitly confirm it in a comment.\n+* Nice2Have: **Define next steps**.\n+  If possible, define a potential resolution for the issue.\n+  If you do not plan to work on the issue in foreseeable future,\n+  it is great to explicitly highlight that by unassigning the issue and inviting the reporter and other contributors to submit a fix.\n+* Nice2Have: **Highlight newcomer-friendly issues**.\n+  Newcomer-friendly issues are instrumental for an onboarding new code contributors to the project.\n+  They are linked from link:https://www.jenkins.io/participate/code/[contributing guidelines].\n+  If you see a simple issue but do not plan to work on it,\n+  put a `newbie-friendly` label on it so that somebody could pick it up.\n+\n+=== How to scrub issues?\n+\n+In addition to the initial triage, it is a good practice to sometimes review previously reported issues so that we could minimize backlog of issues and simplify search by users.\n+\n+* **Triage reopened issues**.\n+  Same as for newly reported issues, it is great to process reopened issues if they are not acted on by the issue assignees.\n+  Often such issues can be resolved with a request to report a new issue if an issue is reopened due to another issue.\n+* **Resolve stale untriaged issues**.\n+  Issue reporters may become unresponsive before their issue can be fully triaged.\n+  If there is a reported issue which does not contain data for reproducing the issue,\n+  it is fine to resolve them after a 2-week timeout with the `Incomplete` or `Cannot reproduce` resolution.\n+* **Resolve/update obsolete issues**.\n+  Sometimes issues become obsolete due to other changes in the Jenkins core (e.g. feature removal),\n+  and such issues can be closed.\n+  Same for detaching functionality from the Jenkins core and plugins,\n+  issues can be reassigned to the new Jira component so that they are removed from the core backlog.\n+\n+=== Triaging requests for enhancement\n+\n+Requests for enhancement (RFEs) include the `New Feature` and `Improvement` types in Jenkins Jira.\n+They might be more different to triage than bug reports.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "001027419b9e907ea16594ca482be93a07226df2"}, "originalPosition": 139}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDQ4MTA5OTU0", "url": "https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/4847#pullrequestreview-448109954", "createdAt": "2020-07-14T13:34:01Z", "commit": {"oid": "001027419b9e907ea16594ca482be93a07226df2"}, "state": "APPROVED", "comments": {"totalCount": 0, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": null, "endCursor": null, "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": []}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "b68413e937e06db8796a520fd7143bf6f85429f1", "author": {"user": {"login": "oleg-nenashev", "name": "Oleg Nenashev"}}, "url": "https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/b68413e937e06db8796a520fd7143bf6f85429f1", "committedDate": "2020-07-14T13:40:23Z", "message": "Update docs/MAINTAINERS.adoc"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "9c7de437ea8191ddaf5b7fbbc0f15ad9af09f6e5", "author": {"user": {"login": "oleg-nenashev", "name": "Oleg Nenashev"}}, "url": "https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/9c7de437ea8191ddaf5b7fbbc0f15ad9af09f6e5", "committedDate": "2020-07-14T13:41:20Z", "message": "Apply suggestions from code review\n\nCo-authored-by: stellargo <sumitsarinofficial@gmail.com>"}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 2142, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-10-28T18:54:27Z"}}}
