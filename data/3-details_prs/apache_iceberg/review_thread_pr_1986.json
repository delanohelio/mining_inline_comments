I think we can follow what Spark does for regular SQL INSERTs and resolve struct fields by position, not by name like this PR does now.\nNot resolving nested fields by name may lead to unexpected results from the user perspective but we have this problem inside INSERT statements already. Spark ignores column names inside INSERTs and adds aliases if needed.\nAre we ok ignoring column names inside MERGE too?
