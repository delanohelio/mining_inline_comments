However, I see similar classes that inherit from the higher up TableOperations interface which this also inherits from which implements their own version of refresh which does not rely on this abstract class. The example I'm thinking of is  HadoopTableOperations.\nIn any case, if this call to doRefresh throws a NoSuchTableException, currently it logs it, resets some of the private fields to null / their respective empty values (e.g. -1 for version in this abstract class when it's an int, though in HadoopTableOperations which implements TableOperations it's not an int but a volatile Integer whose empty value is null).\nI guess my question is, I can't quite see where this call to this particular version of refresh is being accessed. When do we use BaseMetastoreTableOperations as opposed to one of the other implementations of TableOperations such as HadoopTableOperations? How can I determine when a specific TableOperations is being used? Additionally, as this class is marked as abstract but yet I can't find anything that extends / implements it, why do we have it? I also see that there is a python version of this class, so is it possible that the python version of the class is why this particular abstract class exists?\nAdditionally, In the log.debug case you're adding, I imagine that it is likely still necessary to set the current metadata and related fields to null / their empty values. However, do we still intend to rethrow the exception like it currently is done? Looking through the code, I think it would possibly break things if we don't rethrow, such as BaseTransaction#commitReplaceTransaction(boolean orCreate) in the case that we're expecting the table to already exist (e.g. when the transaction is not allowed to create the table, that is if the transaction is not of type CREATE_OR_REPLACE_TABLE when calling commitReplaceTransaction).\nSo I have a few questions:\n\nWhy do we have this abstract base class BaseMetastoreTableOperations if nothing implements / extends it? I've mentioned a few reasons above, particularly the corresponding python class which is somewhat more complete.\nHow can we be sure when this version of TableOperations is in play vs any other? I'm assuming that when we're connected to an actual Hive Metastore (vs using Hadoop filesystem and table properties for the metadata), then this class comes into play, but since it's abstract and not extended I fail to see how that's possible.\nThe current behavior is to rethrow the exception. In the case that we are using the debug log, do we know that the upstream callers will catch this and not additionally add their own logs of a higher level and/or are we concerned that we are rethrowing the NoSuchIcebergTableException?\n\nPlease let me know if you need me to clean up / reexplain some of my questioning, as I know it's somewhat convoluted. I'm doing my best to understand when this class comes into play and how but a little bit of assistance from somebody who knows much more than I do (or a link to possible documentation about it) would really help me out.

It is also the recommended way to support a custom metastore, which is what we do at Netflix.\nThe reason why this warning exists is to catch the case where a table is deleted concurrently. The Hive implementation throws the exception when current metadata is not null but the table doesn't exist. The table instance needs to be in a consistent state if it is reused for a create, which is why we set the metadata to null. At the time, we considered NoSuchTableException to be more rare than it is with the wrapped catalogs.\nI think a better solution is to log the warning only when the table previously had metadata. What we could do is check before calling doRefresh whether currentMetadata is null. If it is not, then we want to log the warning. Otherwise, we should let it go through.
