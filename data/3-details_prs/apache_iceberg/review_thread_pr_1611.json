I'll try to consolidate twos into one.\nI still think we'd better having two different matrixes for create table and read/write (consolidated, Iceberg types to (->) Spark types), because in many cases the type to pivot on create table in Spark is Spark type (as these types are what end users need to type in), while the type to pivot on read/write table in any engines is Iceberg type. I thought the type to pivot on write to table is engine's column type but I changed my mind as the types of columns are Iceberg types hence end users need to think based on these types.\nIt might be arguable that end users need to think about the final type of the column (Iceberg type) when creating table, which might end up with pivoting Iceberg type on create table. I don't have a strong opinion, as it's also a valid opinion, but there might be also someone who wants to see the Iceberg table as Spark's world of view (restrict the usage to Spark only) and don't want to concern about Iceberg types.\nEither of the direction would be fine for me.
