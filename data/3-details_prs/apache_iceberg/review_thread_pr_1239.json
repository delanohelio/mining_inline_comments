It seems that the sharedTable being used in each test can have a different state depending upon the order of execution of the tests as it is initialized only once before all tests run. Also,  the data records file1FirstSnapshotRecords etc are being initialized by each test on their own, maybe we could make them constants. I don't think we need to take action on this though, if u all agree we can take it up as a separate task.", "url": "https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1239#discussion_r461400750", "createdAt": "2020-07-28T08:15:12Z", "author": {"login": "rdsr"}, "path": "data/src/test/java/org/apache/iceberg/data/TestLocalScan.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -174,6 +174,64 @@ private void overwriteExistingData() throws IOException {\n         .commit();\n   }\n \n+  private void appendData() throws IOException {", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "db9eaf0abef9ef3ef41986ffa50d72b893bcfb5f"}, "originalPosition": 4}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2MTQxOTcwOQ==", "bodyText": "Agree with you.
