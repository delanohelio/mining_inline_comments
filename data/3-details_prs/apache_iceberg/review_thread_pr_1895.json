The relevant sections from that page are:\n\nSoftware under the following licenses may be included in binary form within an Apache product if the inclusion is appropriately labeled (see above)\n\n\nBy including only the object/binary form, there is less exposed surface area of the third-party work from which a work might be derived; this addresses the second guiding principle of this policy.\n\nAnd here's the part about labelling:\n\nAPPROPRIATELY LABELLED CONDITION\nIn all Category B cases our users should not be surprised at their inclusion in our products. By attaching an appropriate and prominent label to the distribution users are less likely to be unaware of restrictions significantly different from those of the Apache License. An appropriate and prominent label is a label the user will read while learning about the distribution - for example in a README, and it should identify the third-party product, its licensing, and a url to the its homepage. Please also ensure to comply with any attribution/notice requirements in the specific license in question.\n\nI think that means we will need a \"prominent label\" that a user will read while learning about the distribution. I would add one as a new section to the project's README, as well as on the releases page. We should also link to it from anywhere we recommend downloading a runtime Jar on the site. We should also add any notes needed to comply with EPL's requirements.\nIs it possible to remove this dependency?
