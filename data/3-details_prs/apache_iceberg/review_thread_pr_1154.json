I personally don't like the way in the arguments it puts the exception first and the message second, I find this confusing as most other Java Exceptions do it the other way around.

Here's the context:\n\nWe want to make it easy to add context into exception messages. It is too common that an exception tells you what happened, but not where it happened. So you might have a NullPointerException when writing a record field and not be told which field you need to go look at. The idea behind adding String.format into the constructors is to make it as easy as possible to build good exception messages.\nBecause we accept a format string and Object... for message formatting, we can't add the wrapped exception at the end of the arg list. The varargs parameter always consumes it. So we had to move it to the beginning.\n\nI though this was a reasonable trade-off for better exception messages.
