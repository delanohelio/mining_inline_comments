Once the returned stage has completed the store is assumed to be in working condition\n+ * for other operations to be performed upon it. Infinispan will guarantee visibility of variables written during\n+ * the start method, so there is no need to synchronize these manually, unless they are mutated in the normal operations\n+ * of the store itself.\n+ * <p>\n+ * Infinispan may at any point after this store has started query what characteristics this store has via\n+ * {@link #characteristics()}. It is highly recommended that this method never change what values it returns once the\n+ * store has been started as these may or may not be cached. For more information on how the characteristics affect\n+ * the store operations, please see {@link Characteristic} and its various values.\n+ * <p>\n+ * By default this store only requires half a dozen or so methods to be implemented. However, there are more\n+ * optional methods that may be implemented. If you implement such a method, please be sure to advertise the appropriate\n+ * characteristic for that method, so Infinispan knows to invoke it. Note that if Infinispan has been told a\n+ * characteristic is available and the method is not overridden, an {@link UnsupportedOperationException} will be\n+ * thrown when trying to invoke the appropriate method. Each {@link Characteristic} defines what methods map to which\n+ * characteristic.\n+ * <p>\n+ * All methods that are able include segment arguments in them, such as {@link #load(int, Object)} and\n+ * {@link #publishEntries(IntSet, Predicate, boolean)}. It is not required, but recommended if possible, for a store\n+ * to support segmentation. An Infinispan Cache can perform much more efficiently when segmentation is supported when\n+ * performing bulk operations such as {@code Cache.size()} or {@code Cache.entrySet().stream()}. It also can very greatly\n+ * increase state transfer time, when {@link PersistenceConfiguration#fetchPersistentState()} is enabled and also when\n+ * removing data by segments. Ensure that it the store implementation supports segmentation that it returns the\n+ * {@link Characteristic#SEGMENTABLE} characteristic when {@link #characteristics()} is invoked. A store implementation\n+ * can tell if segmentation is enabled by checking the store configuration {@link StoreConfiguration#segmented()} available\n+ * from the {@code InitializationContext}.\n+ * <p>\n+ * Some stores may have to interact with blocking APIs to perform their desired operation.
