module\n+\n+{brandname} version 11 introduces an experimental module that allows scaling up a cluster\n+and adding new nodes without expensive *state transfer*.\n+\n+\n+== Background\n+\n+For background, the preferred way to scale up the storage capacity of a {brandname} cluster\n+is to use distributed caches.\n+A distributed cache stores each key/value pair on `num-owners` nodes,\n+and each node can compute the location of a key (aka the key owners) directly.\n+\n+{brandname} achieves this by statically mapping cache keys to `num-segments` *consistent hash segments*,\n+and then dynamically mapping segments to nodes based on the cache's *topology*\n+(roughly the current plus the historical membership of the cache).\n+Whenever a new node joins the cluster, the cache is *rebalanced*, and the new node replaces an existing node\n+as the owner of some segments.\n+The key/value pairs in those segments are copied to the new node and removed from the no-longer-owner node\n+via *state transfer*.\n+\n+NOTE: Because the allocation of segments to nodes is based on random UUIDs generated at start time,\n+it is common (though less so after\n+link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ISPN-11679[ISPN-11679]\n+), for segments to also move from one old node to another old node.\n+\n+\n+== Architecture\n+\n+The basic idea is to skip the static mapping of keys to segments and to map keys directly to nodes.\n+\n+When a key/value pair is inserted into the cache,\n+the newest member becomes the **anchor owner** of that key, and the only node storing the actual value.\n+In order to make the anchor location available without an extra remote lookup,\n+all the other nodes store a reference to the anchor owner.\n+\n+That way, when another node joins, it only needs to receive the location information from the existing nodes,\n+and values can stay on the anchor owner, minimizing the amount of traffic.\n+\n+\n+== Limitations\n+\n+Only one node can be added at a time::\n+An external actor (e.g. a Kubernetes/OpenShift operator, or a human administrator)\n+must monitor the load on the current nodes, and add a new node whenever the newest node\n+is close to \"full\".\n+\n+NOTE: Because the anchor owner information is replicated on all the nodes, and values are never moved off a node,\n+the memory usage of each node will keep growing as new entries and nodes are added.\n+\n+There is no redundancy::\n+Every value is only stored on a single node.\n+When a node crashes or even stops gracefully, the values stored on that node are lost.\n+\n+Transactions are not supported::\n+A later version may add transaction support, but the fact that any node stop or crash\n+loses entries makes transactions a lot less valuable compared to a distributed cache.\n+\n+Hot Rod clients do not know the anchor owner::\n+Hot Rod clients cannot use the topology information from the servers to locate the anchor owner.\n+Instead, the server receiving a Hot Rod get request must make an additional request to the anchor owner\n+in order to retrieve the value.\n+\n+\n+== Configuration\n+\n+The module is still very young and does not yet support many Infinispan features.\n+\n+Eventually, if it proves useful, it may become another cache mode, just like scattered caches.\n+For now, configuring a cache with anchored keys requires a
