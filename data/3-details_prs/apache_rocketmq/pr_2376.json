Notice, it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR.\n\n Make sure there is a Github issue filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\n Format the pull request title like [ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\n Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\n Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in test module.\n Run mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle to make sure basic checks pass. Run mvn clean install -DskipITs to make sure unit-test pass. Run mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test  to make sure integration-test pass.\n If this contribution is large, please file an Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement.", "createdAt": "2020-10-26T07:25:41Z", "url": "https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/2376", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "c286600ca14a4b45eaf12ae76184165b9aee791a"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-11-13T01:49:58Z", "author": {"login": "zhangjidi2016"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 4, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABdWPIE5AH2gAyNTA5ODI4NzYzOmEyODUyNTlkOGEwOThmZjE3ODhkMzVhN2VkNjdlOWUzYzljM2NmYmQ=", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABdb9JnRAFqTUyOTY0MzgyOA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "a285259d8a098ff1788d35a7ed67e9e3c9c3cfbd", "author": {"user": null}, "url": "https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/commit/a285259d8a098ff1788d35a7ed67e9e3c9c3cfbd", "committedDate": "2020-10-26T07:20:58Z", "message": "Fix error in ipCheck method"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NTE2Njc4MzQ5", "url": "https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/2376#pullrequestreview-516678349", "createdAt": "2020-10-26T11:18:30Z", "commit": {"oid": "a285259d8a098ff1788d35a7ed67e9e3c9c3cfbd"}, "state": "APPROVED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMC0yNlQxMToxODozMFrOHoLDMw==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMC0yNlQxMToxODozMFrOHoLDMw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxMTg4NjEzMQ==", "bodyText": "Is it a necessary judgment here?
