Please adjust accordingly per\n+your needs. Each connection will open a persistent gRPC channel to one of configured Hedera nodes. The transaction\n+publisher will round-robin this list of connections to determine which node to send to, ensuring the load is distributed\n+evenly across all nodes.\n+\n+The `type` property specifies which transaction type to publish.

Each scenario has a target transactions per second (TPS) and uses a client side rate limiter to\n+achieve the desired rate. Additionally, a percentage of receipts or records can be requested for each transaction to\n+verify transactions are reaching consensus.\n+\n+The monitor can be used to publish at very high TPS, with a single monitor being able to max out the current capability\n+of the Hedera network. To publish at higher rates, the `hedera.mirror.monitor.publish.connections` property will need to\n+be increased. For example, to achieve 10K TPS we set the number of connections to 1000. Please adjust accordingly per\n+your needs. Each connection will open a persistent gRPC channel to one of configured Hedera nodes. The transaction\n+publisher will round-robin this list of connections to determine which node to send to, ensuring the load is distributed\n+evenly across all nodes.\n+\n+The `type` property specifies which transaction type to publish. It also affects which `properties` need to be\n+specified, with different transaction types requiring different properties to be set. See the\n+[TransactionType](/hedera-mirror-datagenerator/src/main/java/com/hedera/datagenerator/sdk/supplier/TransactionType.java)\n+enum for a list of possible values for `type`. The properties can be seen as fields on the various\n+[TransactionSupplier](/hedera-mirror-datagenerator/src/main/java/com/hedera/datagenerator/sdk/supplier) classes that\n+the `TransactionType` enum references. Most of these properties have a default and don't need to be explicitly\n+specified, but some are empty and may need to be populated.\n+\n+For example, if you want to publish a topic message, you would open the `TransactionType` class,\n+find `CONSENSUS_SUBMIT_MESSAGE`, then open the\n+[ConsensusSubmitMessageTransactionSupplier](/hedera-mirror-datagenerator/src/main/java/com/hedera/datagenerator/sdk/supplier/consensus/ConsensusSubmitMessageTransactionSupplier.java)\n+class that it references. From there, you can see that fields `maxTransactionFee`, `message`, `retry`\n+and `topicId` are available as properties. Only `topicId` doesn't have a default and will be required. Here's a YAML\n+excerpt that specifies some of those properties:\n+\n+```yaml\n+publish:\n+  scenarios:\n+    - name: HCS Pinger\n+      properties:\n+        maxTransactionFee: 1000000\n+        message: Hello world!\n+        retry: true\n+        topicId: 0.0.1000\n+      record: 1.0\n+      tps: 0.1\n+      type: CONSENSUS_SUBMIT_MESSAGE\n+```\n+\n+### Expression Syntax\n+\n+The monitor can automatically create account, token or topic entities on application startup using a special expression\n+syntax. This is useful to avoid boilerplate configuration and manual entity creation steps that vary per environment.\n+The syntax can currently only be used in `hedera.mirror.monitor.publish.scenarios.properties`\n+and `hedera.mirror.monitor.subscribe.grpc.topicId`.\n+\n+The syntax takes the form of `${type.name}` where `type` is one of `account`, `token` or `topic` and `name` is a\n+descriptive label. Based upon the entity type, it will create the appropriate entity on the network with default values.\n+The name label allows the same entity to be referenced in multiple places but only created once.\n+\n+The following example uses the expression syntax to create the sender and recipient accounts as well as a token. These\n+same entities are created once and reused in both the token associate and the token transfer transaction.\n+\n+```yaml\n+scenarios:\n+  - name: HTS associate\n+    limit: 1\n+    properties:\n+      accountId: ${account.them}\n+      tokenId: ${token.foobar}\n+    tps: 1\n+    type: TOKEN_ASSOCIATE\n+  - name: HTS transfer\n+    properties:\n+      recipientAccountId: ${account.them}\n+      senderAccountId: ${account.me}\n+      tokenId: ${token.foobar}\n+      transferType: BOTH\n+    tps: 1\n+    type: CRYPTO_TRANSFER\n+```\n+\n+### Subscribe\n+\n+The monitor can optionally subscribe to either the mirror node gRPC or REST APIs.

It supports\n+both publishing transactions to HAPI and subscribing to the mirror node API. Configuration is flexible and declarative\n+allowing one to express a mixture of transactions, their expected rate of publish and the tool will do its best to make\n+it so. By default, the monitor is already setup with a basic scenario that creates a topic, submits a message every 10\n+seconds to it and verifies the messages is received via the mirror node's gRPC and REST APIs.\n+\n+## Configuration\n+\n+This section covers the higher level properties to consider before diving into the specific publish and subscribe\n+properties in the next sections. For a full list of configuration options see the [config](/docs/configuration.md)\n+documentation.\n+\n+First, make sure you are configured to talk to the correct Hedera network by setting `hedera.mirror.monitor.network` to\n+`MAINNET`, `PREVIEWNET` or `TESTNET`. If it's not one of these public environments, the network can be set to `OTHER`\n+and `hedera.mirror.monitor.nodes` and `hedera.mirror.monitor.mirrorNode` properties should be filled in.\n+\n+Additionally, the operator information in `hedera.mirror.monitor.operator` is required and needs to be populated with a\n+valid payer account ID and its private key. Ensure this account has the necessary funds to publish transactions at the\n+rate you desire. The following is an example with a custom network configured:\n+\n+```yaml\n+hedera:\n+  mirror:\n+    monitor:\n+      mirrorNode:\n+        grpc:\n+          host: 34.69.90.179\n+          port: 5600\n+        rest:\n+          host: 35.239.255.55\n+          port: 80\n+      network: OTHER\n+      nodes:\n+        - accountId: 0.0.3\n+          host: 34.94.106.61\n+        - accountId: 0.0.4\n+          host: 35.237.119.55\n+        - accountId: 0.0.5\n+          host: 35.245.27.193\n+        - accountId: 0.0.6\n+          host: 34.83.112.116\n+      operator:\n+        accountId: 0.0.1234\n+        privateKey: 104...\n+```\n+\n+### Publish\n+\n+The monitor can be configured to publish multiple transaction types concurrently. It does this be specifying a list of\n+scenarios that should actively publish. A unique scenario name is used as a label for metrics so that each scenario can\n+be monitored separately. Each scenario has a target transactions per second (TPS) and uses a client side rate limiter to\n+achieve the desired rate.
