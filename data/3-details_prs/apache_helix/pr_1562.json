Also, the family of Verifiers were having a similar issue. This change solves this by making sure the private/protected constructors used by the Builders of these classes set the flag correctly to false so that in their respective close() functions, the underlying zkClient (created by the Builder) would get closed.\nTests\n\n The following tests are written for this issue:\n\nManually monitored and tested\n\n The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\n\n\n[INFO]\n[INFO] Results:\n[INFO]\n[INFO] Tests run: 1251, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\n[INFO]\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[INFO] Total time:  01:25 h\n\nDocumentation (Optional)\n\nIn case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\n\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\nCommits\n\nMy commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.
