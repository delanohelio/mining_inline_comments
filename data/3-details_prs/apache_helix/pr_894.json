This will fail unless ZkBucketDataAccessor was also made realm-aware. We can simply use a FederatedZkClient here since BucketDataAccessor does not support ephemeral operations.\nTests\nSee #892 for testing.\nCommits\n\n My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.
