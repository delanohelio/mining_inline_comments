Lots of validators were updated to take advantage of\nthis and be more efficient (particularly HTTP validators and trait\nconflict validators).\nI also noticed that the TraitValueValidator was validating the prelude\nmodel, and that was pretty expensive. I updated this validator to only\nvalidate the prelude when a specific metadata property is set. Then, in\nunit tests, I added a test that ensures that the validator validates the\nprelude so that we can be sure that changes made to the prelude are\nvalid. Because of this change and the trait indexing, JMH shows that the\ntime to load and validate a model was nearly cut in half\n(from about 2ms to 1ms on my old laptop).\nI noticed that the UnstableFeatureValidator was still being used on\ndocument shapes even though the spec was updated to remove the\ndisclaimer that document shapes are unstable, so I removed this\nvalidator.\nIssue #, if available:\nDescription of changes:\nBy submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.", "createdAt": "2020-05-02T22:10:59Z", "url": "https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/412", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "20d10458aca4a7625d0ac88d04a9412262fe82ae"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-05-04T19:53:27Z", "author": {"login": "mtdowling"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 6, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABcdg_bsABqjMyOTY5NzY0ODU=", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABceE-nAgFqTQwNTI5Nzg4MA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "HeadRefForcePushedEvent", "beforeCommit": {"oid": "3ebe5db284b3e677a6da5cfe405afcd00f398bc9", "author": {"user": {"login": "mtdowling", "name": "Michael Dowling"}}, "url": "https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/commit/3ebe5db284b3e677a6da5cfe405afcd00f398bc9", "committedDate": "2020-05-02T22:03:09Z", "message": "Improve validators through a trait index on model\n\nThis commit is a fairly large update to validators because there's a new\nsuper useful feature on Model where you can now get a Set of shapes that\nhave a specific trait (and the value is cached).
