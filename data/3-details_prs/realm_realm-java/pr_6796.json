the following:\nRealmApp should be considered a user factory instead of \"user\" in itself, so all methods that required a currentUser should be moved to RealmUser, while the methods for joggling between users and login stay on RealmApp. This is a mix of the old Realm approach with everything on SyncUser and the old Stitch approach where everything was on StitchApp, but we felt it strikes a good balance between having multiple \"active\" users, and the current capabilities Stitch has.\nRealmApp:\n\nLogin\nEmailPasswordAuthProvider\nCurrentUser\nAllUSers\nEverything related to configuring the network\n\nRealmUser:\n\nApiKeyAuthProvider\nlinkUser\nremoveUser\nPush Notifications\nMongoDB Services\nFunctions\nCustom Data\nlogOut\n\nComing in the Sync PR, we also agreed to move back to the old way of creating SyncConfigurations, so it will now become:\n// New approach and \"oldest\" approach for synced Ralms\nval realm = Realm(SyncConfiguration.Builder(user, \"partion-value\").build())\n\n// Current approach, which was a compromise to reduce mental overhead\n// of the URL weirdness\nval realm = Realm(user.createConfiguration(\"partion-key\").build())\n\nThis also means that getDefaultConfiguration and createConfiguration will not be added to RealmUser (they are not there right now).",
