For Chrome, you may have to run tests one at a time as multiple ChromeDriver instances cannot be opened with the same user data.\n+\n+<sup>1</sup> This setup is necessary because our test suite uses the Gmail API to access Gmail accounts used for testing (these accounts are specified in `test.properties`) to confirm that those accounts receive the expected emails from TEAMMATES.\n+This is needed only when testing against a production server because no actual emails are sent by the dev server and therefore delivery of emails is not tested when testing against the dev server.\n+\n+## Creating E2E tests\n+  \n+As E2E tests should be written from the end user perspective, each test case should reflect some user workflow.   \n+  \n+In TEAMMATES, E2E test cases are organized by page. For each page, we:  \n+1. Identify the important user workflows  \n+1. Simulate the user actions involved in the workflow by interacting with the UI elements.  \n+1. Assert the expected conditions are present after the interaction.  \n+  \n+[Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) is used to locate and interact with elements in the UI.   \n+  \n+All E2E test classes inherit from `BaseE2ETestCase` which contains methods that are common to most test cases, such as preparing the `Browser` object used for testing.   \n+  \n+To help verify the state of the datastore, `BackDoor` contains methods to create API calls to the back-end without going through the UI. \n+  \n+### Page Object Pattern\n+  \n+In order to make E2E testing more robust to UI changes, the [Page Object Pattern](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/PageObject.html) is adopted.  \n+  \n+Each page in TEAMMATES is represented by a page object class. The page object class abstracts interactions with UI elements and only exposes the functionality of each page as methods.   \n+- This way only the page object classes require updating when there are UI changes  \n+- Without Page Object Pattern, all test cases that use the changed UI element would require updating  \n+  \n+To maximise the effectiveness of Page Object Pattern, interaction with UI elements should not occur outside the page objects.   \n+  \n+  \n+### Creating Page Objects\n+  \n+The page object should have methods to represent the main functionality of the page that testers can use to simulate user actions.   \n+- The public methods for page objects should avoid exposing the UI elements it interacts with and instead focus on the functionality of the webpage.   \n+- For example, instead of having methods like `fillSearchBox` and `clickSearchButton`, it is better to have a method `searchForInstructor` which hides the UI elements used.    \n+\n+All Page Object classes inherit from `AppPage` which contains methods that are common for interacting with the web elements such as filling in textboxes.   \n+  \n+  \n+### Things to avoid when writing E2E tests\n+  \n+1. **Testing based on implementation** - The focus should be on user actions instead of implementation details. Therefore, black box testing should be adopted and test cases should be designed around use cases.   \n+1. **Excessive exception testing** - Testing edge cases with E2E tests should be avoided. This is because E2E tests are expensive to run and not that effective for isolating bugs. Hence we should focus on the happy path and exception paths that are more common. We can test more exhaustively with lower-level unit or integration tests.
