When passing the parameter `shouldCreateJmxFile` as `true`, an equivalent `.jmx` file can be generated from this test plan.\n+\n To help with debugging, you can open this `.jmx` file in the JMeter GUI and add Listeners.\n \n To see a sample implementation of a test case, you can refer to `StudentProfileLNPTest`. It is a _simple_ test case which load tests a GET endpoint (`/webapi/student/profile`).\n \n ## Running Performance Tests\n \n If you want to use your own copy of [JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi), update the `test.jmeter.*` properties in `src/e2e/resources/test.properties` accordingly.  \n-Start the backend server, i.e. `localhost:8080`, before running the performance tests.\n+\n+First, open the terminal and navigate to the root of project folder.
