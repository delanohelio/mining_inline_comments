While we do some operations with GameProfiles, they mirror what Users we think have been created - we're not caching GameProfiles.\nThe file system watching is in, but all GameProfile caching is delegated to the PlayerProfileCache, which we just get profiles from when required.\nIt needs some testing, but it seems to at least grab the right user file and I can see it stores the UUIDs of the files that exist - which is the point really.\nNote that I have not brought over the notion that banned/whitelisted profiles necessarily have a User attached - they don't! If you want a users associated with a banned player, get the banned user's profile and create it.\nCloses #3059", "createdAt": "2020-07-15T20:49:58Z", "url": "https://github.com/SpongePowered/Sponge/pull/3067", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "a6297e383b671f011d4a56c4f84bde663f5ed15a"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-07-17T19:41:51Z", "author": {"login": "dualspiral"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 5, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABc1lJBygBqjM1NTQ5OTY5MDI=", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABc15KK9ABqjM1NTk2MDczNjY=", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "HeadRefForcePushedEvent", "beforeCommit": {"oid": "54449d59514fdec102b4b7f7814310bc30ecef8a", "author": {"user": {"login": "dualspiral", "name": "Daniel Naylor"}}, "url": "https://github.com/SpongePowered/Sponge/commit/54449d59514fdec102b4b7f7814310bc30ecef8a", "committedDate": "2020-07-16T20:14:30Z", "message": "Let's not enable this for mainline"}, "afterCommit": {"oid": "aa6dd4404bec9d30030d8a68f6d4ac704594daae", "author": {"user": {"login": "dualspiral", "name": "Daniel Naylor"}}, "url": "https://github.com/SpongePowered/Sponge/commit/aa6dd4404bec9d30030d8a68f6d4ac704594daae", "committedDate": "2020-07-16T19:56:05Z", "message": "Save the username cache json when we save the worlds"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDUwODY5ODYx", "url": "https://github.com/SpongePowered/Sponge/pull/3067#pullrequestreview-450869861", "createdAt": "2020-07-17T18:24:38Z", "commit": {"oid": "690ba27f296934e57e128d9de2b050be9c09af50"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNy0xN1QxODoyNDozOFrOGzc8cw==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNy0xN1QxODoyNDozOFrOGzc8cw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ1NjYwNDc4Nw==", "bodyText": "This method (getUser) is equivalent to this.getUser(this.server.getPlayerProfileCache().getProfileByUUID(uuid), true);", "url": "https://github.com/SpongePowered/Sponge/pull/3067#discussion_r456604787", "createdAt": "2020-07-17T18:24:38Z", "author": {"login": "ImMorpheus"}, "path": "src/main/java/org/spongepowered/common/user/ServerUserProvider.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,336 @@\n+/*\n+ * This file is part of Sponge, licensed under the MIT License (MIT).\n+ *\n+ * Copyright (c) SpongePowered <https://www.spongepowered.org>\n+ * Copyright (c) contributors\n+ *\n+ * Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\n+ * of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\n+ * in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\n+ * to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\n+ * copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\n+ * furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n+ *\n+ * The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\n+ * all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n+ *\n+ * THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\n+ * IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n+ * FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
