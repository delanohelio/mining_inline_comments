When vanish is false, the entity in question should unquestionably be collidable. I'm a little worried that we're getting into a spiderweb here where we have a bridge method named one thing and the key named the other.\nOne school of thought is setting VANISH_IGNORES_COLLISION and VANISH_PREVENTS_TARGETING to true should not be cleared by setting VANISH to false. That feels largely expected and I err on the side of agreeing with that. I'm thus not against this change myself, but we need to make other changes to insulate ourselves against other issues.\nHowever, I know this is in impl, but bridge$setUncollideable and bridge$setUntargetable should really be named better to indicate that they are on vanish only. Their representive is methods should then be renamed similarly AND include a vanish check within their bodies. I'd rather check one method for collisions, rather than tacking on a vanish check everywhere too because it's not obvious that's what needs to happen.\nIf we want/need separate non-vanish uncollidable/targetting states then we need to think about that more, because we now need to think about how this will work with the vanish based states.", "url": "https://github.com/SpongePowered/Sponge/pull/2595#discussion_r419083856", "createdAt": "2020-05-03T10:39:53Z", "author": {"login": "dualspiral"}, "path": "src/main/java/org/spongepowered/common/data/processor/multi/entity/InvisibilityDataProcessor.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -67,13 +67,9 @@ protected boolean set(final VanishableBridge dataHolder, final Map<Key<?>, Objec\n         final boolean untargetable = (Boolean) keyValues.get(Keys.VANISH_PREVENTS_TARGETING);\n         final boolean vanish = (Boolean) keyValues.get(Keys.VANISH);\n         dataHolder.bridge$setInvisible(invis);\n-        if (vanish) {\n-            dataHolder.bridge$setVanished(true);\n-            dataHolder.bridge$setUncollideable(collision);\n-            dataHolder.bridge$setUntargetable(untargetable);\n-        } else {\n-            dataHolder.bridge$setVanished(false);\n-        }\n+        dataHolder.bridge$setVanished(vanish);\n+        dataHolder.bridge$setUncollideable(collision);", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "4d5c38b40d6febd9fd3ebcfe480b24d54107440f"}, "originalPosition": 12}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQxOTE0NTA5Nw==", "bodyText": "From what I gathered from the implementation and the API  (This state will be ignored if the {@link Entity} is not also vanished as per {@link #VANISH}.) the uncollideable state should be ignored in the implementation, not in the data processor.\n\nOne school of thought is setting VANISH_IGNORES_COLLISION and VANISH_PREVENTS_TARGETING to true should not be cleared by setting VANISH to false.
