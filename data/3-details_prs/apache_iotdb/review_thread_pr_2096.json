You can connect to data sources and perform interactive operations with SQL, Scala, etc. The operations can be saved as documents, just like Jupyter. Zeppelin has already supported many data sources, including Spark, ElasticSearch, Cassandra, and InfluxDB. Now, we have enabled Zeppelin to operate IoTDB via SQL. \n+\n+![image-20201124145203621](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/0081Kckwly1gl09mzzfhzj314q0q70xo.jpg)\n+\n+\n+\n+# IoTDB zeppelin-interpreter\n+\n+## Environment\n+\n+To use IoTDB and Zeppelin, you need to have:\n+\n+1. Java >= 1.8.0_271 (Please make sure the environment path has been set. You can run `java -version` to confirm the current Java version.\n+2. IoTDB >= 0.11.0-SNAPSHOT.\n+3. Zeppelin >= 0.8.2\n+\n+You can install IoTDB according to [IoTDB Quick Start](http://iotdb.apache.org/UserGuide/V0.10.x/Get%20Started/QuickStart.html). IoTDB is placed at `$IoTDB_HOME`.\n+\n+You can download [Zeppelin](https://zeppelin.apache.org/download.html#) and unpack the binary package directly or [build Zeppelin from source](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/latest/setup/basics/how_to_build.html). Zeppelin is placed at `$Zeppelin_HOME`.\n+\n+\n+\n+## Build interpreter\n+\n+```shell\n+cd $IoTDB_HOME\n+mvn clean package -pl zeppelin-interpreter -am -DskipTests\n+```\n+\n+The interpreter will be in the folder:\n+\n+```shell\n+$IoTDB_HOME/zeppelin-interpreter/target/zeppelin-{version}-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar\n+```\n+\n+\n+\n+## Install interpreter\n+\n+Once you have built your interpreter, create a new folder under the Zeppelin interpreter directory and put the built interpreter into it. \n+\n+```shell\n+mkdir $Zeppelin_HOME/interpreter/iotdb\n+cp $IoTDB_HOME/zeppelin-interpreter/target/zeppelin-{version}-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar $Zeppelin_HOME/interpreter/iotdb\n+```\n+\n+\n+\n+##Configure your interpreter\n+\n+To configure your interpreter you need to follow these steps:\n+\n+1. If it's the first start, create `conf/zeppelin-site.xml` by copying `conf/zeppelin-site.xml.template` to `conf/zeppelin-site.xml`.\n+\n+2. Append your interpreter class name to  `zeppelin.interpreters` property in `conf/zeppelin-site.xml`, for example:\n+\n+    ```xml\n+    <configuration>\n+      ...\n+      <property>\n+        <name>zeppelin.interpreters</name>\n+        <value>org.apache.zeppelin.spark.SparkInterpreter,org.apache.zeppelin.spark.PySparkInterpreter,org.apache.zeppelin.spark.SparkSqlInterpreter,org.apache.zeppelin.spark.DepInterpreter,org.apache.zeppelin.markdown.Markdown,org.apache.zeppelin.shell.ShellInterpreter,org.apache.zeppelin.hive.HiveInterpreter,org.apache.iotdb.zeppelin.IoTDBInterpreter</value>\n+      </property>\n+      ...\n+    </configuration>\n+    ```\n+\n+## Running Zeppelin and IoTDB\n+\n+Go to `$Zeppelin_HOME` and start Zeppelin by running: \n+\n+```shell\n+./bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh start\n+```\n+\n+or in Windows:\n+```shell\n+./bin/zeppelin.cmd\n+```\n+\n+Go to `$IoTDB_HOME` and [start IoTDB server](https://github.com/apache/iotdb#start-iotdb):\n+\n+```shell\n+# Unix/OS X\n+> nohup sbin/start-server.sh >/dev/null 2>&1 &\n+or\n+> nohup sbin/start-server.sh -c <conf_path> -rpc_port <rpc_port> >/dev/null 2>&1 &\n+\n+# Windows\n+> sbin\\start-server.bat -c <conf_path> -rpc_port <rpc_port>\n+```\n+\n+## Zeppelin to IoTDB\n+\n+Wait for Zeppelin server to start, then visit http://localhost:8080/\n+\n+1. In the interpreter page: 1.click the `Create new node` button, 2. set the note name and 3. configure your interpreter.
