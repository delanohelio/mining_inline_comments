However, **the cluster version is not open sourced**.\n+  * OpenTSDB uses LGPL2.1, which **is not compatible with Apache License**.\n+  * KairosDB uses Apache License 2.0.\n+  * TimescaleDB uses Timescale License, which is not free for enterprise. \n+\n+* SQL like: \n+\n+  * IoTDB and InfluxDB supports SQL like language. Besides, The integration of IoTDB and Calcite is alomost done (a PR has been submitted), which means IoTDB will support Standard SQL.\n+  * OpenTSDB and KairosDB only support Rest API. Besides, IoTDB also supports Rest API (a PR has been submitted).\n+  * TimescaleDB uses the SQL the same with PG.\n+  \n+* Schema:\n+\n+  * IoTDB: IoTDB proposes a [Tree based schema](http://iotdb.apache.org/UserGuide/Master/2-Concept/1-Data%20Model%20and%20Terminology.html#data-model-and-terminology). \n+   It is quite different with other TSDBs. However, the kind of schema has the following advantages:\n+    \n+    * In many industrial scenarios, the management of devices are hierarchical, rather than flat.\n+    That is why we think a tree based schema is better than tag-value based schema.\n+    \n+    * In many real world applications, tag names are constant. For example, a wind turbine manufacturer\n+    always identify their wind turbines by which country it locates, the farm name it belongs to, and it ID in the farm.\n+    So, a 4-depth tree (\"root.the-country.the-farm.the-id\") is fine. \n+    You do not need to repeat to tell IoTDB the 2nd level of the tree is for country name, \n+    the 3rd level is for farm id, etc..\n+    \n+    * A path based time series ID definition also supports flexible queries, like \"root.\\*.a.b.\\*\", wehre \\* is wildcard character.\n+  \n+  * InfluxDB, KairosDB, OpenTSDB are tag-value based, which is more popular currently.\n+  \n+  * TimescaleDB uses relational table.   \n+\n+* Order by time:\n+  \n+  Order by time seems quite trivil for time series database. But... if we consider another featuer, called align by time,\n+  something becomes interesting.  And, that is why we mark OpenTSDB and KairosDB unsupported.\n+  \n+  Actually, in each time series, all these TSDBs support order data by timestamps.\n+  \n+  However, OpenTSDB and KairosDB do not support order the data from different timeseries in the time order.\n+  \n+  Ok, considering a new case: I have two time series, one is for the wind speed in wind farm1, \n+  another is for the generated energy of wind turbine1 in farm1. If we want to analyze the relation between the \n+  wind speed and the generated energy, we have to know the values of both at the same time.\n+  That is to say, we have to align the two time series in the time dimension.\n+  \n+  So, the result should be:\n+  \n+  | timestamp |  wind speed | generated energy |\n+  |-----------|-------------|------------------|\n+  |    1      |     5.0     |         13.1     |\n+  |    2      |     6.0     |         13.3     |\n+  |    3      |     null    |         13.1     |\n+  \n+  or,\n+  \n+    | timestamp |     series name   |    value   |\n+    |-----------|-------------------|------------|\n+    |    1      |       wind speed  |    5.0     |\n+    |    1      | generated energy  |    13.1    |\n+    |    2      |       wind speed  |    6.0     |\n+    |    2      | generated energy  |    13.3    |\n+    |    3      | generated energy  |    13.1    |      \n+  \n+ Though the second table format does not algin data by the time dimension, but it is easy to be implemented in the client-side,\n+ by justing scanning data row by row.\n+ \n+ IoTDB supports the first table format (called align by time), InfluxDB supports the second table format.\n+\n+* Downsampling:\n+\n+  Downsampling is for changing the granularity of timeseries, e.g., from 10Hz to 1Hz, or 1 point per day.\n+  \n+  Different with other systems, IoTDB downsamples data in real time, while others serialized downsampled data on disk.      \n+  That is to say,\n+  \n+  * IoTDB supports **adhoc** downsampling data in **arbitrary time**. \n+  e.g., a SQL returns 1 point per 5 minutes and start with 2020-04-27 08:00:00 while another SQL returns 1 point per 5 minutes + 10 seconds and start with 2020-04-27 08:00:01.\n+  \uff08InfluxDB also supports adhoc downsampling but the performance is ..... hm)\n+  \n+  * There is no disk loss for IoTDB.\n+  \n+\n+* Fill:\n+\n+  Sometimes we thought the data is collected in some fixed frequency, e.g., 1Hz (1 point per second). \n+  But usually, we may lost some data points, because the network is unstalbe, the machine is busy, or the machine is down for several minutes.\n+  \n+  In this case, filling these holes is important. Data scientists can avoid to many so called dirty work, e.g., data clean.\n+  \n+  InfluxDB and OpenTSDB only support using fill in a group by statement, while IoTDB supports to fill data when just given a particular timestamp.\n+  Besides, IoTDB supports several strategies for filling data.\n+       \n+* Slimit:\n+\n+  Slimit means return limited number of measurements (or, fields in InfluxDB). \n+  For example, a wind turbine may have 1000 measurements (speed, voltage, etc..), using slimit and soffset can just return a part of them.    \n+  \n+\n+* Latest value:\n+\n+  As one of the most basic timeseries based applications is monitoring the latest data. \n+  Therefore, a query to return the latest value of a time series is very important.\n+  IoTDB and OpenTSDB support that with a special SQL or API,\n+  while InfluxDB supports that using an aggregation function.\n+  (the reason why IoTDB porvides a special SQL is IoTDB optimizes the query expressly.)\n+  \n+   \n+  \n+**Conclusion**:\n+\n+Well, if we compare the basic features, we can find that OpenTSDB and KairosDB somehow lack some important query features.\n+TimescaleDB can not be freely used in business.\n+IoTDB and InfluxDB can meet most requirements of time series data management, while they have some difference.\n+\n+\n+#### Advanced Features\n+\n+I listed some interesting features that these systems may differ.\n+\n+| TSDB                        | IoTDB                           | InfluxDB   | OpenTSDB   | KairosDB   | TimescaleDB |   \n+|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|-------------|   \n+| Align by time               | **O**                           | o          | x          | x          | o           |   \n+| Compression                 | **O**                           | :\\-(       | :\\-\\(      | :\\-\\(      | :\\-\\(       |   \n+| MQTT support                | **O**                           | o          | x          | x          | :\\-\\(       |   \n+| Run on Edge-side Device     | **O**                           | o          | x          | :\\-\\(      | o           |   \n+| Multi\\-instance Sync        | **O**                           | x          | x          | x          | x           |   \n+| JDBC Driver                 | **o**                           | x          | x          | x          | x           |   \n+| Standard SQL                | o                               | x          | x          | x          | **O**       |   \n+| Spark integration           | **O**                           | x          | x          | x          | x           | ", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "1aa8114ea58a90286f5c3cc41bea2c1324dcc4de"}, "originalPosition": 222}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDA5MDM0NjY3", "url": "https://github.com/apache/iotdb/pull/1189#pullrequestreview-409034667", "createdAt": "2020-05-11T10:05:38Z", "commit": {"oid": "1aa8114ea58a90286f5c3cc41bea2c1324dcc4de"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 3, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNS0xMVQxMDowNTozOFrOGTVk3g==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNS0xMVQxMDoxMzoyOFrOGTV1_g==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyMjkyOTYzMA==", "bodyText": "OpenSource", "url": "https://github.com/apache/iotdb/pull/1189#discussion_r422929630", "createdAt": "2020-05-11T10:05:38Z", "author": {"login": "liutaohua"}, "path": "docs/UserGuide/9-Comparison/TSDB-Comparison.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,400 @@\n+<!--\n+\n+    Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\n+    or more contributor license agreements.

Data scientists can avoid to many so called dirty work, e.g., data clean.\n+  \n+  InfluxDB and OpenTSDB only support using fill in a group by statement, while IoTDB supports to fill data when just given a particular timestamp.\n+  Besides, IoTDB supports several strategies for filling data.\n+       \n+* Slimit:\n+\n+  Slimit means return limited number of measurements (or, fields in InfluxDB). \n+  For example, a wind turbine may have 1000 measurements (speed, voltage, etc..), using slimit and soffset can just return a part of them.    \n+  \n+\n+* Latest value:\n+\n+  As one of the most basic timeseries based applications is monitoring the latest data. \n+  Therefore, a query to return the latest value of a time series is very important.\n+  IoTDB and OpenTSDB support that with a special SQL or API,\n+  while InfluxDB supports that using an aggregation function.\n+  (the reason why IoTDB porvides a special SQL is IoTDB optimizes the query expressly.)\n+  \n+   \n+  \n+**Conclusion**:\n+\n+Well, if we compare the basic features, we can find that OpenTSDB and KairosDB somehow lack some important query features.\n+TimescaleDB can not be freely used in business.\n+IoTDB and InfluxDB can meet most requirements of time series data management, while they have some difference.\n+\n+\n+#### Advanced Features\n+\n+I listed some interesting features that these systems may differ.\n+\n+| TSDB                        | IoTDB                           | InfluxDB   | OpenTSDB   | KairosDB   | TimescaleDB |   \n+|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|-------------|   \n+| Align by time               | **O**                           | o          | x          | x          | o           |   \n+| Compression                 | **O**                           | :\\-(       | :\\-\\(      | :\\-\\(      | :\\-\\(       |   \n+| MQTT support                | **O**                           | o          | x          | x          | :\\-\\(       |   \n+| Run on Edge-side Device     | **O**                           | o          | x          | :\\-\\(      | o           |   \n+| Multi\\-instance Sync        | **O**                           | x          | x          | x          | x           |   \n+| JDBC Driver                 | **o**                           | x          | x          | x          | x           |   \n+| Standard SQL                | o                               | x          | x          | x          | **O**       |   \n+| Spark integration           | **O**                           | x          | x          | x          | x           | \n+| Hive integration            | **O**                           | x          | x          | x          | x           |\n+| Writing data to NFS (HDFS)  | **O**                           | x          | o          | x          | x           |\n+\n+\n+* Align by time: have been introduced. Let's skip it..\n+\n+* Compression: \n+  * IoTDB supports many encoding and compression for time series, like RLE, 2DIFF, Gorilla, etc.. and Snappy compression.\n+  In IoTDB, you can choose which encoding method you want, according to the data distribution. For more info, see [here](http://iotdb.apache.org/UserGuide/Master/2-Concept/3-Encoding.html).\n+  * InfluxDB also supports encoding and compression, but you can not define which encoding method you want.\n+  It just depends on the data type. For more info, see [here](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/storage_engine/).\n+  * OpenTSDB and KairosDB use HBase and Cassandra in backend, and have no special encoding for time series.\n+  \n+* MQTT protocol support:\n+  \n+  MQTT protocol is an international standard and widely known in industrial users. only IoTDB and InfluxDB support user using MQTT client to write data.  \n+\n+* Running on Edge-side Device:\n+  \n+  Nowdays, edge computing is more and more popular, which means the edge device has more powerful compution resources. \n+  Deploying a TSDB on the edge side is useful for managing data on the edge side and serve for edge computing. \n+  As OpenTSDB and KairosDB rely another DB, the architecture is a little heavy. Especially, it is hard to run Hadoop on the edge side.\n+\n+* Multi-instance Sync:\n+  \n+  Ok, now we have many TSDB instances on the edge-side. Then, how to upload their data to the data center, to form a ... data lake (or ocean, river,..., whatever).\n+  One choice is read data from these instances and write the data point by point to the data center instance.\n+  IoTDB provides another choice, just uploading the data file into the data center incrementally, then the data center can support service on the data. \n+  \n+* JDBC driver:\n+\n+  Now only IoTDB supports a JDBC driver (though not all interfaces are implemented), and makes it possible to integrate many other JDBC drvier based softwares.\n+\n+* Standard SQL:\n+\n+  As mentioned, the integration of IoTDB and Calcite is alomost done (a PR has been submitted), which means IoTDB will support Standard SQL.\n+  \n+* Spark and Hive integration:\n+\n+  It is very very important that letting big data analysis software to access the data in database for more complex data analysis.\n+  IoTDB supports Hive-connector and Spark connector for better integration. \n+\n+*  Writing data to NFS (HDFS):\n+  Sharing nothing architecture is good, but sometimes you have to add new servers even your CPU and memory is idle but the disk is full...\n+  Besides, if we can save the data file directly to HDFS, it will be more easy to use Spark and other softwares to analyze data, without ETL.\n+  \n+  * IoTDB supports write data locally or on HDFS directly. IoTDB also allows user extend to store data on other NFS.\n+  * InfluxDB, KairosDB have to write data locally.\n+  * OpenTSDB has to write data on HDFS.\n+    \n+**Conclusion**:    \n+  \n+  We can find that IoTDB has many interesting features that other TSDBs do not support.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "1aa8114ea58a90286f5c3cc41bea2c1324dcc4de"}, "originalPosition": 275}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "25661b6378a9571fbe8cf15d99fd525f698cd63b", "author": {"user": {"login": "qiaojialin", "name": "Jialin Qiao"}}, "url": "https://github.com/apache/iotdb/commit/25661b6378a9571fbe8cf15d99fd525f698cd63b", "committedDate": "2020-05-12T03:51:49Z", "message": "add flink and fix typo"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDIwNzA3ODYy", "url": "https://github.com/apache/iotdb/pull/1189#pullrequestreview-420707862", "createdAt": "2020-05-29T07:18:23Z", "commit": {"oid": "25661b6378a9571fbe8cf15d99fd525f698cd63b"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNS0yOVQwNzoxODoyM1rOGcRcJg==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNS0yOVQwNzoxODoyM1rOGcRcJg==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzMjI5OTA0Ng==", "bodyText": "Please update the URL...

However, **the cluster version is not open sourced**.\n+  * OpenTSDB uses LGPL2.1, which **is not compatible with Apache License**.\n+  * KairosDB uses Apache License 2.0.\n+  * TimescaleDB uses Timescale License, which is not free for enterprise. \n+\n+* SQL like: \n+\n+  * IoTDB and InfluxDB supports SQL like language. Besides, The integration of IoTDB and Calcite is alomost done (a PR has been submitted), which means IoTDB will support Standard SQL.\n+  * OpenTSDB and KairosDB only support Rest API. Besides, IoTDB also supports Rest API (a PR has been submitted).\n+  * TimescaleDB uses the SQL the same with PG.\n+  \n+* Schema:\n+\n+  * IoTDB: IoTDB proposes a [Tree based schema](http://iotdb.apache.org/UserGuide/Master/2-Concept/1-Data%20Model%20and%20Terminology.html#data-model-and-terminology). \n+   It is quite different with other TSDBs. However, the kind of schema has the following advantages:\n+    \n+    * In many industrial scenarios, the management of devices are hierarchical, rather than flat.\n+    That is why we think a tree based schema is better than tag-value based schema.\n+    \n+    * In many real world applications, tag names are constant. For example, a wind turbine manufacturer\n+    always identify their wind turbines by which country it locates, the farm name it belongs to, and it ID in the farm.\n+    So, a 4-depth tree (\"root.the-country.the-farm.the-id\") is fine. \n+    You do not need to repeat to tell IoTDB the 2nd level of the tree is for country name, \n+    the 3rd level is for farm id, etc..\n+    \n+    * A path based time series ID definition also supports flexible queries, like \"root.\\*.a.b.\\*\", wehre \\* is wildcard character.\n+  \n+  * InfluxDB, KairosDB, OpenTSDB are tag-value based, which is more popular currently.\n+  \n+  * TimescaleDB uses relational table.   \n+\n+* Order by time:\n+  \n+  Order by time seems quite trivil for time series database. But... if we consider another featuer, called align by time,\n+  something becomes interesting.  And, that is why we mark OpenTSDB and KairosDB unsupported.\n+  \n+  Actually, in each time series, all these TSDBs support order data by timestamps.\n+  \n+  However, OpenTSDB and KairosDB do not support order the data from different timeseries in the time order.\n+  \n+  Ok, considering a new case: I have two time series, one is for the wind speed in wind farm1, \n+  another is for the generated energy of wind turbine1 in farm1. If we want to analyze the relation between the \n+  wind speed and the generated energy, we have to know the values of both at the same time.\n+  That is to say, we have to align the two time series in the time dimension.\n+  \n+  So, the result should be:\n+  \n+  | timestamp |  wind speed | generated energy |\n+  |-----------|-------------|------------------|\n+  |    1      |     5.0     |         13.1     |\n+  |    2      |     6.0     |         13.3     |\n+  |    3      |     null    |         13.1     |\n+  \n+  or,\n+  \n+    | timestamp |     series name   |    value   |\n+    |-----------|-------------------|------------|\n+    |    1      |       wind speed  |    5.0     |\n+    |    1      | generated energy  |    13.1    |\n+    |    2      |       wind speed  |    6.0     |\n+    |    2      | generated energy  |    13.3    |\n+    |    3      | generated energy  |    13.1    |      \n+  \n+ Though the second table format does not align data by the time dimension, but it is easy to be implemented in the client-side,\n+ by just scanning data row by row.\n+ \n+ IoTDB supports the first table format (called align by time), InfluxDB supports the second table format.\n+\n+* Downsampling:\n+\n+  Downsampling is for changing the granularity of timeseries, e.g., from 10Hz to 1Hz, or 1 point per day.\n+  \n+  Different with other systems, IoTDB downsamples data in real time, while others serialized downsampled data on disk.      \n+  That is to say,\n+  \n+  * IoTDB supports **adhoc** downsampling data in **arbitrary time**. \n+  e.g., a SQL returns 1 point per 5 minutes and start with 2020-04-27 08:00:00 while another SQL returns 1 point per 5 minutes + 10 seconds and start with 2020-04-27 08:00:01.\n+  \uff08InfluxDB also supports adhoc downsampling but the performance is ..... hm)\n+  \n+  * There is no disk loss for IoTDB.\n+  \n+\n+* Fill:\n+\n+  Sometimes we thought the data is collected in some fixed frequency, e.g., 1Hz (1 point per second). \n+  But usually, we may lost some data points, because the network is unstable, the machine is busy, or the machine is down for several minutes.\n+  \n+  In this case, filling these holes is important. Data scientists can avoid to many so called dirty work, e.g., data clean.\n+  \n+  InfluxDB and OpenTSDB only support using fill in a group by statement, while IoTDB supports to fill data when just given a particular timestamp.\n+  Besides, IoTDB supports several strategies for filling data.\n+       \n+* Slimit:\n+\n+  Slimit means return limited number of measurements (or, fields in InfluxDB). \n+  For example, a wind turbine may have 1000 measurements (speed, voltage, etc..), using slimit and soffset can just return a part of them.    \n+  \n+\n+* Latest value:\n+\n+  As one of the most basic timeseries based applications is monitoring the latest data. \n+  Therefore, a query to return the latest value of a time series is very important.\n+  IoTDB and OpenTSDB support that with a special SQL or API,\n+  while InfluxDB supports that using an aggregation function.\n+  (the reason why IoTDB provides a special SQL is IoTDB optimizes the query expressly.)\n+  \n+   \n+  \n+**Conclusion**:\n+\n+Well, if we compare the basic features, we can find that OpenTSDB and KairosDB somehow lack some important query features.\n+TimescaleDB can not be freely used in business.\n+IoTDB and InfluxDB can meet most requirements of time series data management, while they have some difference.\n+\n+\n+#### Advanced Features\n+\n+I listed some interesting features that these systems may differ.\n+\n+| TSDB                        | IoTDB                           | InfluxDB   | OpenTSDB   | KairosDB   | TimescaleDB |   \n+|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|-------------|   \n+| Align by time               | **O**                           | o          | x          | x          | o           |   \n+| Compression                 | **O**                           | :\\-(       | :\\-\\(      | :\\-\\(      | :\\-\\(       |   \n+| MQTT support                | **O**                           | o          | x          | x          | :\\-\\(       |   \n+| Run on Edge-side Device     | **O**                           | o          | x          | :\\-\\(      | o           |   \n+| Multi\\-instance Sync        | **O**                           | x          | x          | x          | x           |   \n+| JDBC Driver                 | **o**                           | x          | x          | x          | x           |   \n+| Standard SQL                | o                               | x          | x          | x          | **O**       |   \n+| Spark integration           | **O**                           | x          | x          | x          | x           | \n+| Hive integration            | **O**                           | x          | x          | x          | x           |\n+| Writing data to NFS (HDFS)  | **O**                           | x          | o          | x          | x           |\n+| Flink integration           | **O**                           | x          | x          | x          | x           |\n+\n+\n+* Align by time: have been introduced.
