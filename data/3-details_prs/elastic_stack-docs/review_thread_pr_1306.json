This page describes the end-to-end workflow to clarify how you can \n+train a model and deploy it to answer the right questions and solve your \n+problem. It gives a high-level overview of the steps required to identify and \n+implement a solution to a problem using supervised learning.\n+\n+The workflow for supervised learning consists of the following stages:\n+\n+* Define the problem\n+* Prepare and transform data\n+* Train and test the model\n+* Deploy the model\n+\n+[DIAGRAM]\n+\n+These are iterative stages, meaning that after evaluating each step, you might \n+need to make adjustments before you move further.\n+\n+\n+[[define-problem]]\n+== Define the problem\n+\n+It\u2019s important to take a moment and think about where {ml} can be most \n+impactful. Consider what type of data you have available and what value it \n+holds. What business problems do you want to solve by analyzing this data? The \n+better you know the data, the quicker you will be able to create {ml} models \n+that generate useful insights. It is crucial to think through the problem and \n+set clear objectives. Find the answer to questions like these: What kinds of \n+patterns do you want to discover in your data? What type of value do you want to \n+predict: a category, or a numerical value? The answers help you choose the type \n+of analysis that fits your use case.\n+\n+After you identify the problem, consider which of the {ml-features} are most \n+likely to help you solve it. Unsupervised learning \u2013 like {anomaly-detect} or \n+{oldetection} \u2013 does not require a labelled data set to train the model on while \n+supervised learning requires a data set that contains the known values or \n+examples that the model can be trained on.\n+\n+{stack} provides the following types of supervised learning: \n+\n+* {regression}: predicts **continuous, numerical values** like the response time \n+  of a web request. \n+* {classification}: predicts **discrete, categorical values** like whether a \n+  https://www.elastic.co/blog/machine-learning-in-cybersecurity-training-supervised-models-to-detect-dga-activity[DNS request originates from a malicious or benign domain]. \n+\n+\n+[[prepare-transform-data]]\n+== Prepare and transform data\n+\n+You have defined the problem and selected an appropriate type of analysis. The \n+next step is to produce a high-quality data set in {es} with a clear \n+relationship to your training objectives. If your data is not already in {es} or \n+you are not collecting all of the necessary information, this is the stage where \n+you develop your data pipeline. If you want to learn more about how to ingest \n+data into {es}, refer to the {ref}/ingest.html[documentation].\n+\n+{classification-cap} and {regression} are supervised {ml} techniques, therefore \n+you must \n+supply a labelled data set for training. This is often called the \"ground truth\" \n+as it consists of the observed examples on which you can train the model. The \n+\"ground truth\" allows the training process to identify relationships among the \n+various characteristics of the data and the predicted value as well as takes a \n+critical role in model evaluation.\n+\n+An important requirement is a data set that is large enough to train a model. \n+For example, if you would like to train a {classification} model that decides \n+whether an email is a spam or not, you need a labelled data set that contains \n+enough data points from each possible category to train the model. What counts \n+as \"enough\" depends on various factors like the complexity of the problem or \n+the {ml} solution you have chosen. There is no exact number that fits every \n+use case; deciding how much data is acceptable is rather a heuristic process \n+that might involve iterative trials.\n+\n+Before you train the model, consider preprocessing the data. In practice, the \n+type of preprocessing depends on the nature of the data set. Preprocessing can \n+include, but is not limited to, mitigating redundancy, reducing biases, applying \n+standards and/or conventions, data normalization, and so on.\n+\n+{regression-cap} and {classification} requires specifically structured source \n+data: a two dimensional tabular data structure. For this reason, you might need \n+to {ref}/transforms.html[{transform}] your data to create a {dataframe} which \n+can be used as the source for {dfanalytics} like {regression} and \n+{classification}.\n+\n+[[train-test-iterate]]\n+== Train, test, iterate\n+\n+After your data is prepared and transformed into the right format, it is time to \n+train the model. Training is an iterative process \u2014 every round of iteration is \n+followed by an evaluation to see how the model performs. When you are satisfied \n+with the results, you are ready to deploy the model otherwise you may want to \n+adjust the training configuration or consider alternative ways to preprocess and \n+represent your data.\n+\n+The first step is defining the features \u2013 the relevant fields in the data set \u2013 \n+that will be used for training the model. By default, all the fields with \n+supported types are included in classification and regression automatically. \n+However, you can exclude irrelevant fields optionally from the process. Doing so \n+makes a large dataset more manageable and by reducing the computing resources \n+and time required for training.\n+\n+Now define how to split your training data, using what's called the train-test \n+split. There is no optimal percentage that fits for all use cases, it depends on \n+the amount of data and the time you have to train. The test set won\u2019t be used to \n+train the model, but only for testing during the learning process.\n+\n+During the training process, the training data that contains the ground truth \n+you want to learn from is fed through the learning algorithm. The model predicts \n+the value and compares it to the ground truth then the model is fine-tuned to \n+make the predictions more accurate.\n+\n+Once the model has been trained, it will be tested on  how well it predicts for \n+previously unseen data. This test provides an estimate of a quantity known as \n+the model generalization error. There are further evaluation types for both \n+{classification} and {regression} analysis which provide metrics about training \n+performance. \n+\n+\n+[[deploy-model]]\n+== Deploy model\n+\n+You have trained the model and are satisfied with the performance. The last step \n+is to deploy your trained model and start using it on new data.\n+\n+Trained models are stored as {es} documents in an internal index.

Consider what type of data you have available and what value it \n+holds. What business problems do you want to solve by analyzing this data? The \n+better you know the data, the quicker you will be able to create {ml} models \n+that generate useful insights. It is crucial to think through the problem and \n+set clear objectives. Find the answer to questions like these: What kinds of \n+patterns do you want to discover in your data? What type of value do you want to \n+predict: a category, or a numerical value? The answers help you choose the type \n+of analysis that fits your use case.\n+\n+After you identify the problem, consider which of the {ml-features} are most \n+likely to help you solve it. Unsupervised learning \u2013 like {anomaly-detect} or \n+{oldetection} \u2013 does not require a labelled data set to train the model on while \n+supervised learning requires a data set that contains the known values or \n+examples that the model can be trained on.\n+\n+{stack} provides the following types of supervised learning: \n+\n+* {regression}: predicts **continuous, numerical values** like the response time \n+  of a web request. \n+* {classification}: predicts **discrete, categorical values** like whether a \n+  https://www.elastic.co/blog/machine-learning-in-cybersecurity-training-supervised-models-to-detect-dga-activity[DNS request originates from a malicious or benign domain]. \n+\n+\n+[[prepare-transform-data]]\n+== Prepare and transform data\n+\n+You have defined the problem and selected an appropriate type of analysis. The \n+next step is to produce a high-quality data set in {es} with a clear \n+relationship to your training objectives. If your data is not already in {es} or \n+you are not collecting all of the necessary information, this is the stage where \n+you develop your data pipeline. If you want to learn more about how to ingest \n+data into {es}, refer to the {ref}/ingest.html[documentation].\n+\n+{classification-cap} and {regression} are supervised {ml} techniques, therefore \n+you must \n+supply a labelled data set for training. This is often called the \"ground truth\" \n+as it consists of the observed examples on which you can train the model. The \n+\"ground truth\" allows the training process to identify relationships among the \n+various characteristics of the data and the predicted value as well as takes a \n+critical role in model evaluation.\n+\n+An important requirement is a data set that is large enough to train a model. \n+For example, if you would like to train a {classification} model that decides \n+whether an email is a spam or not, you need a labelled data set that contains \n+enough data points from each possible category to train the model. What counts \n+as \"enough\" depends on various factors like the complexity of the problem or \n+the {ml} solution you have chosen. There is no exact number that fits every \n+use case; deciding how much data is acceptable is rather a heuristic process \n+that might involve iterative trials.\n+\n+Before you train the model, consider preprocessing the data. In practice, the \n+type of preprocessing depends on the nature of the data set. Preprocessing can \n+include, but is not limited to, mitigating redundancy, reducing biases, applying \n+standards and/or conventions, data normalization, and so on.\n+\n+{regression-cap} and {classification} requires specifically structured source \n+data: a two dimensional tabular data structure. For this reason, you might need \n+to {ref}/transforms.html[{transform}] your data to create a {dataframe} which \n+can be used as the source for {dfanalytics} like {regression} and \n+{classification}.\n+\n+[[train-test-iterate]]\n+== Train, test, iterate\n+\n+After your data is prepared and transformed into the right format, it is time to \n+train the model. Training is an iterative process \u2014 every round of iteration is \n+followed by an evaluation to see how the model performs. When you are satisfied \n+with the results, you are ready to deploy the model otherwise you may want to \n+adjust the training configuration or consider alternative ways to preprocess and \n+represent your data.\n+\n+The first step is defining the features \u2013 the relevant fields in the data set \u2013 \n+that will be used for training the model. By default, all the fields with \n+supported types are included in classification and regression automatically. \n+However, you can exclude irrelevant fields optionally from the process. Doing so \n+makes a large dataset more manageable and by reducing the computing resources \n+and time required for training.\n+\n+Now define how to split your training data, using what's called the train-test \n+split. There is no optimal percentage that fits for all use cases, it depends on \n+the amount of data and the time you have to train. The test set won\u2019t be used to \n+train the model, but only for testing during the learning process.\n+\n+During the training process, the training data that contains the ground truth \n+you want to learn from is fed through the learning algorithm. The model predicts \n+the value and compares it to the ground truth then the model is fine-tuned to \n+make the predictions more accurate.\n+\n+Once the model has been trained, it will be tested on  how well it predicts for \n+previously unseen data. This test provides an estimate of a quantity known as \n+the model generalization error. There are further evaluation types for both \n+{classification} and {regression} analysis which provide metrics about training \n+performance. \n+\n+\n+[[deploy-model]]\n+== Deploy model\n+\n+You have trained the model and are satisfied with the performance. The last step \n+is to deploy your trained model and start using it on new data.\n+\n+Trained models are stored as {es} documents in an internal index. The Elastic \n+{ml} feature called {infer} enables you to use the model in a continuous fashion \n+either by using it as a processor in an ingest pipeline, in a continuous \n+{transform} or as an aggregation at search time. When new data comes into your \n+ingest pipeline or you run a search on your data with an {infer} aggregation, \n+the model is used to infer against the data and make predictions on it.\n+\n+\n+[[next-steps]]\n+== Next steps\n+\n+* Read more about how to {ref}/transforms.html[transform you data] into an \n+  entity-centric index.\n+* Consult the documentation to learn more about <<dfa-regression>> and \n+  <<dfa-classification>>.\n+* Learn how to evaluate <<ml-dfanalytics-classification,classification>> and \n+  <<ml-dfanalytics-regression-evaluation,regression>> models.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "464be52559693925bd1d16780c3f5116f5e46f8b"}, "originalPosition": 146}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMjg4NTgxMjc3OnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "docs/en/stack/ml/df-analytics/ml-supervised-workflow.asciidoc", "isResolved": true, "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNy0yOVQxMTozMTo0NVrOG40UOQ==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNy0yOVQxMTozMTo0NVrOG40UOQ==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2MjIzMDU4NQ==", "bodyText": "This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

You can then use your model to make predictions on \n+new data. This page describes the end-to-end workflow to clarify how you can \n+train a model, evaluate it and deploy it. It gives a high-level overview of the \n+steps required to identify and implement a solution using supervised learning.\n+\n+The workflow for supervised learning consists of the following stages:\n+\n+image::images/ml-dfa-lifecycle-diagram.png[\"Supervised learning workflow\"]\n+\n+These are iterative stages, meaning that after evaluating each step, you might \n+need to make adjustments before you move further.\n+\n+\n+[[define-problem]]\n+== Define the problem\n+\n+It\u2019s important to take a moment and think about where {ml} can be most \n+impactful. Consider what type of data you have available and what value it \n+holds. The better you know the data, the quicker you will be able to create {ml} \n+models that generate useful insights. What kinds of patterns do you want to \n+discover in your data? What type of value do you want to predict: a category, or \n+a numerical value? The answers help you choose the type of analysis that fits \n+your use case.\n+\n+After you identify the problem, consider which of the {ml-features} are most \n+likely to help you solve it. Unsupervised learning \u2013 like {anomaly-detect} or \n+{oldetection} \u2013 does not require a labelled data set to train the model on while \n+supervised learning requires a data set that contains the known values that the \n+model can be trained on.\n+\n+{stack} provides the following types of supervised learning: \n+\n+* {regression}: predicts **continuous, numerical values** like the response time \n+  of a web request. \n+* {classification}: predicts **discrete, categorical values** like whether a \n+  https://www.elastic.co/blog/machine-learning-in-cybersecurity-training-supervised-models-to-detect-dga-activity[DNS request originates from a malicious or benign domain]. \n+\n+\n+[[prepare-transform-data]]\n+== Prepare and transform data\n+\n+You have defined the problem and selected an appropriate type of analysis. The \n+next step is to produce a high-quality data set in {es} with a clear \n+relationship to your training objectives. If your data is not already in {es}, \n+this is the stage where you develop your data pipeline. If you want to learn \n+more about how to ingest data into {es}, refer to the \n+{ref}/ingest.html[documentation].\n+\n+{regression-cap} and {classification} are supervised {ml} techniques, therefore \n+you must supply a labelled data set for training. This is often called the \n+\"ground truth\". The \"ground truth\" allows the training process to identify \n+relationships among the various characteristics of the data and the predicted \n+value as well as takes a critical role in model evaluation.\n+\n+An important requirement is a data set that is large enough to train a model. \n+For example, if you would like to train a {classification} model that decides \n+whether an email is a spam or not, you need a labelled data set that contains \n+enough data points from each possible category to train the model. What counts \n+as \"enough\" depends on various factors like the complexity of the problem or \n+the {ml} solution you have chosen. There is no exact number that fits every \n+use case; deciding how much data is acceptable is rather a heuristic process \n+that might involve iterative trials.\n+\n+Before you train the model, consider preprocessing the data. In practice, the \n+type of preprocessing depends on the nature of the data set. Preprocessing can \n+include, but is not limited to, mitigating redundancy, reducing biases, applying \n+standards and/or conventions, data normalization, and so on.\n+\n+{regression-cap} and {classification} requires specifically structured source \n+data: a two dimensional tabular data structure. For this reason, you might need \n+to {ref}/transforms.html[{transform}] your data to create a {dataframe} which \n+can be used as the source for {dfanalytics} like {regression} and \n+{classification}.\n+\n+[[train-test-iterate]]\n+== Train, test, iterate\n+\n+After your data is prepared and transformed into the right format, it is time to \n+train the model. Training is an iterative process \u2014 every iteration is followed \n+by an evaluation to see how the model performs. When you are satisfied with the \n+results, you are ready to deploy the model otherwise you may want to adjust the \n+training configuration or consider alternative ways to preprocess and represent \n+your data.\n+\n+The first step is defining the features \u2013 the relevant fields in the data set \u2013 \n+that will be used for training the model. By default, all the fields with \n+supported types are included in {regression} and {classification} automatically. \n+However, you can exclude irrelevant fields optionally from the process. Doing so \n+makes a large dataset more manageable, reducing the computing resources and time \n+required for training.\n+\n+Now define how to split your data into a training and a test set. The test set \n+won\u2019t be used to train the model, but is used to evaluate how the model \n+performs. There is no optimal percentage that fits all use cases, it depends on \n+the amount of data and the time you have to train. For large data sets, you may \n+want to start with a low training percent to complete an end-to-end iteration in \n+a short time.\n+\n+During the training process, the training data that contains the ground truth \n+you want to learn from is fed through the learning algorithm. The model predicts \n+the value and compares it to the ground truth then the model is fine-tuned to \n+make the predictions more accurate.\n+\n+Once the model has been trained, it will be tested on how well it predicts for \n+previously unseen data. This test provides an estimate of a quantity known as \n+the model generalization error. There are further \n+<<ml-dfanalytics-evaluate,evaluation types>> for both {regression} and \n+{classification} analysis which provide metrics about training performance. \n+Depending on the evaluation results, you may wish to iterate.\n+\n+\n+[[deploy-model]]\n+== Deploy model\n+\n+You have trained the model and are satisfied with the performance. The last step \n+is to deploy your trained model and start using it on new data.\n+\n+The Elastic {ml} feature called {infer} enables you to make predictions for new \n+data either by using it as a processor in an ingest pipeline, in a continuous \n+{transform} or as an aggregation at search time. When new data comes into your \n+ingest pipeline or you run a search on your data with an {infer} aggregation, \n+the model is used to infer against the data and make predictions on it.\n+\n+\n+[[next-steps]]\n+== Next steps\n+\n+* Read more about how to {ref}/transforms.html[transform you data] into an \n+  entity-centric index.\n+* Consult the documentation to learn more about <<dfa-regression,regression>> \n+  and <<dfa-classification,classification>>.\n+* Learn how to evaluate <<ml-dfanalytics-regression-evaluation,regression>> and \n+  <<ml-dfanalytics-classification,classification>> models.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "1c30df500343227726f05f8919e447aab08f6bfb"}, "originalPosition": 138}]}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 1437, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-12T13:16:51Z"}}}
