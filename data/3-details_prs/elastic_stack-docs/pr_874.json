For example, `and not process.name : \"process-name\"`.\n+* Add a statement or filter to the rules that exclude a common user. \n+For example, `and not user.name : \"security-tester\"`.\n+\n+Another useful technique is to assign lower risk scores to rules triggered by \n+authorized activity.

Exceptions could result in an undetected client side execution, or \n+a persistence or malware threat going unnoticed.\n+\n+Examples of when these rules may create noise include:\n+\n+* Receiving and opening email-attached Microsoft Office files, which \n+include active content such as macros or scripts, from a trusted third-party \n+source.\n+* Authorized technical support personnel who provide remote workers with\n+scripts to gather troubleshooting information.\n+\n+In these cases, exceptions can be added to the rules using the relevant \n+`process.name`, `user.name`, and `host.name` conditions.

When normal network activity triggers signals, \n+network rules can be disabled or modified. For example:\n+\n+* To exclude a specific source, add a `not source.ip` statement with the \n+relevant IP address, and a `destination.port` statement with the relevant port \n+number (`not source.ip : 196.1.0.12 and destination.port : 445`).\n+* To exclude source network traffic for an entire subnet, add a `not source.ip` \n+statement with the relevant CIDR notation (`not source.ip : 192.168.0.0/16`).\n+* To exclude a destination IP for a specific destination port, add a\n+`not destination.ip` statement with the IP address, and a `destination.port` \n+statement with the port number\n+(`not destination.ip : 38.160.150.31 and destination.port : 445`)\n+* To exclude a destination subnet for a specific destination port, add a\n+`not destination.ip` statement using CIDR notation, and a \u2018destination.port\u2019 \n+statement with the port number\n+(`not destination.ip : 172.16.0.0/12 and destination.port : 445`).\n+\n+[float]\n+==== Noise from common network traffic\n+\n+These network rules may need tuning to reduce noise from legitimate network\n+activity:\n+\n+[horizontal]\n+<<dns-activity-to-the-internet>>:: Personal devices, brought to work or used while working remotely, can query arbitrary DNS servers.\n+<<ftp-file-transfer-protocol-activity-to-the-internet>>:: FTP is sometimes used with external sources.\n+<<smtp-to-the-internet>>:: Marketing and business workflows often \n+use SMTP email traffic.

These legitimate \n+activities include:\n+\n+* Ongoing and automated security testing and research.\n+* System and software management processes running scripts, including scripts \n+that start child processes.\n+* Administrative and management frameworks that create users, schedule tasks, make `psexec` connections, and run WMI commands.\n+* Legitimate scripts using the `whoami` command.\n+* Applications that work with file shares, such as backup programs, and use the \n+server message block (SMB) protocol.\n+\n+To reduce signal noise for authorized activity, you can do any of the these:\n+\n+* Add a statement or filter to the rules that exclude specific servers, such as \n+the relevant host names, agent names, or other common identifier. \n+For example, `and not host.name : \"server-name\"`.\n+* Add a statement or filter to the rules that <<filter-rule-process, exclude specific processes>>. For example, `and not process.name : \"process-name\"`.\n+* Add a statement or filter to the rules that exclude a common user. \n+For example, `and not user.name : \"security-tester\"`.\n+\n+Another useful technique is to assign lower risk scores to rules triggered by \n+authorized activity. This enables detection while keeping the resulting signals \n+out of high-priority workflows. Use these steps:\n+\n+. Duplicate the same rule twice.\n+. In the first duplication of the rule, exclude the relevant user or process \n+names (`and not user.name : \"user-name\"` or `and not process.name : \"process-name\"`).\n+. In the second duplication of the rule:\n+* Lower the `Risk score` (*Edit rule settings* -> *About* tab).\n+* Change the rule's query or filter so it only matches the user or process \n+names excluded in the first duplication\n+(`and user.name : \"user-name\"` or `and process.name : \"process-name\"`).\n+.

Exceptions could result in an undetected client side execution, or \n+a persistence or malware threat going unnoticed.\n+\n+Examples of when these rules may create noise include:\n+\n+* Receiving and opening email-attached Microsoft Office files, which \n+include active content such as macros or scripts, from a trusted third-party \n+source.\n+* Authorized technical support personnel who provide remote workers with\n+scripts to gather troubleshooting information.\n+\n+In these cases, exceptions can be added to the rules using the relevant \n+`process.name`, `user.name`, and `host.name` conditions.
