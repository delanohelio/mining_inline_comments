Having those configurations automatically deployed is more convenient than doing it yourself using SSH, Ansible playbooks, etc.\n+\n+If you prefer infrastructure as code, you may prefer to use YAML files and APIs. Ingest Manager has an API-first design and anything you can do in the UI you can also do using the API. This makes it easy to automate and integrate with other systems.\n+\n+[float]\n+[[central-management]]\n+=== Central management in Fleet\n+\n+You can see the state of all your Elastic Agents on the Fleet page. Here you can see which agents are online, which have errors, and the last time they checked in. You can also see the version of the Agent binary and configuration. \n+\n+[role=\"screenshot\"]\n+image::images/fleet.png[Fleet page]\n+\n+Fleet serves as the communication channel back to the Elastic Agents. Agents check in for the latest updates on a regular basis. You can have any number of Agents enrolled into each Agent configuration, which allows you to scale up to thousands of hosts. When you make a change to an Agent configuration, all the Agents receive the update during their next check in. You no longer have to distribute configuration updates yourself using SSH, Ansible playbooks, or other configuration methods. \n+\n+[float]\n+[[data-streams]]\n+=== Data streams make index management easier\n+\n+The data collected by Elastic Agents is stored in indices that are more granular than you\u2019d get by default with Filebeat. The advantages are that it gives users more visibility into the sources of data volume, and control over lifecycle management policies and index permissions. We call these new indices \u201cdata streams\u201d and we will have more improvements on this concept in future releases.\n+\n+In the screenshot below, you can see we\u2019ve broken out the data streams (or indices) by dataset, type, and namespace. The dataset is defined by the integration and describes the fields and other settings for each index. For example, you might have one dataset for process metrics with a field describing whether the process is running or not. Another dataset for disk I/O metrics will have a field describing the number of bytes read. This solves the issue of having indices with hundreds or thousands of fields because we only need to store a small number of fields in each index. This makes them more compact with faster autocomplete, and as an added bonus the discover page will only show relevant fields.\n+\n+[role=\"screenshot\"]\n+image::images/data-streams.png[Data streams page]\n+\n+Namespaces are user-defined strings that allow you group data any way you like. For example, you might group your data by environment (prod, QA) or by team name. This makes it easier to search the data from a given source using index patterns, or to give users permissions to data by assigning an index pattern to user roles. Many of our customers already organize their indices this way, and now we are providing this best practice as a default out of the box.\n+\n+When searching your data in Kibana, you can use an [index pattern](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/index-patterns.html) to search across all or some of the indices.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "f2f2f38d16ec5d9aafbfded753c8c1195fc32ac8"}, "originalPosition": 58}]}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 1147, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-12T13:16:51Z"}}}
