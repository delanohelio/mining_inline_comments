Click *Continue*.\n++\n+The *Schedule rule* pane is displayed.\n+[role=\"screenshot\"]\n+image::schedule-rule.png[]\n+. Select how often the rule runs.\n+. Optionally, add `look-back` time to the rule. When defined, the rule searches \n+indices with the additional time.\n++\n+For example, if you set a rule to run every 5 minutes with an additional\n+look-back time of 1 minute, the rule runs every 5 minutes but analyses the \n+documents added to indices during the last 6 minutes. This overlap helps ensure \n+signals are issued even when incoming data is delayed.\n+. Save the rule with or without activation.\n++\n+NOTE: When you activate a rule, it is queued and its schedule is determined by \n+its initial run time. For example, if you activate a rule that runs every 5 \n+minutes at 14:02, but it does not run until 14:04, it will run again at 14:09.\n+\n+[[manage-rules-ui]]\n+==== Modify existing rules\n+\n+You can clone, edit, activate, deactivate, and delete rules:\n+\n+.
