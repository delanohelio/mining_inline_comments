I know it seems odd, but lots of users still search on \"ELK\" when they're first getting started. So here's the backstory:\nOriginally I used \"ELK tutorial\" in the opening paragraph of this topic because forum users kept searching on \"ELK tutorial\" and finding a topic on the Digital Ocean website that recommended old Beats settings. These settings were causing major problems. Adding \"ELK tutorial\" pushed us up quite a bit in the rankings.\nIt looks like @szabosteve removed \"tutorial\" from the topic, but that might be OK because the Digital Ocean tutorial isn't completely broken now.", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/pull/1099#discussion_r428947498", "createdAt": "2020-05-21T22:22:13Z", "author": {"login": "dedemorton"}, "path": "docs/en/getting-started/get-started-stack.asciidoc", "diffHunk": "@@ -6,10 +6,14 @@ Looking for an {stack} (\"ELK\") guide that shows how to quickly install and confi\n * <<install-elasticsearch,{es}>>", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyODc2NDgyNA=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "046429a3af40cc712bf44a61da28d47ffe097eb6"}, "originalPosition": 1}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyOTc1ODgxNA==", "bodyText": "@dedemorton\nYes, it was me back in the DEVO days.
