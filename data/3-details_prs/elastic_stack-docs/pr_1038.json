The exact \n-process always depends on the type of {dfanalytics} \u2013 for example, \n-{classification} or {oldetection} \u2013 that is executed. This is the phase when the \n-job generates a {ml} model for analyzing the dataset.\n+In this phase, the job generates a {ml} model for analyzing the data. The \n+specific phases of analysis vary depending on the type of {dfanalytics-job}.\n+\n+{oldetection-cap} jobs have a single analysis phase called `computing_outliers`, \n+in which they identify outliers in the data.\n+\n+{regression-cap} and {classification} jobs have four analysis phases:\n+\n+. `feature_selection`: Identifies which fields are significant for the analysis.
