E.g. if the user turns on 100's of rules and only has a single Kibana instance, rules may sit in the queue to be run long enough that there is a gap in coverage since the last time it was ran, and thus this additional look-back ensures that gap of data is queried (and then de-duped if it queries into the previous run's interval).\nFeel free to reach out if you have any questions around the corner cases.
