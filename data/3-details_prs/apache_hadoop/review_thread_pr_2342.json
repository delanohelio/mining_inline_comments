(unshaded guava 11?)\nHadoop source uses shaded guava itself from hadoop-thirdparty.\nRather than rewrite once as this PR does, we'd rewrite on every build? How long does the rewrite take?\n\nThis replacer is basically to make the Job easy for this PR.  Since we commit the replaced code itself, further replaces wont happen on same file. It will help to catch further references to unshaded guava. Rewrite doesnot take much time, it finishes in fraction of second.\n\nhadoop-yarn-csi is bound to guava-20? Why is that? The grpc used? Interested in how a guava 20 in classpath won't mess up downstreamers who want to use something newer (or older).\n\nyes, yarn-csi uses grpc. And grpc refers to guava-20 and it uses protobuf 3.x even before protobuf was upgraded for entire hadoop. It keeps separate directory (share/hadoop/yarn/csi/lib) for its dependencies and existing scripts doesnt add this directory into classpath of other processes.\n\nFor 4., hopefully we can (later) add an enforcer so non-shaded references get flagged at build time. Rather than have hadoop depend on something it doesn't use, hopefully we can work on fixing the curator dependency to fix its pom?\n\nyes, If we could add this enforcer, may be we need not find and replace unshaded usage of guava on every build.\nFor curator, curator community is not ready to shade 3 classes of guava as they are part of their API. These classes seems to be pretty stable across versions. So curator does work with guava-11 in classpath.\nIf we want to fix this and completely remove hadoop's dependency on guava, we may need to shade curator as well in hadoop-thirdparty and use that in hadoop.\nWe are fortunate enough that, these dependencies are not part of any exposed APIs.\n\nThanks @vinayakumarb\n\nThanks @saintstack", "url": "https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/2342#discussion_r501229119", "createdAt": "2020-10-07T18:36:00Z", "author": {"login": "vinayakumarb"}, "path": "hadoop-common-project/hadoop-auth/pom.xml", "diffHunk": "@@ -234,6 +235,24 @@\n           <excludeFilterFile>${basedir}/dev-support/findbugsExcludeFile.xml</excludeFilterFile>\n         </configuration>\n       </plugin>\n+      <plugin>\n+        <groupId>com.google.code.maven-replacer-plugin</groupId>\n+        <artifactId>replacer</artifactId>\n+        <executions>\n+          <execution>\n+            <id>replace-sources</id>\n+            <configuration>\n+              <skip>false</skip>\n+            </configuration>\n+          </execution>\n+          <execution>\n+            <id>replace-test-sources</id>\n+            <configuration>\n+              <skip>false</skip>\n+            </configuration>\n+          </execution>\n+        </executions>\n+      </plugin>", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwMDExNjM2MQ=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "e9721616eb6d6a5784c9f3e0027d235bf02cc8cd"}, "originalPosition": 34}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwMTI0NDA1Ng==", "bodyText": "Thanx @vinayakumarb and @saintstack\nSince the discussion is going on here, I thought to get everything here only.\nRegarding guava revert to 11, I think, as you mentioned that would be incompatible, and downstream would be excluding them only, when adding hadoop-jars as dependency.
