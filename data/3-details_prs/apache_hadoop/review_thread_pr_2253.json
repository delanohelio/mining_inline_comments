It's not a blank line newline, but a hidden char. Sharing some thoughts:\n\nNo end of line char can lead to unexpected behavior when using other tools on the file. For e.g. git diff or external diff tools depend on newlines to generate a correct diff. wc command counting lines may also be broken. More can be found at this discussion.\nNext time when someone edits the file, some editors will automatically add a \"newline\" char at the end of this file - for good intention. If so, seems like they \"changed\" the last line of this file in their PR which they do not.\n\nBut that is not a real problem here.
