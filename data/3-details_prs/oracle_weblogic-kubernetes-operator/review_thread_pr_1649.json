It does this by:\n+\n+- Using the same image, image model YAML, and application archive as the Initial and Update1 use cases.\n+- Using the same model update ConfigMap source file as the Update1 use case (a data source).\n+- Using a different (unique) domain UID, `sample-domain2`, for the new domain.\n+- Using a different (unique) domain name, `domain2`, for the different domains.\n+- Deploying secrets and a model update ConfigMap that are uniquely labeled and named for the new domain.\n+\n+Note that this use case shows Model in Image's unique ability to quickly deploy a copy of a WebLogic domain that has a different WebLogic domain name and domain encryption key. This is a useful capability that is not supported by the Domain in Image domain home source type:\n+\n+- A Domain in Image domain home source type does not support overriding the domain name, but different domain names are necessary when two domains need to interoperate. In this use case, we take advantage of model macros to ensure that its two different domains have a different domain name: \n+\n+  - First, we define the domain name in the model YAML using the `@@ENV:CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME@@` environment variable macro.\n+  - Second, we set the value of the `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME` environment variable differently using the `env` stanza in each domain's domain resource.\n+\n+- Domain in Image requires that its images embed a WebLogic `security/SerializedSystemIni.dat` domain encryption key that cannot be changed for the image (see [why layering matters]({{< relref \"/userguide/cicd/why-layering-matters.md\" >}}) in CI/CD Considerations). This necessarily means that two Domain in Image domains that share the same image have the ability to decrypt each other's encrypted passwords. A Model in Image's domain encryption key, on the other hand, is not embedded in the image and is instead dynamically and uniquely created each time the domain is started. \n+\n+{{% notice warning %}}\n+Oracle requires interoperating WebLogic domains to have different domain names. This is necessary when two domains communicate, or when a WebLogic Server or WebLogic java client concurrently connects to multiple domains. \n+{{% /notice %}}\n+\n+Here are the steps for this use case:\n+\n+1. Make sure you have deployed the domain from the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case).\n+\n+1. Create a ConfigMap with the WDT model that contains the data source definition.\n+\n+   Run the following commands:\n+\n+   ```\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create configmap sample-domain2-wdt-config-map \\\n+     --from-file=/tmp/mii-sample/model-configmaps/datasource\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label configmap sample-domain2-wdt-config-map \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain2\n+   ```\n+\n+   If you've created your own data source file in the Update1 use case, then substitute the file name in the `--from-file=` parameter (we suggested `/tmp/mii-sample/mydatasource.yaml` earlier). Note that the `-from-file=` parameter can reference a single file, in which case it puts the designated file in the ConfigMap, or it can reference a directory, in which case it populates the ConfigMap with all of the files in the designated directory.\n+\n+   Observations:\n+     - We are leaving the namespace `sample-domain1-ns` unchanged for the ConfigMap because we plan to deploy domain `sample-domain2` to the same namespace as `sample-domain1`.\n+     - We name and label the ConfigMap using its associated domain UID for two reasons:\n+       - To make it obvious which ConfigMap belongs to which domain.\n+       - To make it easier to cleanup a domain. Typical cleanup scripts use the `weblogic.domainUID` label as a convenience for finding all resources associated with a domain.\n+     - We use a different ConfigMap for the new domain for two reasons:\n+       - To make it easier to keep the life-cycle and/or CI/CD process for the two domains simple and independent. Any shared resources between the two domains must necessarily have their own life-cycle.\n+       - To 'future proof' the new domain so that changes to the original domain or new domain's ConfigMap can be independent.\n+\n+\n+1. Create the secrets that are referenced by the WDT model files in the image and ConfigMap, and that will be referenced by the domain resource.\n+\n+   Run the following commands:\n+   ```\n+   $ # spec.webLogicCredentialsSecret\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create secret generic \\\n+     sample-domain2-weblogic-credentials \\\n+      --from-literal=username=weblogic --from-literal=password=welcome1\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label  secret \\\n+     sample-domain2-weblogic-credentials \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain2\n+\n+   $ # spec.configuration.model.runtimeEncryptionSecret\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create secret generic \\\n+     sample-domain2-runtime-encryption-secret \\\n+      --from-literal=password=my_runtime_password\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label  secret \\\n+     sample-domain2-runtime-encryption-secret \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain2\n+\n+   $ # referenced by spec.configuration.secrets and by the datasource model YAML in the ConfigMap\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create secret generic \\\n+     sample-domain2-datasource-secret \\\n+      --from-literal=password=Oradoc_db1 \\\n+      --from-literal=url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label  secret \\\n+     sample-domain2-datasource-secret \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain2\n+   ```\n+\n+   Observations:\n+     - We are leaving the namespace `sample-domain1-ns` unchanged for each secret because we plan to deploy domain `sample-domain2` to the same namespace as `sample-domain1`.\n+     - We name and label the secrets using their associated domain UID for two reasons:\n+       - To make it obvious which secret belongs to which domain.\n+       - To make it easier to cleanup a domain.

It does this by:\n+\n+- Using the same image, image model YAML, and application archive as the Initial and Update1 use cases.\n+- Using the same model update ConfigMap source file as the Update1 use case (a data source).\n+- Using a different (unique) domain UID, `sample-domain2`, for the new domain.\n+- Using a different (unique) domain name, `domain2`, for the different domains.\n+- Deploying secrets and a model update ConfigMap that are uniquely labeled and named for the new domain.\n+\n+Note that this use case shows Model in Image's unique ability to quickly deploy a copy of a WebLogic domain that has a different WebLogic domain name and domain encryption key. This is a useful capability that is not supported by the Domain in Image domain home source type:\n+\n+- A Domain in Image domain home source type does not support overriding the domain name, but different domain names are necessary when two domains need to interoperate. In this use case, we take advantage of model macros to ensure that its two different domains have a different domain name: \n+\n+  - First, we define the domain name in the model YAML using the `@@ENV:CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME@@` environment variable macro.\n+  - Second, we set the value of the `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME` environment variable differently using the `env` stanza in each domain's domain resource.\n+\n+- Domain in Image requires that its images embed a WebLogic `security/SerializedSystemIni.dat` domain encryption key that cannot be changed for the image (see [why layering matters]({{< relref \"/userguide/cicd/why-layering-matters.md\" >}}) in CI/CD Considerations). This necessarily means that two Domain in Image domains that share the same image have the ability to decrypt each other's encrypted passwords. A Model in Image's domain encryption key, on the other hand, is not embedded in the image and is instead dynamically and uniquely created each time the domain is started. \n+\n+{{% notice warning %}}\n+Oracle requires interoperating WebLogic domains to have different domain names.

Make sure you have deployed the domain from the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case).\n+\n+1. Create a ConfigMap with the WDT model that contains the data source definition.\n+\n+   Run the following commands:\n+\n+   ```\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create configmap sample-domain2-wdt-config-map \\\n+     --from-file=/tmp/mii-sample/model-configmaps/datasource\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label configmap sample-domain2-wdt-config-map \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain2\n+   ```\n+\n+   If you've created your own data source file in the Update1 use case, then substitute the file name in the `--from-file=` parameter (we suggested `/tmp/mii-sample/mydatasource.yaml` earlier). Note that the `-from-file=` parameter can reference a single file, in which case it puts the designated file in the ConfigMap, or it can reference a directory, in which case it populates the ConfigMap with all of the files in the designated directory.\n+\n+   Observations:\n+     - We are leaving the namespace `sample-domain1-ns` unchanged for the ConfigMap because we plan to deploy domain `sample-domain2` to the same namespace as `sample-domain1`.\n+     - We name and label the ConfigMap using its associated domain UID for two reasons:\n+       - To make it obvious which ConfigMap belongs to which domain.\n+       - To make it easier to cleanup a domain. Typical cleanup scripts use the `weblogic.domainUID` label as a convenience for finding all resources associated with a domain.\n+     - We use a different ConfigMap for the new domain for two reasons:\n+       - To make it easier to keep the life-cycle and/or CI/CD process for the two domains simple and independent. Any shared resources between the two domains must necessarily have their own life-cycle.\n+       - To 'future proof' the new domain so that changes to the original domain or new domain's ConfigMap can be independent.\n+\n+\n+1.

It does this by:\n+\n+- Using the same image, image model YAML, and application archive as the Initial and Update1 use cases.\n+- Using the same model update ConfigMap source file as the Update1 use case (a data source).\n+- Using a different (unique) domain UID, `sample-domain2`, for the new domain.\n+- Using a different (unique) domain name, `domain2`, for the different domains.\n+- Deploying secrets and a model update ConfigMap that are uniquely labeled and named for the new domain.\n+\n+Note that this use case shows Model in Image's unique ability to quickly deploy a copy of a WebLogic domain that has a different WebLogic domain name and domain encryption key. This is a useful capability that is not supported by the Domain in Image domain home source type:\n+\n+- A Domain in Image domain home source type does not support overriding the domain name, but different domain names are necessary when two domains need to interoperate. In this use case, we take advantage of model macros to ensure that its two different domains have a different domain name: \n+\n+  - First, we define the domain name in the model YAML using the `@@ENV:CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME@@` environment variable macro.\n+  - Second, we set the value of the `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME` environment variable differently using the `env` stanza in each domain's domain resource.\n+\n+- Domain in Image requires that its images embed a WebLogic `security/SerializedSystemIni.dat` domain encryption key that cannot be changed for the image (see [why layering matters]({{< relref \"/userguide/cicd/why-layering-matters.md\" >}}) in CI/CD Considerations). This necessarily means that two Domain in Image domains that share the same image have the ability to decrypt each other's encrypted passwords. A Model in Image's domain encryption key, on the other hand, is not embedded in the image and is instead dynamically and uniquely created each time the domain is started. \n+\n+{{% notice warning %}}\n+Oracle requires interoperating WebLogic domains to have different domain names.

Note that the `-from-file=` parameter can reference a single file, in which case it puts the designated file in the ConfigMap, or it can reference a directory, in which case it populates the ConfigMap with all of the files in the designated directory.\n+\n+   Observations:\n+     - We are leaving the namespace `sample-domain1-ns` unchanged for the ConfigMap because we plan to deploy domain `sample-domain2` to the same namespace as `sample-domain1`.\n+     - We name and label the ConfigMap using its associated domain UID for two reasons:\n+       - To make it obvious which ConfigMap belongs to which domain.\n+       - To make it easier to cleanup a domain.

Set up a domain resource that is similar to your \"Update1\" use case domain resource but with different domain UID, domain name, model update ConfigMap reference, and secret references:\n+\n+    - Option 1: Update a copy of your domain resource file from the \"Update1\" use case.\n+\n+      - You might recall that in the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case) we suggested creating a file named `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-update1.yaml` or using the `/tmp/mii-sample/domain-resources/WLS/mii-update1-d1-WLS-v1-ds.yaml` file that comes supplied with the sample.\n+        - We suggest copying this domain resource file and naming the copy `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-update2.yaml` before making any changes.\n+\n+        - Working on a copy is not strictly necessary, but it helps to keep track of your work for the different use cases in this sample and also provides you a backup of your previous work.\n+\n+      - Change the `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-update2.yaml` domain resource name and `weblogic.domainUID` label to `sample-domain2`.\n+\n+        The final result should look something like this:\n+\n+          ``` \n+          apiVersion: \"weblogic.oracle/v7\"\n+          kind: Domain\n+          metadata:\n+            name: sample-domain2\n+            namespace: sample-domain1-ns\n+            labels:\n+              weblogic.resourceVersion: domain-v2\n+              weblogic.domainUID: sample-domain2\n+          ```\n+\n+        > __NOTE__: We are leaving the namespace `sample-domain1-ns` unchanged because we will be deploying domain `sample-domain2` to the same namespace as `sample-domain1`.\n+\n+      - Change the `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-update2.yaml` domain resource's `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME` environment variable from `domain1` to `domain2`.\n+\n+        The model file in the image uses macro `@@ENV:CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME@@` to reference this environment variable when setting its domain name. \n+\n+        Specifically, change the corresponding domain resource `spec.serverPod.env` YAML stanza to look something like this:\n+\n+        ```\n+        ...\n+        spec:\n+          ...\n+          serverPod:\n+          ...\n+            env:\n+            - name: CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME\n+              value: \"domain2\"\n+          ...\n+        ```\n+\n+      - Change the `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-update2.yaml` domain resource `spec.domainHome` value to `/u01/domains/sample-domain2`.

It does this by:\n+\n+- Using the same image, image model YAML, and application archive as the Initial and Update1 use cases.\n+- Using the same model update ConfigMap source file as the Update1 use case (a data source).\n+- Using a different (unique) domain UID, `sample-domain2`, for the new domain.\n+- Using a different (unique) domain name, `domain2`, for the different domains.\n+- Deploying secrets and a model update ConfigMap that are uniquely labeled and named for the new domain.\n+\n+Note that this use case shows Model in Image's unique ability to quickly deploy a copy of a WebLogic domain that has a different WebLogic domain name and domain encryption key. This is a useful capability that is not supported by the Domain in Image domain home source type:\n+\n+- A Domain in Image domain home source type does not support overriding the domain name, but different domain names are necessary when two domains need to interoperate. In this use case, we take advantage of model macros to ensure that its two different domains have a different domain name: \n+\n+  - First, we define the domain name in the model YAML using the `@@ENV:CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME@@` environment variable macro.\n+  - Second, we set the value of the `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME` environment variable differently using the `env` stanza in each domain's domain resource.\n+\n+- Domain in Image requires that its images embed a WebLogic `security/SerializedSystemIni.dat` domain encryption key that cannot be changed for the image (see [why layering matters]({{< relref \"/userguide/cicd/why-layering-matters.md\" >}}) in CI/CD Considerations). This necessarily means that two Domain in Image domains that share the same image have the ability to decrypt each other's encrypted passwords. A Model in Image's domain encryption key, on the other hand, is not embedded in the image and is instead dynamically and uniquely created each time the domain is started. \n+\n+{{% notice warning %}}\n+Oracle requires interoperating WebLogic domains to have different domain names.

Make sure you have deployed the domain from the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case).\n+\n+1. Create a ConfigMap with the WDT model that contains the data source definition.\n+\n+   Run the following commands:\n+\n+   ```\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create configmap sample-domain2-wdt-config-map \\\n+     --from-file=/tmp/mii-sample/model-configmaps/datasource\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label configmap sample-domain2-wdt-config-map \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain2\n+   ```\n+\n+   If you've created your own data source file in the Update1 use case, then substitute the file name in the `--from-file=` parameter (we suggested `/tmp/mii-sample/mydatasource.yaml` earlier). Note that the `-from-file=` parameter can reference a single file, in which case it puts the designated file in the ConfigMap, or it can reference a directory, in which case it populates the ConfigMap with all of the files in the designated directory.\n+\n+   Observations:\n+     - We are leaving the namespace `sample-domain1-ns` unchanged for the ConfigMap because we plan to deploy domain `sample-domain2` to the same namespace as `sample-domain1`.\n+     - We name and label the ConfigMap using its associated domain UID for two reasons:\n+       - To make it obvious which ConfigMap belongs to which domain.\n+       - To make it easier to cleanup a domain. Typical cleanup scripts use the `weblogic.domainUID` label as a convenience for finding all resources associated with a domain.\n+     - We use a different ConfigMap for the new domain for two reasons:\n+       - To make it easier to keep the life-cycle and/or CI/CD process for the two domains simple and independent. Any shared resources between the two domains must necessarily have their own life-cycle.\n+       - To 'future proof' the new domain so that changes to the original domain or new domain's ConfigMap can be independent.\n+\n+\n+1.

Once the new image is applied, you can revert by modifying your model's `configuration.model.configMap` to override the related application path in your image model.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "9506ef0b3f5a4e324b7412a4d28a214f7c8a669b"}, "originalPosition": 640}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyNTg3MjY5NA==", "bodyText": "done", "url": "https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/pull/1649#discussion_r425872694", "createdAt": "2020-05-15T15:17:43Z", "author": {"login": "tbarnes-us"}, "path": "docs-source/content/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -1717,8 +1749,890 @@ Here are the steps:\n \n If you see an error, then consult [Debugging]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/debugging.md\" >}}) in the Model in Image user guide.\n \n-This completes the sample scenarios.\n+If you plan to run the [Update3 use case](#update3-use-case), then leave your domain running.\n+\n+### Update2 use case\n+\n+This use case demonstrates concurrently deploying a domain that is similar to the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case) domain to the same `sample-domain1-ns` namespace but with a different domain UID, a different WebLogic domain name, and a different WebLogic domain encryption key. It does this by:\n+\n+- Using the same image, image model YAML, and application archive as the Initial and Update1 use cases.\n+- Using the same model update ConfigMap source file as the Update1 use case (a data source).\n+- Using a different (unique) domain UID, `sample-domain2`, for the new domain.\n+- Using a different (unique) domain name, `domain2`, for the different domains.\n+- Deploying secrets and a model update ConfigMap that are uniquely labeled and named for the new domain.\n+\n+Note that this use case shows Model in Image's unique ability to quickly deploy a copy of a WebLogic domain that has a different WebLogic domain name and domain encryption key. This is a useful capability that is not supported by the Domain in Image domain home source type:\n+\n+- A Domain in Image domain home source type does not support overriding the domain name, but different domain names are necessary when two domains need to interoperate. In this use case, we take advantage of model macros to ensure that its two different domains have a different domain name: \n+\n+  - First, we define the domain name in the model YAML using the `@@ENV:CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME@@` environment variable macro.\n+  - Second, we set the value of the `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME` environment variable differently using the `env` stanza in each domain's domain resource.\n+\n+- Domain in Image requires that its images embed a WebLogic `security/SerializedSystemIni.dat` domain encryption key that cannot be changed for the image (see [why layering matters]({{< relref \"/userguide/cicd/why-layering-matters.md\" >}}) in CI/CD Considerations). This necessarily means that two Domain in Image domains that share the same image have the ability to decrypt each other's encrypted passwords. A Model in Image's domain encryption key, on the other hand, is not embedded in the image and is instead dynamically and uniquely created each time the domain is started. \n+\n+{{% notice warning %}}\n+Oracle requires interoperating WebLogic domains to have different domain names. This is necessary when two domains communicate, or when a WebLogic Server or WebLogic java client concurrently connects to multiple domains. \n+{{% /notice %}}\n+\n+Here are the steps for this use case:\n+\n+1. Make sure you have deployed the domain from the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case).\n+\n+1. Create a ConfigMap with the WDT model that contains the data source definition.\n+\n+   Run the following commands:\n+\n+   ```\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create configmap sample-domain2-wdt-config-map \\\n+     --from-file=/tmp/mii-sample/model-configmaps/datasource\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label configmap sample-domain2-wdt-config-map \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain2\n+   ```\n+\n+   If you've created your own data source file in the Update1 use case, then substitute the file name in the `--from-file=` parameter (we suggested `/tmp/mii-sample/mydatasource.yaml` earlier). Note that the `-from-file=` parameter can reference a single file, in which case it puts the designated file in the ConfigMap, or it can reference a directory, in which case it populates the ConfigMap with all of the files in the designated directory.\n+\n+   Observations:\n+     - We are leaving the namespace `sample-domain1-ns` unchanged for the ConfigMap because we plan to deploy domain `sample-domain2` to the same namespace as `sample-domain1`.\n+     - We name and label the ConfigMap using its associated domain UID for two reasons:\n+       - To make it obvious which ConfigMap belongs to which domain.\n+       - To make it easier to cleanup a domain. Typical cleanup scripts use the `weblogic.domainUID` label as a convenience for finding all resources associated with a domain.\n+     - We use a different ConfigMap for the new domain for two reasons:\n+       - To make it easier to keep the life-cycle and/or CI/CD process for the two domains simple and independent. Any shared resources between the two domains must necessarily have their own life-cycle.\n+       - To 'future proof' the new domain so that changes to the original domain or new domain's ConfigMap can be independent.\n+\n+\n+1. Create the secrets that are referenced by the WDT model files in the image and ConfigMap, and that will be referenced by the domain resource.\n+\n+   Run the following commands:\n+   ```\n+   $ # spec.webLogicCredentialsSecret\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create secret generic \\\n+     sample-domain2-weblogic-credentials \\\n+      --from-literal=username=weblogic --from-literal=password=welcome1\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label  secret \\\n+     sample-domain2-weblogic-credentials \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain2\n+\n+   $ # spec.configuration.model.runtimeEncryptionSecret\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create secret generic \\\n+     sample-domain2-runtime-encryption-secret \\\n+      --from-literal=password=my_runtime_password\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label  secret \\\n+     sample-domain2-runtime-encryption-secret \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain2\n+\n+   $ # referenced by spec.configuration.secrets and by the datasource model YAML in the ConfigMap\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create secret generic \\\n+     sample-domain2-datasource-secret \\\n+      --from-literal=password=Oradoc_db1 \\\n+      --from-literal=url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label  secret \\\n+     sample-domain2-datasource-secret \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain2\n+   ```\n+\n+   Observations:\n+     - We are leaving the namespace `sample-domain1-ns` unchanged for each secret because we plan to deploy domain `sample-domain2` to the same namespace as `sample-domain1`.\n+     - We name and label the secrets using their associated domain UID for two reasons:\n+       - To make it obvious which secret belongs to which domain.\n+       - To make it easier to cleanup a domain.

It does this by:\n+\n+- Using the same image, image model YAML, and application archive as the Initial and Update1 use cases.\n+- Using the same model update ConfigMap source file as the Update1 use case (a data source).\n+- Using a different (unique) domain UID, `sample-domain2`, for the new domain.\n+- Using a different (unique) domain name, `domain2`, for the different domains.\n+- Deploying secrets and a model update ConfigMap that are uniquely labeled and named for the new domain.\n+\n+Note that this use case shows Model in Image's unique ability to quickly deploy a copy of a WebLogic domain that has a different WebLogic domain name and domain encryption key. This is a useful capability that is not supported by the Domain in Image domain home source type:\n+\n+- A Domain in Image domain home source type does not support overriding the domain name, but different domain names are necessary when two domains need to interoperate. In this use case, we take advantage of model macros to ensure that its two different domains have a different domain name: \n+\n+  - First, we define the domain name in the model YAML using the `@@ENV:CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME@@` environment variable macro.\n+  - Second, we set the value of the `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME` environment variable differently using the `env` stanza in each domain's domain resource.\n+\n+- Domain in Image requires that its images embed a WebLogic `security/SerializedSystemIni.dat` domain encryption key that cannot be changed for the image (see [why layering matters]({{< relref \"/userguide/cicd/why-layering-matters.md\" >}}) in CI/CD Considerations). This necessarily means that two Domain in Image domains that share the same image have the ability to decrypt each other's encrypted passwords. A Model in Image's domain encryption key, on the other hand, is not embedded in the image and is instead dynamically and uniquely created each time the domain is started. \n+\n+{{% notice warning %}}\n+Oracle requires interoperating WebLogic domains to have different domain names. This is necessary when two domains communicate, or when a WebLogic Server or WebLogic java client concurrently connects to multiple domains. \n+{{% /notice %}}\n+\n+Here are the steps for this use case:\n+\n+1. Make sure you have deployed the domain from the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case).\n+\n+1. Create a ConfigMap with the WDT model that contains the data source definition.\n+\n+   Run the following commands:\n+\n+   ```\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create configmap sample-domain2-wdt-config-map \\\n+     --from-file=/tmp/mii-sample/model-configmaps/datasource\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label configmap sample-domain2-wdt-config-map \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain2\n+   ```\n+\n+   If you've created your own data source file in the Update1 use case, then substitute the file name in the `--from-file=` parameter (we suggested `/tmp/mii-sample/mydatasource.yaml` earlier). Note that the `-from-file=` parameter can reference a single file, in which case it puts the designated file in the ConfigMap, or it can reference a directory, in which case it populates the ConfigMap with all of the files in the designated directory.\n+\n+   Observations:\n+     - We are leaving the namespace `sample-domain1-ns` unchanged for the ConfigMap because we plan to deploy domain `sample-domain2` to the same namespace as `sample-domain1`.\n+     - We name and label the ConfigMap using its associated domain UID for two reasons:\n+       - To make it obvious which ConfigMap belongs to which domain.\n+       - To make it easier to cleanup a domain. Typical cleanup scripts use the `weblogic.domainUID` label as a convenience for finding all resources associated with a domain.\n+     - We use a different ConfigMap for the new domain for two reasons:\n+       - To make it easier to keep the life-cycle and/or CI/CD process for the two domains simple and independent.

Typical cleanup scripts use the `weblogic.domainUID` label as a convenience for finding all resources associated with a domain.\n+     - We use a different set of secrets for the new domain for two reasons:\n+       - To make it easier to keep the life-cycle and/or CI/CD process for the two domains simple and independent. \n+       - To 'future proof' the new domain so that changes to the original domain's secrets or new domain's secrets can be independent.\n+\n+   If you're following the `JRF` path through the sample, then you also need to deploy the additional secret referenced by macros in the `JRF` model `RCUDbInfo` clause, plus an `OPSS` wallet password secret.

The staged files included a web application in a WDT zip archive, and WDT model configuration for a WebLogic Administration Server called `admin-server` and a WebLogic cluster called `cluster-1`.

This is a useful capability that is not supported by the Domain in Image domain home source type:\n+\n+- A Domain in Image domain home source type does not support overriding the domain name, but different domain names are necessary when two domains need to interoperate. In this use case, we take advantage of model macros to ensure that its two different domains have a different domain name: \n+\n+  - First, we define the domain name in the model YAML using the `@@ENV:CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME@@` environment variable macro.\n+  - Second, we set the value of the `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME` environment variable differently using the `env` stanza in each domain's domain resource.\n+\n+- Domain in Image requires that its images embed a WebLogic `security/SerializedSystemIni.dat` domain encryption key that cannot be changed for the image (see [why layering matters]({{< relref \"/userguide/cicd/why-layering-matters.md\" >}}) in CI/CD Considerations). This necessarily means that two Domain in Image domains that share the same image have the ability to decrypt each other's encrypted passwords.

We leave it there to demonstrate that the old version can remain in case you want to revert to it. Once the new image is applied, you can revert by modifying your model's `configuration.model.configMap` to override the related application path in your image model.\n+\n+Here are the steps for this use case:\n+\n+1. Make sure you have deployed the domain from the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case).\n+\n+2. Create an updated image. \n+\n+   Recall that a goal of the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) was to demonstrate using the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image named `model-in-image:WLS-v1` from files that were staged in `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image:WLS-v1/`. The staged files included a web application in a WDT zip archive, and WDT model configuration for a WebLogic Administration Server called `admin-server` and a WebLogic cluster called `cluster-1`. The final image was called `model-in-image:WLS-v1` and, in addition to having a copy of the staged files in its `/u01/wdt/models` directory, also contained a WebLogic installation and a WebLogic Deploy Tooling installation.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyNTgwMTA3OA=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "9506ef0b3f5a4e324b7412a4d28a214f7c8a669b"}, "originalPosition": 648}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMjY1MTU1MzExOnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "docs-source/content/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md", "isResolved": true, "comments": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNS0xNVQxMzoyODozNlrOGWE4fg==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNS0xNVQxNToxNzo1OFrOGWJN3g==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyNTgwMTg1NA==", "bodyText": "a single difference with -> a single difference from", "url": "https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/pull/1649#discussion_r425801854", "createdAt": "2020-05-15T13:28:36Z", "author": {"login": "rosemarymarano"}, "path": "docs-source/content/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -1717,8 +1749,890 @@ Here are the steps:\n \n If you see an error, then consult [Debugging]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/debugging.md\" >}}) in the Model in Image user guide.\n \n-This completes the sample scenarios.\n+If you plan to run the [Update3 use case](#update3-use-case), then leave your domain running.\n+\n+### Update2 use case\n+\n+This use case demonstrates concurrently deploying a domain that is similar to the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case) domain to the same `sample-domain1-ns` namespace but with a different domain UID, a different WebLogic domain name, and a different WebLogic domain encryption key. It does this by:\n+\n+- Using the same image, image model YAML, and application archive as the Initial and Update1 use cases.\n+- Using the same model update ConfigMap source file as the Update1 use case (a data source).\n+- Using a different (unique) domain UID, `sample-domain2`, for the new domain.\n+- Using a different (unique) domain name, `domain2`, for the different domains.\n+- Deploying secrets and a model update ConfigMap that are uniquely labeled and named for the new domain.\n+\n+Note that this use case shows Model in Image's unique ability to quickly deploy a copy of a WebLogic domain that has a different WebLogic domain name and domain encryption key. This is a useful capability that is not supported by the Domain in Image domain home source type:\n+\n+- A Domain in Image domain home source type does not support overriding the domain name, but different domain names are necessary when two domains need to interoperate. In this use case, we take advantage of model macros to ensure that its two different domains have a different domain name: \n+\n+  - First, we define the domain name in the model YAML using the `@@ENV:CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME@@` environment variable macro.\n+  - Second, we set the value of the `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME` environment variable differently using the `env` stanza in each domain's domain resource.\n+\n+- Domain in Image requires that its images embed a WebLogic `security/SerializedSystemIni.dat` domain encryption key that cannot be changed for the image (see [why layering matters]({{< relref \"/userguide/cicd/why-layering-matters.md\" >}}) in CI/CD Considerations). This necessarily means that two Domain in Image domains that share the same image have the ability to decrypt each other's encrypted passwords. A Model in Image's domain encryption key, on the other hand, is not embedded in the image and is instead dynamically and uniquely created each time the domain is started. \n+\n+{{% notice warning %}}\n+Oracle requires interoperating WebLogic domains to have different domain names.

Make sure you have deployed the domain from the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case).\n+\n+1. Create a ConfigMap with the WDT model that contains the data source definition.\n+\n+   Run the following commands:\n+\n+   ```\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create configmap sample-domain2-wdt-config-map \\\n+     --from-file=/tmp/mii-sample/model-configmaps/datasource\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label configmap sample-domain2-wdt-config-map \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain2\n+   ```\n+\n+   If you've created your own data source file in the Update1 use case, then substitute the file name in the `--from-file=` parameter (we suggested `/tmp/mii-sample/mydatasource.yaml` earlier). Note that the `-from-file=` parameter can reference a single file, in which case it puts the designated file in the ConfigMap, or it can reference a directory, in which case it populates the ConfigMap with all of the files in the designated directory.\n+\n+   Observations:\n+     - We are leaving the namespace `sample-domain1-ns` unchanged for the ConfigMap because we plan to deploy domain `sample-domain2` to the same namespace as `sample-domain1`.\n+     - We name and label the ConfigMap using its associated domain UID for two reasons:\n+       - To make it obvious which ConfigMap belongs to which domain.\n+       - To make it easier to cleanup a domain. Typical cleanup scripts use the `weblogic.domainUID` label as a convenience for finding all resources associated with a domain.\n+     - We use a different ConfigMap for the new domain for two reasons:\n+       - To make it easier to keep the life-cycle and/or CI/CD process for the two domains simple and independent.

We leave it there to demonstrate that the old version can remain in case you want to revert to it. Once the new image is applied, you can revert by modifying your model's `configuration.model.configMap` to override the related application path in your image model.\n+\n+Here are the steps for this use case:\n+\n+1. Make sure you have deployed the domain from the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case).\n+\n+2. Create an updated image. \n+\n+   Recall that a goal of the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) was to demonstrate using the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image named `model-in-image:WLS-v1` from files that were staged in `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image:WLS-v1/`. The staged files included a web application in a WDT zip archive, and WDT model configuration for a WebLogic Administration Server called `admin-server` and a WebLogic cluster called `cluster-1`. The final image was called `model-in-image:WLS-v1` and, in addition to having a copy of the staged files in its `/u01/wdt/models` directory, also contained a WebLogic installation and a WebLogic Deploy Tooling installation.\n+\n+   In this use case, we will follow similar steps to the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) in order to create a new image with an updated application and model, plus deploy the updated model and application to the running [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case) domain.\n+\n+   - Understanding our updated WDT archive.\n+\n+     The updated archive for this use case is in directory `/tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v2`. We will use it to create an archive ZIP file for the image. This archive is similar to the `/tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v1` from the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) with the the following differences:\n+     - It includes an updated version of the application in `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2` (while keeping the original application in directory `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v1`).\n+     - The application in `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2/myapp_war/index.jsp` contains a single difference with the original application: it changes the line `out.println(\"Hello World!

It does this by:\n+\n+- Using the same image, image model YAML, and application archive as the Initial and Update1 use cases.\n+- Using the same model update ConfigMap source file as the Update1 use case (a data source).\n+- Using a different (unique) domain UID, `sample-domain2`, for the new domain.\n+- Using a different (unique) domain name, `domain2`, for the different domains.\n+- Deploying secrets and a model update ConfigMap that are uniquely labeled and named for the new domain.\n+\n+Note that this use case shows Model in Image's unique ability to quickly deploy a copy of a WebLogic domain that has a different WebLogic domain name and domain encryption key. This is a useful capability that is not supported by the Domain in Image domain home source type:\n+\n+- A Domain in Image domain home source type does not support overriding the domain name, but different domain names are necessary when two domains need to interoperate. In this use case, we take advantage of model macros to ensure that its two different domains have a different domain name: \n+\n+  - First, we define the domain name in the model YAML using the `@@ENV:CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME@@` environment variable macro.\n+  - Second, we set the value of the `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME` environment variable differently using the `env` stanza in each domain's domain resource.\n+\n+- Domain in Image requires that its images embed a WebLogic `security/SerializedSystemIni.dat` domain encryption key that cannot be changed for the image (see [why layering matters]({{< relref \"/userguide/cicd/why-layering-matters.md\" >}}) in CI/CD Considerations). This necessarily means that two Domain in Image domains that share the same image have the ability to decrypt each other's encrypted passwords. A Model in Image's domain encryption key, on the other hand, is not embedded in the image and is instead dynamically and uniquely created each time the domain is started. \n+\n+{{% notice warning %}}\n+Oracle requires interoperating WebLogic domains to have different domain names. This is necessary when two domains communicate, or when a WebLogic Server or WebLogic java client concurrently connects to multiple domains. \n+{{% /notice %}}\n+\n+Here are the steps for this use case:\n+\n+1. Make sure you have deployed the domain from the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case).\n+\n+1. Create a ConfigMap with the WDT model that contains the data source definition.\n+\n+   Run the following commands:\n+\n+   ```\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create configmap sample-domain2-wdt-config-map \\\n+     --from-file=/tmp/mii-sample/model-configmaps/datasource\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label configmap sample-domain2-wdt-config-map \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain2\n+   ```\n+\n+   If you've created your own data source file in the Update1 use case, then substitute the file name in the `--from-file=` parameter (we suggested `/tmp/mii-sample/mydatasource.yaml` earlier). Note that the `-from-file=` parameter can reference a single file, in which case it puts the designated file in the ConfigMap, or it can reference a directory, in which case it populates the ConfigMap with all of the files in the designated directory.\n+\n+   Observations:\n+     - We are leaving the namespace `sample-domain1-ns` unchanged for the ConfigMap because we plan to deploy domain `sample-domain2` to the same namespace as `sample-domain1`.\n+     - We name and label the ConfigMap using its associated domain UID for two reasons:\n+       - To make it obvious which ConfigMap belongs to which domain.\n+       - To make it easier to cleanup a domain.

We leave it there to demonstrate that the old version can remain in case you want to revert to it. Once the new image is applied, you can revert by modifying your model's `configuration.model.configMap` to override the related application path in your image model.\n+\n+Here are the steps for this use case:\n+\n+1. Make sure you have deployed the domain from the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case).\n+\n+2. Create an updated image. \n+\n+   Recall that a goal of the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) was to demonstrate using the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image named `model-in-image:WLS-v1` from files that were staged in `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image:WLS-v1/`. The staged files included a web application in a WDT zip archive, and WDT model configuration for a WebLogic Administration Server called `admin-server` and a WebLogic cluster called `cluster-1`. The final image was called `model-in-image:WLS-v1` and, in addition to having a copy of the staged files in its `/u01/wdt/models` directory, also contained a WebLogic installation and a WebLogic Deploy Tooling installation.\n+\n+   In this use case, we will follow similar steps to the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) in order to create a new image with an updated application and model, plus deploy the updated model and application to the running [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case) domain.\n+\n+   - Understanding our updated WDT archive.\n+\n+     The updated archive for this use case is in directory `/tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v2`. We will use it to create an archive ZIP file for the image. This archive is similar to the `/tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v1` from the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) with the the following differences:\n+     - It includes an updated version of the application in `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2` (while keeping the original application in directory `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v1`).\n+     - The application in `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2/myapp_war/index.jsp` contains a single difference with the original application: it changes the line `out.println(\"Hello World!

This is a useful capability that is not supported by the Domain in Image domain home source type:\n+\n+- A Domain in Image domain home source type does not support overriding the domain name, but different domain names are necessary when two domains need to interoperate. In this use case, we take advantage of model macros to ensure that its two different domains have a different domain name: \n+\n+  - First, we define the domain name in the model YAML using the `@@ENV:CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME@@` environment variable macro.\n+  - Second, we set the value of the `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME` environment variable differently using the `env` stanza in each domain's domain resource.\n+\n+- Domain in Image requires that its images embed a WebLogic `security/SerializedSystemIni.dat` domain encryption key that cannot be changed for the image (see [why layering matters]({{< relref \"/userguide/cicd/why-layering-matters.md\" >}}) in CI/CD Considerations). This necessarily means that two Domain in Image domains that share the same image have the ability to decrypt each other's encrypted passwords. A Model in Image's domain encryption key, on the other hand, is not embedded in the image and is instead dynamically and uniquely created each time the domain is started. \n+\n+{{% notice warning %}}\n+Oracle requires interoperating WebLogic domains to have different domain names.

We leave it there to demonstrate that the old version can remain in case you want to revert to it. Once the new image is applied, you can revert by modifying your model's `configuration.model.configMap` to override the related application path in your image model.\n+\n+Here are the steps for this use case:\n+\n+1. Make sure you have deployed the domain from the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case).\n+\n+2. Create an updated image. \n+\n+   Recall that a goal of the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) was to demonstrate using the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image named `model-in-image:WLS-v1` from files that were staged in `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image:WLS-v1/`. The staged files included a web application in a WDT zip archive, and WDT model configuration for a WebLogic Administration Server called `admin-server` and a WebLogic cluster called `cluster-1`. The final image was called `model-in-image:WLS-v1` and, in addition to having a copy of the staged files in its `/u01/wdt/models` directory, also contained a WebLogic installation and a WebLogic Deploy Tooling installation.\n+\n+   In this use case, we will follow similar steps to the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) in order to create a new image with an updated application and model, plus deploy the updated model and application to the running [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case) domain.\n+\n+   - Understanding our updated WDT archive.\n+\n+     The updated archive for this use case is in directory `/tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v2`. We will use it to create an archive ZIP file for the image. This archive is similar to the `/tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v1` from the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) with the the following differences:\n+     - It includes an updated version of the application in `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2` (while keeping the original application in directory `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v1`).\n+     - The application in `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2/myapp_war/index.jsp` contains a single difference with the original application: it changes the line `out.println(\"Hello World! This is version 'v1' of the mii-sample JSP web-app.\");` to `out.println(\"Hello World! This is version 'v2' of the mii-sample JSP web-app.\");`.\n+\n+     For additional information about archives, see the [Understanding our first archive](#understanding-our-first-archive) section in the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) within this sample.\n+\n+   - Stage a ZIP file of the WDT archive.\n+\n+     > **Note**: If you are using JRF in this sample, substitute `JRF` for each occurrence of `WLS` in the paths below.\n+\n+     When we create our updated image, we will use the files in staging directory `/tmp/mii-sample/model-in-image__WLS-v2`. In preparation, we need it to contain a ZIP file of the new WDT application archive.\n+\n+     Run the following commands to create your application archive ZIP file and put it in the expected directory:\n+\n+     ```\n+     # Delete existing archive.zip in case we have an old leftover version\n+     $ rm -f /tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip\n+\n+     # Move to the directory which contains the source files for our new archive\n+     $ cd /tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v2\n+\n+     # Zip the archive to the location will later use when we run the WebLogic Image Tool\n+     $ zip -r /tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip wlsdeploy\n+     ```\n+\n+   - Understanding our staged model files.\n+\n+     The WDT model YAML file and properties for this use case have already been staged for you to directory `/tmp/mii-sample/model-in-image__WLS-v2`. \n+\n+     The `model.10.yaml` file in this directory has an updated path `wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2` that references the updated web application in our archive, but is otherwise identical to the model staged for the original image. The final related YAML stanza looks like this:\n+\n+     ```\n+     appDeployments:\n+         Application:\n+             myapp:\n+                 SourcePath: 'wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2'\n+                 ModuleType: ear\n+                 Target: 'cluster-1'\n+     ```\n+\n+     If you would like to review the entire original model before this change, see [Staging model files](#staging-model-files) in the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) within this sample.\n+\n+   - Create a new image from our staged model files using WIT.\n+\n+     > **Note**: If you are using JRF in this sample, substitute `JRF` for each occurrence of `WLS` in the `imagetool` command line below, plus substitute `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4` for the `--fromImage` value.\n+\n+     At this point, we have staged all of the files needed for image `model-in-image:WLS-v2`, they include:\n+\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/weblogic-deploy.zip`\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.yaml`\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.properties`\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip`\n+\n+     If you don't see the `weblogic-deploy.zip` file, then it means that you missed a step in the prerequisites.\n+\n+     Now let's use the Image Tool to create an image named `model-in-image:WLS-v2` that's layered on a base WebLogic image. We've already set up this tool during the prerequisite steps at the beginning of this sample.\n+\n+     Run the following commands to create the model image and verify that it worked:\n+\n+     ```\n+     $ cd /tmp/mii-sample/model-images\n+     $ ./imagetool/bin/imagetool.sh update \\\n+       --tag model-in-image:WLS-v2 \\\n+       --fromImage container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4 \\\n+       --wdtModel      ./model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.yaml \\\n+       --wdtVariables  ./model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.properties \\\n+       --wdtArchive    ./model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip \\\n+       --wdtModelOnly \\\n+       --wdtDomainType WLS\n+     ```\n+\n+     If you don't see the `imagetool` directory, then it means that you missed a step in the prerequisites.\n+\n+     This command runs the WebLogic Image Tool in its Model in Image mode, and does the following:\n+     - Builds the final Docker image as a layer on the `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4` base image.\n+     - Copies the WDT ZIP file that's referenced in the WIT cache into the image.\n+       - Note that we cached WDT in WIT using the keyword `latest` when we set up the cache during the sample prerequisites steps.\n+       - This lets WIT implicitly assume its the desired WDT version and removes the need to pass a `-wdtVersion` flag.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "9506ef0b3f5a4e324b7412a4d28a214f7c8a669b"}, "originalPosition": 731}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyNTg3MjkzOQ==", "bodyText": "done", "url": "https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/pull/1649#discussion_r425872939", "createdAt": "2020-05-15T15:18:04Z", "author": {"login": "tbarnes-us"}, "path": "docs-source/content/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -1717,8 +1749,890 @@ Here are the steps:\n \n If you see an error, then consult [Debugging]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/debugging.md\" >}}) in the Model in Image user guide.\n \n-This completes the sample scenarios.\n+If you plan to run the [Update3 use case](#update3-use-case), then leave your domain running.\n+\n+### Update2 use case\n+\n+This use case demonstrates concurrently deploying a domain that is similar to the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case) domain to the same `sample-domain1-ns` namespace but with a different domain UID, a different WebLogic domain name, and a different WebLogic domain encryption key. It does this by:\n+\n+- Using the same image, image model YAML, and application archive as the Initial and Update1 use cases.\n+- Using the same model update ConfigMap source file as the Update1 use case (a data source).\n+- Using a different (unique) domain UID, `sample-domain2`, for the new domain.\n+- Using a different (unique) domain name, `domain2`, for the different domains.\n+- Deploying secrets and a model update ConfigMap that are uniquely labeled and named for the new domain.\n+\n+Note that this use case shows Model in Image's unique ability to quickly deploy a copy of a WebLogic domain that has a different WebLogic domain name and domain encryption key. This is a useful capability that is not supported by the Domain in Image domain home source type:\n+\n+- A Domain in Image domain home source type does not support overriding the domain name, but different domain names are necessary when two domains need to interoperate. In this use case, we take advantage of model macros to ensure that its two different domains have a different domain name: \n+\n+  - First, we define the domain name in the model YAML using the `@@ENV:CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME@@` environment variable macro.\n+  - Second, we set the value of the `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME` environment variable differently using the `env` stanza in each domain's domain resource.\n+\n+- Domain in Image requires that its images embed a WebLogic `security/SerializedSystemIni.dat` domain encryption key that cannot be changed for the image (see [why layering matters]({{< relref \"/userguide/cicd/why-layering-matters.md\" >}}) in CI/CD Considerations). This necessarily means that two Domain in Image domains that share the same image have the ability to decrypt each other's encrypted passwords. A Model in Image's domain encryption key, on the other hand, is not embedded in the image and is instead dynamically and uniquely created each time the domain is started. \n+\n+{{% notice warning %}}\n+Oracle requires interoperating WebLogic domains to have different domain names.

Note that the `-from-file=` parameter can reference a single file, in which case it puts the designated file in the ConfigMap, or it can reference a directory, in which case it populates the ConfigMap with all of the files in the designated directory.\n+\n+   Observations:\n+     - We are leaving the namespace `sample-domain1-ns` unchanged for the ConfigMap because we plan to deploy domain `sample-domain2` to the same namespace as `sample-domain1`.\n+     - We name and label the ConfigMap using its associated domain UID for two reasons:\n+       - To make it obvious which ConfigMap belongs to which domain.\n+       - To make it easier to cleanup a domain. Typical cleanup scripts use the `weblogic.domainUID` label as a convenience for finding all resources associated with a domain.\n+     - We use a different ConfigMap for the new domain for two reasons:\n+       - To make it easier to keep the life-cycle and/or CI/CD process for the two domains simple and independent.

We leave it there to demonstrate that the old version can remain in case you want to revert to it. Once the new image is applied, you can revert by modifying your model's `configuration.model.configMap` to override the related application path in your image model.\n+\n+Here are the steps for this use case:\n+\n+1. Make sure you have deployed the domain from the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case).\n+\n+2. Create an updated image. \n+\n+   Recall that a goal of the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) was to demonstrate using the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image named `model-in-image:WLS-v1` from files that were staged in `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image:WLS-v1/`. The staged files included a web application in a WDT zip archive, and WDT model configuration for a WebLogic Administration Server called `admin-server` and a WebLogic cluster called `cluster-1`. The final image was called `model-in-image:WLS-v1` and, in addition to having a copy of the staged files in its `/u01/wdt/models` directory, also contained a WebLogic installation and a WebLogic Deploy Tooling installation.\n+\n+   In this use case, we will follow similar steps to the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) in order to create a new image with an updated application and model, plus deploy the updated model and application to the running [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case) domain.\n+\n+   - Understanding our updated WDT archive.\n+\n+     The updated archive for this use case is in directory `/tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v2`. We will use it to create an archive ZIP file for the image. This archive is similar to the `/tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v1` from the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) with the the following differences:\n+     - It includes an updated version of the application in `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2` (while keeping the original application in directory `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v1`).\n+     - The application in `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2/myapp_war/index.jsp` contains a single difference with the original application: it changes the line `out.println(\"Hello World!

It does this by:\n+\n+- Using the same image, image model YAML, and application archive as the Initial and Update1 use cases.\n+- Using the same model update ConfigMap source file as the Update1 use case (a data source).\n+- Using a different (unique) domain UID, `sample-domain2`, for the new domain.\n+- Using a different (unique) domain name, `domain2`, for the different domains.\n+- Deploying secrets and a model update ConfigMap that are uniquely labeled and named for the new domain.\n+\n+Note that this use case shows Model in Image's unique ability to quickly deploy a copy of a WebLogic domain that has a different WebLogic domain name and domain encryption key. This is a useful capability that is not supported by the Domain in Image domain home source type:\n+\n+- A Domain in Image domain home source type does not support overriding the domain name, but different domain names are necessary when two domains need to interoperate. In this use case, we take advantage of model macros to ensure that its two different domains have a different domain name: \n+\n+  - First, we define the domain name in the model YAML using the `@@ENV:CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME@@` environment variable macro.\n+  - Second, we set the value of the `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME` environment variable differently using the `env` stanza in each domain's domain resource.\n+\n+- Domain in Image requires that its images embed a WebLogic `security/SerializedSystemIni.dat` domain encryption key that cannot be changed for the image (see [why layering matters]({{< relref \"/userguide/cicd/why-layering-matters.md\" >}}) in CI/CD Considerations). This necessarily means that two Domain in Image domains that share the same image have the ability to decrypt each other's encrypted passwords. A Model in Image's domain encryption key, on the other hand, is not embedded in the image and is instead dynamically and uniquely created each time the domain is started. \n+\n+{{% notice warning %}}\n+Oracle requires interoperating WebLogic domains to have different domain names.

Make sure you have deployed the domain from the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case).\n+\n+1. Create a ConfigMap with the WDT model that contains the data source definition.\n+\n+   Run the following commands:\n+\n+   ```\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create configmap sample-domain2-wdt-config-map \\\n+     --from-file=/tmp/mii-sample/model-configmaps/datasource\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label configmap sample-domain2-wdt-config-map \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain2\n+   ```\n+\n+   If you've created your own data source file in the Update1 use case, then substitute the file name in the `--from-file=` parameter (we suggested `/tmp/mii-sample/mydatasource.yaml` earlier). Note that the `-from-file=` parameter can reference a single file, in which case it puts the designated file in the ConfigMap, or it can reference a directory, in which case it populates the ConfigMap with all of the files in the designated directory.\n+\n+   Observations:\n+     - We are leaving the namespace `sample-domain1-ns` unchanged for the ConfigMap because we plan to deploy domain `sample-domain2` to the same namespace as `sample-domain1`.\n+     - We name and label the ConfigMap using its associated domain UID for two reasons:\n+       - To make it obvious which ConfigMap belongs to which domain.\n+       - To make it easier to cleanup a domain. Typical cleanup scripts use the `weblogic.domainUID` label as a convenience for finding all resources associated with a domain.\n+     - We use a different ConfigMap for the new domain for two reasons:\n+       - To make it easier to keep the life-cycle and/or CI/CD process for the two domains simple and independent. Any shared resources between the two domains must necessarily have their own life-cycle.\n+       - To 'future proof' the new domain so that changes to the original domain or new domain's ConfigMap can be independent.\n+\n+\n+1.

We leave it there to demonstrate that the old version can remain in case you want to revert to it. Once the new image is applied, you can revert by modifying your model's `configuration.model.configMap` to override the related application path in your image model.\n+\n+Here are the steps for this use case:\n+\n+1. Make sure you have deployed the domain from the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case).\n+\n+2. Create an updated image. \n+\n+   Recall that a goal of the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) was to demonstrate using the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image named `model-in-image:WLS-v1` from files that were staged in `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image:WLS-v1/`. The staged files included a web application in a WDT zip archive, and WDT model configuration for a WebLogic Administration Server called `admin-server` and a WebLogic cluster called `cluster-1`. The final image was called `model-in-image:WLS-v1` and, in addition to having a copy of the staged files in its `/u01/wdt/models` directory, also contained a WebLogic installation and a WebLogic Deploy Tooling installation.\n+\n+   In this use case, we will follow similar steps to the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) in order to create a new image with an updated application and model, plus deploy the updated model and application to the running [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case) domain.\n+\n+   - Understanding our updated WDT archive.\n+\n+     The updated archive for this use case is in directory `/tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v2`. We will use it to create an archive ZIP file for the image. This archive is similar to the `/tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v1` from the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) with the the following differences:\n+     - It includes an updated version of the application in `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2` (while keeping the original application in directory `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v1`).\n+     - The application in `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2/myapp_war/index.jsp` contains a single difference with the original application: it changes the line `out.println(\"Hello World! This is version 'v1' of the mii-sample JSP web-app.\");` to `out.println(\"Hello World! This is version 'v2' of the mii-sample JSP web-app.\");`.\n+\n+     For additional information about archives, see the [Understanding our first archive](#understanding-our-first-archive) section in the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) within this sample.\n+\n+   - Stage a ZIP file of the WDT archive.\n+\n+     > **Note**: If you are using JRF in this sample, substitute `JRF` for each occurrence of `WLS` in the paths below.\n+\n+     When we create our updated image, we will use the files in staging directory `/tmp/mii-sample/model-in-image__WLS-v2`. In preparation, we need it to contain a ZIP file of the new WDT application archive.\n+\n+     Run the following commands to create your application archive ZIP file and put it in the expected directory:\n+\n+     ```\n+     # Delete existing archive.zip in case we have an old leftover version\n+     $ rm -f /tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip\n+\n+     # Move to the directory which contains the source files for our new archive\n+     $ cd /tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v2\n+\n+     # Zip the archive to the location will later use when we run the WebLogic Image Tool\n+     $ zip -r /tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip wlsdeploy\n+     ```\n+\n+   - Understanding our staged model files.\n+\n+     The WDT model YAML file and properties for this use case have already been staged for you to directory `/tmp/mii-sample/model-in-image__WLS-v2`. \n+\n+     The `model.10.yaml` file in this directory has an updated path `wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2` that references the updated web application in our archive, but is otherwise identical to the model staged for the original image. The final related YAML stanza looks like this:\n+\n+     ```\n+     appDeployments:\n+         Application:\n+             myapp:\n+                 SourcePath: 'wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2'\n+                 ModuleType: ear\n+                 Target: 'cluster-1'\n+     ```\n+\n+     If you would like to review the entire original model before this change, see [Staging model files](#staging-model-files) in the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) within this sample.\n+\n+   - Create a new image from our staged model files using WIT.\n+\n+     > **Note**: If you are using JRF in this sample, substitute `JRF` for each occurrence of `WLS` in the `imagetool` command line below, plus substitute `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4` for the `--fromImage` value.\n+\n+     At this point, we have staged all of the files needed for image `model-in-image:WLS-v2`, they include:\n+\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/weblogic-deploy.zip`\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.yaml`\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.properties`\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip`\n+\n+     If you don't see the `weblogic-deploy.zip` file, then it means that you missed a step in the prerequisites.\n+\n+     Now let's use the Image Tool to create an image named `model-in-image:WLS-v2` that's layered on a base WebLogic image. We've already set up this tool during the prerequisite steps at the beginning of this sample.\n+\n+     Run the following commands to create the model image and verify that it worked:\n+\n+     ```\n+     $ cd /tmp/mii-sample/model-images\n+     $ ./imagetool/bin/imagetool.sh update \\\n+       --tag model-in-image:WLS-v2 \\\n+       --fromImage container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4 \\\n+       --wdtModel      ./model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.yaml \\\n+       --wdtVariables  ./model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.properties \\\n+       --wdtArchive    ./model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip \\\n+       --wdtModelOnly \\\n+       --wdtDomainType WLS\n+     ```\n+\n+     If you don't see the `imagetool` directory, then it means that you missed a step in the prerequisites.\n+\n+     This command runs the WebLogic Image Tool in its Model in Image mode, and does the following:\n+     - Builds the final Docker image as a layer on the `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4` base image.\n+     - Copies the WDT ZIP file that's referenced in the WIT cache into the image.\n+       - Note that we cached WDT in WIT using the keyword `latest` when we set up the cache during the sample prerequisites steps.\n+       - This lets WIT implicitly assume its the desired WDT version and removes the need to pass a `-wdtVersion` flag.\n+     - Copies the specified WDT model, properties, and application archives to image location `/u01/wdt/models`.\n+\n+     When the command succeeds, it should end with output like:\n+\n+     ```\n+     [INFO   ] Build successful. Build time=36s. Image tag=model-in-image:WLS-v2\n+     ```\n+\n+     Also, if you run the `docker images` command, then you should see a Docker image named `model-in-image:WLS-v2`.\n+\n+1.

It does this by:\n+\n+- Using the same image, image model YAML, and application archive as the Initial and Update1 use cases.\n+- Using the same model update ConfigMap source file as the Update1 use case (a data source).\n+- Using a different (unique) domain UID, `sample-domain2`, for the new domain.\n+- Using a different (unique) domain name, `domain2`, for the different domains.\n+- Deploying secrets and a model update ConfigMap that are uniquely labeled and named for the new domain.\n+\n+Note that this use case shows Model in Image's unique ability to quickly deploy a copy of a WebLogic domain that has a different WebLogic domain name and domain encryption key. This is a useful capability that is not supported by the Domain in Image domain home source type:\n+\n+- A Domain in Image domain home source type does not support overriding the domain name, but different domain names are necessary when two domains need to interoperate. In this use case, we take advantage of model macros to ensure that its two different domains have a different domain name: \n+\n+  - First, we define the domain name in the model YAML using the `@@ENV:CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME@@` environment variable macro.\n+  - Second, we set the value of the `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME` environment variable differently using the `env` stanza in each domain's domain resource.\n+\n+- Domain in Image requires that its images embed a WebLogic `security/SerializedSystemIni.dat` domain encryption key that cannot be changed for the image (see [why layering matters]({{< relref \"/userguide/cicd/why-layering-matters.md\" >}}) in CI/CD Considerations). This necessarily means that two Domain in Image domains that share the same image have the ability to decrypt each other's encrypted passwords. A Model in Image's domain encryption key, on the other hand, is not embedded in the image and is instead dynamically and uniquely created each time the domain is started. \n+\n+{{% notice warning %}}\n+Oracle requires interoperating WebLogic domains to have different domain names. This is necessary when two domains communicate, or when a WebLogic Server or WebLogic java client concurrently connects to multiple domains. \n+{{% /notice %}}\n+\n+Here are the steps for this use case:\n+\n+1. Make sure you have deployed the domain from the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case).\n+\n+1. Create a ConfigMap with the WDT model that contains the data source definition.\n+\n+   Run the following commands:\n+\n+   ```\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create configmap sample-domain2-wdt-config-map \\\n+     --from-file=/tmp/mii-sample/model-configmaps/datasource\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label configmap sample-domain2-wdt-config-map \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain2\n+   ```\n+\n+   If you've created your own data source file in the Update1 use case, then substitute the file name in the `--from-file=` parameter (we suggested `/tmp/mii-sample/mydatasource.yaml` earlier). Note that the `-from-file=` parameter can reference a single file, in which case it puts the designated file in the ConfigMap, or it can reference a directory, in which case it populates the ConfigMap with all of the files in the designated directory.\n+\n+   Observations:\n+     - We are leaving the namespace `sample-domain1-ns` unchanged for the ConfigMap because we plan to deploy domain `sample-domain2` to the same namespace as `sample-domain1`.\n+     - We name and label the ConfigMap using its associated domain UID for two reasons:\n+       - To make it obvious which ConfigMap belongs to which domain.\n+       - To make it easier to cleanup a domain. Typical cleanup scripts use the `weblogic.domainUID` label as a convenience for finding all resources associated with a domain.\n+     - We use a different ConfigMap for the new domain for two reasons:\n+       - To make it easier to keep the life-cycle and/or CI/CD process for the two domains simple and independent.

We leave it there to demonstrate that the old version can remain in case you want to revert to it. Once the new image is applied, you can revert by modifying your model's `configuration.model.configMap` to override the related application path in your image model.\n+\n+Here are the steps for this use case:\n+\n+1. Make sure you have deployed the domain from the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case).\n+\n+2. Create an updated image. \n+\n+   Recall that a goal of the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) was to demonstrate using the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image named `model-in-image:WLS-v1` from files that were staged in `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image:WLS-v1/`. The staged files included a web application in a WDT zip archive, and WDT model configuration for a WebLogic Administration Server called `admin-server` and a WebLogic cluster called `cluster-1`. The final image was called `model-in-image:WLS-v1` and, in addition to having a copy of the staged files in its `/u01/wdt/models` directory, also contained a WebLogic installation and a WebLogic Deploy Tooling installation.\n+\n+   In this use case, we will follow similar steps to the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) in order to create a new image with an updated application and model, plus deploy the updated model and application to the running [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case) domain.\n+\n+   - Understanding our updated WDT archive.\n+\n+     The updated archive for this use case is in directory `/tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v2`. We will use it to create an archive ZIP file for the image. This archive is similar to the `/tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v1` from the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) with the the following differences:\n+     - It includes an updated version of the application in `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2` (while keeping the original application in directory `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v1`).\n+     - The application in `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2/myapp_war/index.jsp` contains a single difference with the original application: it changes the line `out.println(\"Hello World! This is version 'v1' of the mii-sample JSP web-app.\");` to `out.println(\"Hello World! This is version 'v2' of the mii-sample JSP web-app.\");`.\n+\n+     For additional information about archives, see the [Understanding our first archive](#understanding-our-first-archive) section in the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) within this sample.\n+\n+   - Stage a ZIP file of the WDT archive.\n+\n+     > **Note**: If you are using JRF in this sample, substitute `JRF` for each occurrence of `WLS` in the paths below.\n+\n+     When we create our updated image, we will use the files in staging directory `/tmp/mii-sample/model-in-image__WLS-v2`. In preparation, we need it to contain a ZIP file of the new WDT application archive.\n+\n+     Run the following commands to create your application archive ZIP file and put it in the expected directory:\n+\n+     ```\n+     # Delete existing archive.zip in case we have an old leftover version\n+     $ rm -f /tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip\n+\n+     # Move to the directory which contains the source files for our new archive\n+     $ cd /tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v2\n+\n+     # Zip the archive to the location will later use when we run the WebLogic Image Tool\n+     $ zip -r /tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip wlsdeploy\n+     ```\n+\n+   - Understanding our staged model files.\n+\n+     The WDT model YAML file and properties for this use case have already been staged for you to directory `/tmp/mii-sample/model-in-image__WLS-v2`. \n+\n+     The `model.10.yaml` file in this directory has an updated path `wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2` that references the updated web application in our archive, but is otherwise identical to the model staged for the original image. The final related YAML stanza looks like this:\n+\n+     ```\n+     appDeployments:\n+         Application:\n+             myapp:\n+                 SourcePath: 'wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2'\n+                 ModuleType: ear\n+                 Target: 'cluster-1'\n+     ```\n+\n+     If you would like to review the entire original model before this change, see [Staging model files](#staging-model-files) in the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) within this sample.\n+\n+   - Create a new image from our staged model files using WIT.\n+\n+     > **Note**: If you are using JRF in this sample, substitute `JRF` for each occurrence of `WLS` in the `imagetool` command line below, plus substitute `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4` for the `--fromImage` value.\n+\n+     At this point, we have staged all of the files needed for image `model-in-image:WLS-v2`, they include:\n+\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/weblogic-deploy.zip`\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.yaml`\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.properties`\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip`\n+\n+     If you don't see the `weblogic-deploy.zip` file, then it means that you missed a step in the prerequisites.\n+\n+     Now let's use the Image Tool to create an image named `model-in-image:WLS-v2` that's layered on a base WebLogic image. We've already set up this tool during the prerequisite steps at the beginning of this sample.\n+\n+     Run the following commands to create the model image and verify that it worked:\n+\n+     ```\n+     $ cd /tmp/mii-sample/model-images\n+     $ ./imagetool/bin/imagetool.sh update \\\n+       --tag model-in-image:WLS-v2 \\\n+       --fromImage container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4 \\\n+       --wdtModel      ./model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.yaml \\\n+       --wdtVariables  ./model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.properties \\\n+       --wdtArchive    ./model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip \\\n+       --wdtModelOnly \\\n+       --wdtDomainType WLS\n+     ```\n+\n+     If you don't see the `imagetool` directory, then it means that you missed a step in the prerequisites.\n+\n+     This command runs the WebLogic Image Tool in its Model in Image mode, and does the following:\n+     - Builds the final Docker image as a layer on the `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4` base image.\n+     - Copies the WDT ZIP file that's referenced in the WIT cache into the image.\n+       - Note that we cached WDT in WIT using the keyword `latest` when we set up the cache during the sample prerequisites steps.\n+       - This lets WIT implicitly assume its the desired WDT version and removes the need to pass a `-wdtVersion` flag.\n+     - Copies the specified WDT model, properties, and application archives to image location `/u01/wdt/models`.\n+\n+     When the command succeeds, it should end with output like:\n+\n+     ```\n+     [INFO   ] Build successful. Build time=36s. Image tag=model-in-image:WLS-v2\n+     ```\n+\n+     Also, if you run the `docker images` command, then you should see a Docker image named `model-in-image:WLS-v2`.\n+\n+1.

It does this by:\n+\n+- Using the same image, image model YAML, and application archive as the Initial and Update1 use cases.\n+- Using the same model update ConfigMap source file as the Update1 use case (a data source).\n+- Using a different (unique) domain UID, `sample-domain2`, for the new domain.\n+- Using a different (unique) domain name, `domain2`, for the different domains.\n+- Deploying secrets and a model update ConfigMap that are uniquely labeled and named for the new domain.\n+\n+Note that this use case shows Model in Image's unique ability to quickly deploy a copy of a WebLogic domain that has a different WebLogic domain name and domain encryption key. This is a useful capability that is not supported by the Domain in Image domain home source type:\n+\n+- A Domain in Image domain home source type does not support overriding the domain name, but different domain names are necessary when two domains need to interoperate. In this use case, we take advantage of model macros to ensure that its two different domains have a different domain name: \n+\n+  - First, we define the domain name in the model YAML using the `@@ENV:CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME@@` environment variable macro.\n+  - Second, we set the value of the `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME` environment variable differently using the `env` stanza in each domain's domain resource.\n+\n+- Domain in Image requires that its images embed a WebLogic `security/SerializedSystemIni.dat` domain encryption key that cannot be changed for the image (see [why layering matters]({{< relref \"/userguide/cicd/why-layering-matters.md\" >}}) in CI/CD Considerations). This necessarily means that two Domain in Image domains that share the same image have the ability to decrypt each other's encrypted passwords. A Model in Image's domain encryption key, on the other hand, is not embedded in the image and is instead dynamically and uniquely created each time the domain is started. \n+\n+{{% notice warning %}}\n+Oracle requires interoperating WebLogic domains to have different domain names. This is necessary when two domains communicate, or when a WebLogic Server or WebLogic java client concurrently connects to multiple domains. \n+{{% /notice %}}\n+\n+Here are the steps for this use case:\n+\n+1. Make sure you have deployed the domain from the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case).\n+\n+1. Create a ConfigMap with the WDT model that contains the data source definition.\n+\n+   Run the following commands:\n+\n+   ```\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create configmap sample-domain2-wdt-config-map \\\n+     --from-file=/tmp/mii-sample/model-configmaps/datasource\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label configmap sample-domain2-wdt-config-map \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain2\n+   ```\n+\n+   If you've created your own data source file in the Update1 use case, then substitute the file name in the `--from-file=` parameter (we suggested `/tmp/mii-sample/mydatasource.yaml` earlier). Note that the `-from-file=` parameter can reference a single file, in which case it puts the designated file in the ConfigMap, or it can reference a directory, in which case it populates the ConfigMap with all of the files in the designated directory.\n+\n+   Observations:\n+     - We are leaving the namespace `sample-domain1-ns` unchanged for the ConfigMap because we plan to deploy domain `sample-domain2` to the same namespace as `sample-domain1`.\n+     - We name and label the ConfigMap using its associated domain UID for two reasons:\n+       - To make it obvious which ConfigMap belongs to which domain.\n+       - To make it easier to cleanup a domain. Typical cleanup scripts use the `weblogic.domainUID` label as a convenience for finding all resources associated with a domain.\n+     - We use a different ConfigMap for the new domain for two reasons:\n+       - To make it easier to keep the life-cycle and/or CI/CD process for the two domains simple and independent. Any shared resources between the two domains must necessarily have their own life-cycle.\n+       - To 'future proof' the new domain so that changes to the original domain or new domain's ConfigMap can be independent.\n+\n+\n+1. Create the secrets that are referenced by the WDT model files in the image and ConfigMap, and that will be referenced by the domain resource.\n+\n+   Run the following commands:\n+   ```\n+   $ # spec.webLogicCredentialsSecret\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create secret generic \\\n+     sample-domain2-weblogic-credentials \\\n+      --from-literal=username=weblogic --from-literal=password=welcome1\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label  secret \\\n+     sample-domain2-weblogic-credentials \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain2\n+\n+   $ # spec.configuration.model.runtimeEncryptionSecret\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create secret generic \\\n+     sample-domain2-runtime-encryption-secret \\\n+      --from-literal=password=my_runtime_password\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label  secret \\\n+     sample-domain2-runtime-encryption-secret \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain2\n+\n+   $ # referenced by spec.configuration.secrets and by the datasource model YAML in the ConfigMap\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create secret generic \\\n+     sample-domain2-datasource-secret \\\n+      --from-literal=password=Oradoc_db1 \\\n+      --from-literal=url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label  secret \\\n+     sample-domain2-datasource-secret \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain2\n+   ```\n+\n+   Observations:\n+     - We are leaving the namespace `sample-domain1-ns` unchanged for each secret because we plan to deploy domain `sample-domain2` to the same namespace as `sample-domain1`.\n+     - We name and label the secrets using their associated domain UID for two reasons:\n+       - To make it obvious which secret belongs to which domain.\n+       - To make it easier to cleanup a domain.

We leave it there to demonstrate that the old version can remain in case you want to revert to it. Once the new image is applied, you can revert by modifying your model's `configuration.model.configMap` to override the related application path in your image model.\n+\n+Here are the steps for this use case:\n+\n+1. Make sure you have deployed the domain from the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case).\n+\n+2. Create an updated image. \n+\n+   Recall that a goal of the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) was to demonstrate using the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image named `model-in-image:WLS-v1` from files that were staged in `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image:WLS-v1/`. The staged files included a web application in a WDT zip archive, and WDT model configuration for a WebLogic Administration Server called `admin-server` and a WebLogic cluster called `cluster-1`. The final image was called `model-in-image:WLS-v1` and, in addition to having a copy of the staged files in its `/u01/wdt/models` directory, also contained a WebLogic installation and a WebLogic Deploy Tooling installation.\n+\n+   In this use case, we will follow similar steps to the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) in order to create a new image with an updated application and model, plus deploy the updated model and application to the running [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case) domain.\n+\n+   - Understanding our updated WDT archive.\n+\n+     The updated archive for this use case is in directory `/tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v2`. We will use it to create an archive ZIP file for the image. This archive is similar to the `/tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v1` from the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) with the the following differences:\n+     - It includes an updated version of the application in `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2` (while keeping the original application in directory `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v1`).\n+     - The application in `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2/myapp_war/index.jsp` contains a single difference with the original application: it changes the line `out.println(\"Hello World! This is version 'v1' of the mii-sample JSP web-app.\");` to `out.println(\"Hello World! This is version 'v2' of the mii-sample JSP web-app.\");`.\n+\n+     For additional information about archives, see the [Understanding our first archive](#understanding-our-first-archive) section in the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) within this sample.\n+\n+   - Stage a ZIP file of the WDT archive.\n+\n+     > **Note**: If you are using JRF in this sample, substitute `JRF` for each occurrence of `WLS` in the paths below.\n+\n+     When we create our updated image, we will use the files in staging directory `/tmp/mii-sample/model-in-image__WLS-v2`. In preparation, we need it to contain a ZIP file of the new WDT application archive.\n+\n+     Run the following commands to create your application archive ZIP file and put it in the expected directory:\n+\n+     ```\n+     # Delete existing archive.zip in case we have an old leftover version\n+     $ rm -f /tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip\n+\n+     # Move to the directory which contains the source files for our new archive\n+     $ cd /tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v2\n+\n+     # Zip the archive to the location will later use when we run the WebLogic Image Tool\n+     $ zip -r /tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip wlsdeploy\n+     ```\n+\n+   - Understanding our staged model files.\n+\n+     The WDT model YAML file and properties for this use case have already been staged for you to directory `/tmp/mii-sample/model-in-image__WLS-v2`. \n+\n+     The `model.10.yaml` file in this directory has an updated path `wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2` that references the updated web application in our archive, but is otherwise identical to the model staged for the original image. The final related YAML stanza looks like this:\n+\n+     ```\n+     appDeployments:\n+         Application:\n+             myapp:\n+                 SourcePath: 'wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2'\n+                 ModuleType: ear\n+                 Target: 'cluster-1'\n+     ```\n+\n+     If you would like to review the entire original model before this change, see [Staging model files](#staging-model-files) in the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) within this sample.\n+\n+   - Create a new image from our staged model files using WIT.\n+\n+     > **Note**: If you are using JRF in this sample, substitute `JRF` for each occurrence of `WLS` in the `imagetool` command line below, plus substitute `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4` for the `--fromImage` value.\n+\n+     At this point, we have staged all of the files needed for image `model-in-image:WLS-v2`, they include:\n+\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/weblogic-deploy.zip`\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.yaml`\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.properties`\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip`\n+\n+     If you don't see the `weblogic-deploy.zip` file, then it means that you missed a step in the prerequisites.\n+\n+     Now let's use the Image Tool to create an image named `model-in-image:WLS-v2` that's layered on a base WebLogic image. We've already set up this tool during the prerequisite steps at the beginning of this sample.\n+\n+     Run the following commands to create the model image and verify that it worked:\n+\n+     ```\n+     $ cd /tmp/mii-sample/model-images\n+     $ ./imagetool/bin/imagetool.sh update \\\n+       --tag model-in-image:WLS-v2 \\\n+       --fromImage container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4 \\\n+       --wdtModel      ./model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.yaml \\\n+       --wdtVariables  ./model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.properties \\\n+       --wdtArchive    ./model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip \\\n+       --wdtModelOnly \\\n+       --wdtDomainType WLS\n+     ```\n+\n+     If you don't see the `imagetool` directory, then it means that you missed a step in the prerequisites.\n+\n+     This command runs the WebLogic Image Tool in its Model in Image mode, and does the following:\n+     - Builds the final Docker image as a layer on the `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4` base image.\n+     - Copies the WDT ZIP file that's referenced in the WIT cache into the image.\n+       - Note that we cached WDT in WIT using the keyword `latest` when we set up the cache during the sample prerequisites steps.\n+       - This lets WIT implicitly assume its the desired WDT version and removes the need to pass a `-wdtVersion` flag.\n+     - Copies the specified WDT model, properties, and application archives to image location `/u01/wdt/models`.\n+\n+     When the command succeeds, it should end with output like:\n+\n+     ```\n+     [INFO   ] Build successful. Build time=36s. Image tag=model-in-image:WLS-v2\n+     ```\n+\n+     Also, if you run the `docker images` command, then you should see a Docker image named `model-in-image:WLS-v2`.\n+\n+1. Set up and apply a domain resource that is similar to your \"Update1\" use case domain resource but with a different image:\n+\n+   > **Note**: If you are using JRF in this sample, substitute `JRF` for each occurrence of `WLS` in the paths, files, and image names below.\n+\n+   - Option 1: Update a copy of your domain resource file from the \"Update1\" use case.\n+\n+     - You might recall that in the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case) we suggested creating a file named `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-update1.yaml` or using the `/tmp/mii-sample/domain-resources/WLS/mii-update1-d1-WLS-v1-ds.yaml` file that comes supplied with the sample.\n+\n+       - We suggest copying this domain resource file and naming the copy `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-update3.yaml` before making any changes.\n+\n+       - Working on a copy is not strictly necessary, but it helps to keep track of your work for the different use cases in this sample and also provides you a backup of your previous work.\n+\n+     - Change the `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-update3.yaml` domain resource `image` field to reference `model-in-image:WLS-v2` instead of `model-in-image:WLS-v1`.\n+\n+        The final result should look something like this:\n+\n+        ```\n+        ...\n+        spec:\n+          ...\n+          image: \"model-in-image:WLS-v2\"\n+        ```\n+\n+      - Apply your changed domain resource:\n+\n+          ```\n+          $ kubectl apply -f /tmp/mii-sample/mii-update3.yaml\n+          ```\n+\n+    - Option 2: Use the updated domain resource file that is supplied with the sample:\n+\n+        ```\n+        $ kubectl apply -f /tmp/miisample/domain-resources/WLS/mii-update3-d1-WLS-v2-ds.yaml\n+        ```\n+\n+\n+1. Wait for the roll to complete.\n+\n+   Now that you've applied a domain resource with an updated image, the operator should automatically rerun the domain's introspector job in order to generate a new domain home, and then should restart ('roll') each of the domain's pods so that they use the new domain home and the new image. You'll need to wait for this roll to complete before we can verify that the new image and its associated new application have been deployed.\n+\n+   - One way to do this is to call `kubectl get pods -n sample-domain1-ns --watch` and wait for the pods to cycle back to their `ready` state.\n+\n+   - Alternatively, you can run `/tmp/mii-sample/utils/wl-pod-wait.sh -p 3`. This is a utility script that provides useful information about a domain's pods and waits for them to reach a `ready` state, reach their target `restartVersion`, and reach their target `image` before exiting.\n+\n+     {{%expand \"Click here to expand the `wl-pod-wait.sh` usage.\" %}}\n+   ```\n+     $ ./wl-pod-wait.sh -?\n \n+       Usage:\n+\n+         wl-pod-wait.sh [-n mynamespace] [-d mydomainuid] \\\n+            [-p expected_pod_count] \\\n+            [-t timeout_secs] \\\n+            [-q]\n+\n+         Exits non-zero if 'timeout_secs' is reached before 'pod_count' is reached.\n+\n+       Parameters:\n+\n+         -d <domain_uid> : Defaults to 'sample-domain1'.\n+\n+         -n <namespace>  : Defaults to 'sample-domain1-ns'.\n+\n+         pod_count > 0   : Wait until exactly 'pod_count' WebLogic server pods for\n+                           a domain all (a) are ready, (b) have the same\n+                           'domainRestartVersion' label value as the\n+                           current domain resource's 'spec.restartVersion, and\n+                           (c) have the same image as the current domain\n+                           resource's image.\n+\n+         pod_count = 0   : Wait until there are no running WebLogic server pods\n+                           for a domain.

It does this by:\n+\n+- Using the same image, image model YAML, and application archive as the Initial and Update1 use cases.\n+- Using the same model update ConfigMap source file as the Update1 use case (a data source).\n+- Using a different (unique) domain UID, `sample-domain2`, for the new domain.\n+- Using a different (unique) domain name, `domain2`, for the different domains.\n+- Deploying secrets and a model update ConfigMap that are uniquely labeled and named for the new domain.\n+\n+Note that this use case shows Model in Image's unique ability to quickly deploy a copy of a WebLogic domain that has a different WebLogic domain name and domain encryption key. This is a useful capability that is not supported by the Domain in Image domain home source type:\n+\n+- A Domain in Image domain home source type does not support overriding the domain name, but different domain names are necessary when two domains need to interoperate. In this use case, we take advantage of model macros to ensure that its two different domains have a different domain name: \n+\n+  - First, we define the domain name in the model YAML using the `@@ENV:CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME@@` environment variable macro.\n+  - Second, we set the value of the `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME` environment variable differently using the `env` stanza in each domain's domain resource.\n+\n+- Domain in Image requires that its images embed a WebLogic `security/SerializedSystemIni.dat` domain encryption key that cannot be changed for the image (see [why layering matters]({{< relref \"/userguide/cicd/why-layering-matters.md\" >}}) in CI/CD Considerations). This necessarily means that two Domain in Image domains that share the same image have the ability to decrypt each other's encrypted passwords. A Model in Image's domain encryption key, on the other hand, is not embedded in the image and is instead dynamically and uniquely created each time the domain is started. \n+\n+{{% notice warning %}}\n+Oracle requires interoperating WebLogic domains to have different domain names. This is necessary when two domains communicate, or when a WebLogic Server or WebLogic java client concurrently connects to multiple domains. \n+{{% /notice %}}\n+\n+Here are the steps for this use case:\n+\n+1. Make sure you have deployed the domain from the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case).\n+\n+1. Create a ConfigMap with the WDT model that contains the data source definition.\n+\n+   Run the following commands:\n+\n+   ```\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create configmap sample-domain2-wdt-config-map \\\n+     --from-file=/tmp/mii-sample/model-configmaps/datasource\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label configmap sample-domain2-wdt-config-map \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain2\n+   ```\n+\n+   If you've created your own data source file in the Update1 use case, then substitute the file name in the `--from-file=` parameter (we suggested `/tmp/mii-sample/mydatasource.yaml` earlier). Note that the `-from-file=` parameter can reference a single file, in which case it puts the designated file in the ConfigMap, or it can reference a directory, in which case it populates the ConfigMap with all of the files in the designated directory.\n+\n+   Observations:\n+     - We are leaving the namespace `sample-domain1-ns` unchanged for the ConfigMap because we plan to deploy domain `sample-domain2` to the same namespace as `sample-domain1`.\n+     - We name and label the ConfigMap using its associated domain UID for two reasons:\n+       - To make it obvious which ConfigMap belongs to which domain.\n+       - To make it easier to cleanup a domain. Typical cleanup scripts use the `weblogic.domainUID` label as a convenience for finding all resources associated with a domain.\n+     - We use a different ConfigMap for the new domain for two reasons:\n+       - To make it easier to keep the life-cycle and/or CI/CD process for the two domains simple and independent. Any shared resources between the two domains must necessarily have their own life-cycle.\n+       - To 'future proof' the new domain so that changes to the original domain or new domain's ConfigMap can be independent.\n+\n+\n+1.

We leave it there to demonstrate that the old version can remain in case you want to revert to it. Once the new image is applied, you can revert by modifying your model's `configuration.model.configMap` to override the related application path in your image model.\n+\n+Here are the steps for this use case:\n+\n+1. Make sure you have deployed the domain from the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case).\n+\n+2. Create an updated image. \n+\n+   Recall that a goal of the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) was to demonstrate using the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image named `model-in-image:WLS-v1` from files that were staged in `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image:WLS-v1/`. The staged files included a web application in a WDT zip archive, and WDT model configuration for a WebLogic Administration Server called `admin-server` and a WebLogic cluster called `cluster-1`. The final image was called `model-in-image:WLS-v1` and, in addition to having a copy of the staged files in its `/u01/wdt/models` directory, also contained a WebLogic installation and a WebLogic Deploy Tooling installation.\n+\n+   In this use case, we will follow similar steps to the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) in order to create a new image with an updated application and model, plus deploy the updated model and application to the running [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case) domain.\n+\n+   - Understanding our updated WDT archive.\n+\n+     The updated archive for this use case is in directory `/tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v2`. We will use it to create an archive ZIP file for the image. This archive is similar to the `/tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v1` from the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) with the the following differences:\n+     - It includes an updated version of the application in `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2` (while keeping the original application in directory `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v1`).\n+     - The application in `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2/myapp_war/index.jsp` contains a single difference with the original application: it changes the line `out.println(\"Hello World! This is version 'v1' of the mii-sample JSP web-app.\");` to `out.println(\"Hello World! This is version 'v2' of the mii-sample JSP web-app.\");`.\n+\n+     For additional information about archives, see the [Understanding our first archive](#understanding-our-first-archive) section in the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) within this sample.\n+\n+   - Stage a ZIP file of the WDT archive.\n+\n+     > **Note**: If you are using JRF in this sample, substitute `JRF` for each occurrence of `WLS` in the paths below.\n+\n+     When we create our updated image, we will use the files in staging directory `/tmp/mii-sample/model-in-image__WLS-v2`. In preparation, we need it to contain a ZIP file of the new WDT application archive.\n+\n+     Run the following commands to create your application archive ZIP file and put it in the expected directory:\n+\n+     ```\n+     # Delete existing archive.zip in case we have an old leftover version\n+     $ rm -f /tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip\n+\n+     # Move to the directory which contains the source files for our new archive\n+     $ cd /tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v2\n+\n+     # Zip the archive to the location will later use when we run the WebLogic Image Tool\n+     $ zip -r /tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip wlsdeploy\n+     ```\n+\n+   - Understanding our staged model files.\n+\n+     The WDT model YAML file and properties for this use case have already been staged for you to directory `/tmp/mii-sample/model-in-image__WLS-v2`. \n+\n+     The `model.10.yaml` file in this directory has an updated path `wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2` that references the updated web application in our archive, but is otherwise identical to the model staged for the original image. The final related YAML stanza looks like this:\n+\n+     ```\n+     appDeployments:\n+         Application:\n+             myapp:\n+                 SourcePath: 'wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2'\n+                 ModuleType: ear\n+                 Target: 'cluster-1'\n+     ```\n+\n+     If you would like to review the entire original model before this change, see [Staging model files](#staging-model-files) in the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) within this sample.\n+\n+   - Create a new image from our staged model files using WIT.\n+\n+     > **Note**: If you are using JRF in this sample, substitute `JRF` for each occurrence of `WLS` in the `imagetool` command line below, plus substitute `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4` for the `--fromImage` value.\n+\n+     At this point, we have staged all of the files needed for image `model-in-image:WLS-v2`, they include:\n+\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/weblogic-deploy.zip`\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.yaml`\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.properties`\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip`\n+\n+     If you don't see the `weblogic-deploy.zip` file, then it means that you missed a step in the prerequisites.\n+\n+     Now let's use the Image Tool to create an image named `model-in-image:WLS-v2` that's layered on a base WebLogic image. We've already set up this tool during the prerequisite steps at the beginning of this sample.\n+\n+     Run the following commands to create the model image and verify that it worked:\n+\n+     ```\n+     $ cd /tmp/mii-sample/model-images\n+     $ ./imagetool/bin/imagetool.sh update \\\n+       --tag model-in-image:WLS-v2 \\\n+       --fromImage container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4 \\\n+       --wdtModel      ./model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.yaml \\\n+       --wdtVariables  ./model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.properties \\\n+       --wdtArchive    ./model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip \\\n+       --wdtModelOnly \\\n+       --wdtDomainType WLS\n+     ```\n+\n+     If you don't see the `imagetool` directory, then it means that you missed a step in the prerequisites.\n+\n+     This command runs the WebLogic Image Tool in its Model in Image mode, and does the following:\n+     - Builds the final Docker image as a layer on the `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4` base image.\n+     - Copies the WDT ZIP file that's referenced in the WIT cache into the image.\n+       - Note that we cached WDT in WIT using the keyword `latest` when we set up the cache during the sample prerequisites steps.\n+       - This lets WIT implicitly assume its the desired WDT version and removes the need to pass a `-wdtVersion` flag.\n+     - Copies the specified WDT model, properties, and application archives to image location `/u01/wdt/models`.\n+\n+     When the command succeeds, it should end with output like:\n+\n+     ```\n+     [INFO   ] Build successful. Build time=36s. Image tag=model-in-image:WLS-v2\n+     ```\n+\n+     Also, if you run the `docker images` command, then you should see a Docker image named `model-in-image:WLS-v2`.\n+\n+1. Set up and apply a domain resource that is similar to your \"Update1\" use case domain resource but with a different image:\n+\n+   > **Note**: If you are using JRF in this sample, substitute `JRF` for each occurrence of `WLS` in the paths, files, and image names below.\n+\n+   - Option 1: Update a copy of your domain resource file from the \"Update1\" use case.\n+\n+     - You might recall that in the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case) we suggested creating a file named `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-update1.yaml` or using the `/tmp/mii-sample/domain-resources/WLS/mii-update1-d1-WLS-v1-ds.yaml` file that comes supplied with the sample.\n+\n+       - We suggest copying this domain resource file and naming the copy `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-update3.yaml` before making any changes.\n+\n+       - Working on a copy is not strictly necessary, but it helps to keep track of your work for the different use cases in this sample and also provides you a backup of your previous work.\n+\n+     - Change the `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-update3.yaml` domain resource `image` field to reference `model-in-image:WLS-v2` instead of `model-in-image:WLS-v1`.\n+\n+        The final result should look something like this:\n+\n+        ```\n+        ...\n+        spec:\n+          ...\n+          image: \"model-in-image:WLS-v2\"\n+        ```\n+\n+      - Apply your changed domain resource:\n+\n+          ```\n+          $ kubectl apply -f /tmp/mii-sample/mii-update3.yaml\n+          ```\n+\n+    - Option 2: Use the updated domain resource file that is supplied with the sample:\n+\n+        ```\n+        $ kubectl apply -f /tmp/miisample/domain-resources/WLS/mii-update3-d1-WLS-v2-ds.yaml\n+        ```\n+\n+\n+1. Wait for the roll to complete.\n+\n+   Now that you've applied a domain resource with an updated image, the operator should automatically rerun the domain's introspector job in order to generate a new domain home, and then should restart ('roll') each of the domain's pods so that they use the new domain home and the new image. You'll need to wait for this roll to complete before we can verify that the new image and its associated new application have been deployed.\n+\n+   - One way to do this is to call `kubectl get pods -n sample-domain1-ns --watch` and wait for the pods to cycle back to their `ready` state.\n+\n+   - Alternatively, you can run `/tmp/mii-sample/utils/wl-pod-wait.sh -p 3`. This is a utility script that provides useful information about a domain's pods and waits for them to reach a `ready` state, reach their target `restartVersion`, and reach their target `image` before exiting.\n+\n+     {{%expand \"Click here to expand the `wl-pod-wait.sh` usage.\" %}}\n+   ```\n+     $ ./wl-pod-wait.sh -?\n \n+       Usage:\n+\n+         wl-pod-wait.sh [-n mynamespace] [-d mydomainuid] \\\n+            [-p expected_pod_count] \\\n+            [-t timeout_secs] \\\n+            [-q]\n+\n+         Exits non-zero if 'timeout_secs' is reached before 'pod_count' is reached.\n+\n+       Parameters:\n+\n+         -d <domain_uid> : Defaults to 'sample-domain1'.\n+\n+         -n <namespace>  : Defaults to 'sample-domain1-ns'.\n+\n+         pod_count > 0   : Wait until exactly 'pod_count' WebLogic server pods for\n+                           a domain all (a) are ready, (b) have the same\n+                           'domainRestartVersion' label value as the\n+                           current domain resource's 'spec.restartVersion, and\n+                           (c) have the same image as the current domain\n+                           resource's image.\n+\n+         pod_count = 0   : Wait until there are no running WebLogic server pods\n+                           for a domain.

It does this by:\n+\n+- Using the same image, image model YAML, and application archive as the Initial and Update1 use cases.\n+- Using the same model update ConfigMap source file as the Update1 use case (a data source).\n+- Using a different (unique) domain UID, `sample-domain2`, for the new domain.\n+- Using a different (unique) domain name, `domain2`, for the different domains.\n+- Deploying secrets and a model update ConfigMap that are uniquely labeled and named for the new domain.\n+\n+Note that this use case shows Model in Image's unique ability to quickly deploy a copy of a WebLogic domain that has a different WebLogic domain name and domain encryption key. This is a useful capability that is not supported by the Domain in Image domain home source type:\n+\n+- A Domain in Image domain home source type does not support overriding the domain name, but different domain names are necessary when two domains need to interoperate. In this use case, we take advantage of model macros to ensure that its two different domains have a different domain name: \n+\n+  - First, we define the domain name in the model YAML using the `@@ENV:CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME@@` environment variable macro.\n+  - Second, we set the value of the `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME` environment variable differently using the `env` stanza in each domain's domain resource.\n+\n+- Domain in Image requires that its images embed a WebLogic `security/SerializedSystemIni.dat` domain encryption key that cannot be changed for the image (see [why layering matters]({{< relref \"/userguide/cicd/why-layering-matters.md\" >}}) in CI/CD Considerations). This necessarily means that two Domain in Image domains that share the same image have the ability to decrypt each other's encrypted passwords.

Note that the `-from-file=` parameter can reference a single file, in which case it puts the designated file in the ConfigMap, or it can reference a directory, in which case it populates the ConfigMap with all of the files in the designated directory.\n+\n+   Observations:\n+     - We are leaving the namespace `sample-domain1-ns` unchanged for the ConfigMap because we plan to deploy domain `sample-domain2` to the same namespace as `sample-domain1`.\n+     - We name and label the ConfigMap using its associated domain UID for two reasons:\n+       - To make it obvious which ConfigMap belongs to which domain.\n+       - To make it easier to cleanup a domain.

Set up a domain resource that is similar to your \"Update1\" use case domain resource but with different domain UID, domain name, model update ConfigMap reference, and secret references:\n+\n+    - Option 1: Update a copy of your domain resource file from the \"Update1\" use case.\n+\n+      - You might recall that in the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case) we suggested creating a file named `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-update1.yaml` or using the `/tmp/mii-sample/domain-resources/WLS/mii-update1-d1-WLS-v1-ds.yaml` file that comes supplied with the sample.\n+        - We suggest copying this domain resource file and naming the copy `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-update2.yaml` before making any changes.\n+\n+        - Working on a copy is not strictly necessary, but it helps to keep track of your work for the different use cases in this sample and also provides you a backup of your previous work.\n+\n+      - Change the `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-update2.yaml` domain resource name and `weblogic.domainUID` label to `sample-domain2`.\n+\n+        The final result should look something like this:\n+\n+          ``` \n+          apiVersion: \"weblogic.oracle/v7\"\n+          kind: Domain\n+          metadata:\n+            name: sample-domain2\n+            namespace: sample-domain1-ns\n+            labels:\n+              weblogic.resourceVersion: domain-v2\n+              weblogic.domainUID: sample-domain2\n+          ```\n+\n+        > __NOTE__: We are leaving the namespace `sample-domain1-ns` unchanged because we will be deploying domain `sample-domain2` to the same namespace as `sample-domain1`.\n+\n+      - Change the `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-update2.yaml` domain resource's `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME` environment variable from `domain1` to `domain2`.\n+\n+        The model file in the image uses macro `@@ENV:CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME@@` to reference this environment variable when setting its domain name. \n+\n+        Specifically, change the corresponding domain resource `spec.serverPod.env` YAML stanza to look something like this:\n+\n+        ```\n+        ...\n+        spec:\n+          ...\n+          serverPod:\n+          ...\n+            env:\n+            - name: CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME\n+              value: \"domain2\"\n+          ...\n+        ```\n+\n+      - Change the `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-update2.yaml` domain resource `spec.domainHome` value to `/u01/domains/sample-domain2`.

This is a useful capability that is not supported by the Domain in Image domain home source type:\n+\n+- A Domain in Image domain home source type does not support overriding the domain name, but different domain names are necessary when two domains need to interoperate. In this use case, we take advantage of model macros to ensure that its two different domains have a different domain name: \n+\n+  - First, we define the domain name in the model YAML using the `@@ENV:CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME@@` environment variable macro.\n+  - Second, we set the value of the `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME` environment variable differently using the `env` stanza in each domain's domain resource.\n+\n+- Domain in Image requires that its images embed a WebLogic `security/SerializedSystemIni.dat` domain encryption key that cannot be changed for the image (see [why layering matters]({{< relref \"/userguide/cicd/why-layering-matters.md\" >}}) in CI/CD Considerations). This necessarily means that two Domain in Image domains that share the same image have the ability to decrypt each other's encrypted passwords.

Make sure you have deployed the domain from the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case).\n+\n+1.

Note that the `-from-file=` parameter can reference a single file, in which case it puts the designated file in the ConfigMap, or it can reference a directory, in which case it populates the ConfigMap with all of the files in the designated directory.\n+\n+   Observations:\n+     - We are leaving the namespace `sample-domain1-ns` unchanged for the ConfigMap because we plan to deploy domain `sample-domain2` to the same namespace as `sample-domain1`.\n+     - We name and label the ConfigMap using its associated domain UID for two reasons:\n+       - To make it obvious which ConfigMap belongs to which domain.\n+       - To make it easier to cleanup a domain.

Any shared resources between the two domains must necessarily have their own life-cycle.\n+       - To 'future proof' the new domain so that changes to the original domain or new domain's ConfigMap can be independent.\n+\n+\n+1.

This is a useful capability that is not supported by the Domain in Image domain home source type:\n+\n+- A Domain in Image domain home source type does not support overriding the domain name, but different domain names are necessary when two domains need to interoperate. In this use case, we take advantage of model macros to ensure that its two different domains have a different domain name: \n+\n+  - First, we define the domain name in the model YAML using the `@@ENV:CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME@@` environment variable macro.\n+  - Second, we set the value of the `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME` environment variable differently using the `env` stanza in each domain's domain resource.\n+\n+- Domain in Image requires that its images embed a WebLogic `security/SerializedSystemIni.dat` domain encryption key that cannot be changed for the image (see [why layering matters]({{< relref \"/userguide/cicd/why-layering-matters.md\" >}}) in CI/CD Considerations). This necessarily means that two Domain in Image domains that share the same image have the ability to decrypt each other's encrypted passwords.

It does this by:\n+\n+- Using the same image, image model YAML, and application archive as the Initial and Update1 use cases.\n+- Using the same model update ConfigMap source file as the Update1 use case (a data source).\n+- Using a different (unique) domain UID, `sample-domain2`, for the new domain.\n+- Using a different (unique) domain name, `domain2`, for the different domains.\n+- Deploying secrets and a model update ConfigMap that are uniquely labeled and named for the new domain.\n+\n+Note that this use case shows Model in Image's unique ability to quickly deploy a copy of a WebLogic domain that has a different WebLogic domain name and domain encryption key. This is a useful capability that is not supported by the Domain in Image domain home source type:\n+\n+- A Domain in Image domain home source type does not support overriding the domain name, but different domain names are necessary when two domains need to interoperate. In this use case, we take advantage of model macros to ensure that its two different domains have a different domain name: \n+\n+  - First, we define the domain name in the model YAML using the `@@ENV:CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME@@` environment variable macro.\n+  - Second, we set the value of the `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME` environment variable differently using the `env` stanza in each domain's domain resource.\n+\n+- Domain in Image requires that its images embed a WebLogic `security/SerializedSystemIni.dat` domain encryption key that cannot be changed for the image (see [why layering matters]({{< relref \"/userguide/cicd/why-layering-matters.md\" >}}) in CI/CD Considerations). This necessarily means that two Domain in Image domains that share the same image have the ability to decrypt each other's encrypted passwords. A Model in Image's domain encryption key, on the other hand, is not embedded in the image and instead, is dynamically and uniquely created each time the domain is started. \n+\n+{{% notice warning %}}\n+Oracle requires interoperating WebLogic domains to have different domain names. This is necessary when two domains communicate, or when a WebLogic Server or WebLogic Java client concurrently connects to multiple domains. \n+{{% /notice %}}\n+\n+Here are the steps for this use case:\n+\n+1. Make sure you have deployed the domain from the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case).\n+\n+1. Create a ConfigMap with the WDT model that contains the data source definition.\n+\n+   Run the following commands:\n+\n+   ```\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create configmap sample-domain2-wdt-config-map \\\n+     --from-file=/tmp/mii-sample/model-configmaps/datasource\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label configmap sample-domain2-wdt-config-map \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain2\n+   ```\n+\n+   If you've created your own data source file in the Update1 use case, then substitute the file name in the `--from-file=` parameter (we suggested `/tmp/mii-sample/mydatasource.yaml` earlier). Note that the `-from-file=` parameter can reference a single file, in which case it puts the designated file in the ConfigMap, or it can reference a directory, in which case it populates the ConfigMap with all of the files in the designated directory.\n+\n+   Observations:\n+     - We are leaving the namespace `sample-domain1-ns` unchanged for the ConfigMap because we plan to deploy domain `sample-domain2` to the same namespace as `sample-domain1`.\n+     - We name and label the ConfigMap using its associated domain UID for two reasons:\n+       - To make it obvious which ConfigMap belongs to which domain.\n+       - To make it easier to clean up a domain. Typical cleanup scripts use the `weblogic.domainUID` label as a convenience for finding all resources associated with a domain.\n+     - We use a different ConfigMap for the new domain for two reasons:\n+       - To make it easier to keep the life cycle and/or CI/CD process for the two domains simple and independent.\n+       - To 'future proof' the new domain so that changes to the original domain or new domain's ConfigMap can be independent.\n+\n+\n+1.

scenarios.\n+If you plan to run the [Update3 use case](#update3-use-case), then leave your domain running.\n+\n+### Update2 use case\n+\n+This use case demonstrates concurrently deploying a domain that is similar to the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case) domain to the same `sample-domain1-ns` namespace but with a different domain UID, a different WebLogic domain name, and a different WebLogic domain encryption key. It does this by:\n+\n+- Using the same image, image model YAML, and application archive as the Initial and Update1 use cases.\n+- Using the same model update ConfigMap source file as the Update1 use case (a data source).\n+- Using a different (unique) domain UID, `sample-domain2`, for the new domain.\n+- Using a different (unique) domain name, `domain2`, for the different domains.\n+- Deploying secrets and a model update ConfigMap that are uniquely labeled and named for the new domain.\n+\n+Note that this use case shows Model in Image's unique ability to quickly deploy a copy of a WebLogic domain that has a different WebLogic domain name and domain encryption key. This is a useful capability that is not supported by the Domain in Image domain home source type:\n+\n+- A Domain in Image domain home source type does not support overriding the domain name, but different domain names are necessary when two domains need to interoperate. In this use case, we take advantage of model macros to ensure that its two different domains have a different domain name: \n+\n+  - First, we define the domain name in the model YAML using the `@@ENV:CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME@@` environment variable macro.\n+  - Second, we set the value of the `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME` environment variable differently using the `env` stanza in each domain's domain resource.\n+\n+- Domain in Image requires that its images embed a WebLogic `security/SerializedSystemIni.dat` domain encryption key that cannot be changed for the image (see [why layering matters]({{< relref \"/userguide/cicd/why-layering-matters.md\" >}}) in CI/CD Considerations). This necessarily means that two Domain in Image domains that share the same image have the ability to decrypt each other's encrypted passwords. A Model in Image's domain encryption key, on the other hand, is not embedded in the image and instead, is dynamically and uniquely created each time the domain is started. \n+\n+{{% notice warning %}}\n+Oracle requires interoperating WebLogic domains to have different domain names.

Note that the `-from-file=` parameter can reference a single file, in which case it puts the designated file in the ConfigMap, or it can reference a directory, in which case it populates the ConfigMap with all of the files in the designated directory.\n+\n+   Observations:\n+     - We are leaving the namespace `sample-domain1-ns` unchanged for the ConfigMap because we plan to deploy domain `sample-domain2` to the same namespace as `sample-domain1`.\n+     - We name and label the ConfigMap using its associated domain UID for two reasons:\n+       - To make it obvious which ConfigMap belongs to which domain.\n+       - To make it easier to clean up a domain.

scenarios.\n+If you plan to run the [Update3 use case](#update3-use-case), then leave your domain running.\n+\n+### Update2 use case\n+\n+This use case demonstrates concurrently deploying a domain that is similar to the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case) domain to the same `sample-domain1-ns` namespace but with a different domain UID, a different WebLogic domain name, and a different WebLogic domain encryption key. It does this by:\n+\n+- Using the same image, image model YAML, and application archive as the Initial and Update1 use cases.\n+- Using the same model update ConfigMap source file as the Update1 use case (a data source).\n+- Using a different (unique) domain UID, `sample-domain2`, for the new domain.\n+- Using a different (unique) domain name, `domain2`, for the different domains.\n+- Deploying secrets and a model update ConfigMap that are uniquely labeled and named for the new domain.\n+\n+Note that this use case shows Model in Image's unique ability to quickly deploy a copy of a WebLogic domain that has a different WebLogic domain name and domain encryption key. This is a useful capability that is not supported by the Domain in Image domain home source type:\n+\n+- A Domain in Image domain home source type does not support overriding the domain name, but different domain names are necessary when two domains need to interoperate. In this use case, we take advantage of model macros to ensure that its two different domains have a different domain name: \n+\n+  - First, we define the domain name in the model YAML using the `@@ENV:CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME@@` environment variable macro.\n+  - Second, we set the value of the `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME` environment variable differently using the `env` stanza in each domain's domain resource.\n+\n+- Domain in Image requires that its images embed a WebLogic `security/SerializedSystemIni.dat` domain encryption key that cannot be changed for the image (see [why layering matters]({{< relref \"/userguide/cicd/why-layering-matters.md\" >}}) in CI/CD Considerations). This necessarily means that two Domain in Image domains that share the same image have the ability to decrypt each other's encrypted passwords. A Model in Image's domain encryption key, on the other hand, is not embedded in the image and instead, is dynamically and uniquely created each time the domain is started. \n+\n+{{% notice warning %}}\n+Oracle requires interoperating WebLogic domains to have different domain names. This is necessary when two domains communicate, or when a WebLogic Server or WebLogic Java client concurrently connects to multiple domains. \n+{{% /notice %}}\n+\n+Here are the steps for this use case:\n+\n+1. Make sure you have deployed the domain from the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case).\n+\n+1. Create a ConfigMap with the WDT model that contains the data source definition.\n+\n+   Run the following commands:\n+\n+   ```\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create configmap sample-domain2-wdt-config-map \\\n+     --from-file=/tmp/mii-sample/model-configmaps/datasource\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label configmap sample-domain2-wdt-config-map \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain2\n+   ```\n+\n+   If you've created your own data source file in the Update1 use case, then substitute the file name in the `--from-file=` parameter (we suggested `/tmp/mii-sample/mydatasource.yaml` earlier). Note that the `-from-file=` parameter can reference a single file, in which case it puts the designated file in the ConfigMap, or it can reference a directory, in which case it populates the ConfigMap with all of the files in the designated directory.\n+\n+   Observations:\n+     - We are leaving the namespace `sample-domain1-ns` unchanged for the ConfigMap because we plan to deploy domain `sample-domain2` to the same namespace as `sample-domain1`.\n+     - We name and label the ConfigMap using its associated domain UID for two reasons:\n+       - To make it obvious which ConfigMap belongs to which domain.\n+       - To make it easier to clean up a domain. Typical cleanup scripts use the `weblogic.domainUID` label as a convenience for finding all resources associated with a domain.\n+     - We use a different ConfigMap for the new domain for two reasons:\n+       - To make it easier to keep the life cycle and/or CI/CD process for the two domains simple and independent.\n+       - To 'future proof' the new domain so that changes to the original domain or new domain's ConfigMap can be independent.\n+\n+\n+1. Create the secrets that are referenced by the WDT model files in the image and ConfigMap; they also will be referenced by the domain resource.\n+\n+   Run the following commands:\n+   ```\n+   $ # spec.webLogicCredentialsSecret\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create secret generic \\\n+     sample-domain2-weblogic-credentials \\\n+      --from-literal=username=weblogic --from-literal=password=welcome1\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label  secret \\\n+     sample-domain2-weblogic-credentials \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain2\n+\n+   $ # spec.configuration.model.runtimeEncryptionSecret\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create secret generic \\\n+     sample-domain2-runtime-encryption-secret \\\n+      --from-literal=password=my_runtime_password\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label  secret \\\n+     sample-domain2-runtime-encryption-secret \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain2\n+\n+   $ # referenced by spec.configuration.secrets and by the datasource model YAML in the ConfigMap\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create secret generic \\\n+     sample-domain2-datasource-secret \\\n+      --from-literal=password=Oradoc_db1 \\\n+      --from-literal=url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label  secret \\\n+     sample-domain2-datasource-secret \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain2\n+   ```\n+\n+   Observations:\n+     - We are leaving the namespace `sample-domain1-ns` unchanged for each secret because we plan to deploy domain `sample-domain2` to the same namespace as `sample-domain1`.\n+     - We name and label the secrets using their associated domain UID for two reasons:\n+       - To make it obvious which secret belongs to which domain.\n+       - To make it easier to clean up a domain.

It does this by:\n+\n+- Using the same image, image model YAML, and application archive as the Initial and Update1 use cases.\n+- Using the same model update ConfigMap source file as the Update1 use case (a data source).\n+- Using a different (unique) domain UID, `sample-domain2`, for the new domain.\n+- Using a different (unique) domain name, `domain2`, for the different domains.\n+- Deploying secrets and a model update ConfigMap that are uniquely labeled and named for the new domain.\n+\n+Note that this use case shows Model in Image's unique ability to quickly deploy a copy of a WebLogic domain that has a different WebLogic domain name and domain encryption key. This is a useful capability that is not supported by the Domain in Image domain home source type:\n+\n+- A Domain in Image domain home source type does not support overriding the domain name, but different domain names are necessary when two domains need to interoperate. In this use case, we take advantage of model macros to ensure that its two different domains have a different domain name: \n+\n+  - First, we define the domain name in the model YAML using the `@@ENV:CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME@@` environment variable macro.\n+  - Second, we set the value of the `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME` environment variable differently using the `env` stanza in each domain's domain resource.\n+\n+- Domain in Image requires that its images embed a WebLogic `security/SerializedSystemIni.dat` domain encryption key that cannot be changed for the image (see [why layering matters]({{< relref \"/userguide/cicd/why-layering-matters.md\" >}}) in CI/CD Considerations). This necessarily means that two Domain in Image domains that share the same image have the ability to decrypt each other's encrypted passwords. A Model in Image's domain encryption key, on the other hand, is not embedded in the image and instead, is dynamically and uniquely created each time the domain is started. \n+\n+{{% notice warning %}}\n+Oracle requires interoperating WebLogic domains to have different domain names. This is necessary when two domains communicate, or when a WebLogic Server or WebLogic Java client concurrently connects to multiple domains. \n+{{% /notice %}}\n+\n+Here are the steps for this use case:\n+\n+1. Make sure you have deployed the domain from the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case).\n+\n+1. Create a ConfigMap with the WDT model that contains the data source definition.\n+\n+   Run the following commands:\n+\n+   ```\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create configmap sample-domain2-wdt-config-map \\\n+     --from-file=/tmp/mii-sample/model-configmaps/datasource\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label configmap sample-domain2-wdt-config-map \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain2\n+   ```\n+\n+   If you've created your own data source file in the Update1 use case, then substitute the file name in the `--from-file=` parameter (we suggested `/tmp/mii-sample/mydatasource.yaml` earlier). Note that the `-from-file=` parameter can reference a single file, in which case it puts the designated file in the ConfigMap, or it can reference a directory, in which case it populates the ConfigMap with all of the files in the designated directory.\n+\n+   Observations:\n+     - We are leaving the namespace `sample-domain1-ns` unchanged for the ConfigMap because we plan to deploy domain `sample-domain2` to the same namespace as `sample-domain1`.\n+     - We name and label the ConfigMap using its associated domain UID for two reasons:\n+       - To make it obvious which ConfigMap belongs to which domain.\n+       - To make it easier to clean up a domain. Typical cleanup scripts use the `weblogic.domainUID` label as a convenience for finding all resources associated with a domain.\n+     - We use a different ConfigMap for the new domain for two reasons:\n+       - To make it easier to keep the life cycle and/or CI/CD process for the two domains simple and independent.\n+       - To 'future proof' the new domain so that changes to the original domain or new domain's ConfigMap can be independent.\n+\n+\n+1. Create the secrets that are referenced by the WDT model files in the image and ConfigMap; they also will be referenced by the domain resource.\n+\n+   Run the following commands:\n+   ```\n+   $ # spec.webLogicCredentialsSecret\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create secret generic \\\n+     sample-domain2-weblogic-credentials \\\n+      --from-literal=username=weblogic --from-literal=password=welcome1\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label  secret \\\n+     sample-domain2-weblogic-credentials \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain2\n+\n+   $ # spec.configuration.model.runtimeEncryptionSecret\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create secret generic \\\n+     sample-domain2-runtime-encryption-secret \\\n+      --from-literal=password=my_runtime_password\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label  secret \\\n+     sample-domain2-runtime-encryption-secret \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain2\n+\n+   $ # referenced by spec.configuration.secrets and by the datasource model YAML in the ConfigMap\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create secret generic \\\n+     sample-domain2-datasource-secret \\\n+      --from-literal=password=Oradoc_db1 \\\n+      --from-literal=url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label  secret \\\n+     sample-domain2-datasource-secret \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain2\n+   ```\n+\n+   Observations:\n+     - We are leaving the namespace `sample-domain1-ns` unchanged for each secret because we plan to deploy domain `sample-domain2` to the same namespace as `sample-domain1`.\n+     - We name and label the secrets using their associated domain UID for two reasons:\n+       - To make it obvious which secret belongs to which domain.\n+       - To make it easier to clean up a domain.

It does this by:\n+\n+- Using the same image, image model YAML, and application archive as the Initial and Update1 use cases.\n+- Using the same model update ConfigMap source file as the Update1 use case (a data source).\n+- Using a different (unique) domain UID, `sample-domain2`, for the new domain.\n+- Using a different (unique) domain name, `domain2`, for the different domains.\n+- Deploying secrets and a model update ConfigMap that are uniquely labeled and named for the new domain.\n+\n+Note that this use case shows Model in Image's unique ability to quickly deploy a copy of a WebLogic domain that has a different WebLogic domain name and domain encryption key. This is a useful capability that is not supported by the Domain in Image domain home source type:\n+\n+- A Domain in Image domain home source type does not support overriding the domain name, but different domain names are necessary when two domains need to interoperate. In this use case, we take advantage of model macros to ensure that its two different domains have a different domain name: \n+\n+  - First, we define the domain name in the model YAML using the `@@ENV:CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME@@` environment variable macro.\n+  - Second, we set the value of the `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME` environment variable differently using the `env` stanza in each domain's domain resource.\n+\n+- Domain in Image requires that its images embed a WebLogic `security/SerializedSystemIni.dat` domain encryption key that cannot be changed for the image (see [why layering matters]({{< relref \"/userguide/cicd/why-layering-matters.md\" >}}) in CI/CD Considerations). This necessarily means that two Domain in Image domains that share the same image have the ability to decrypt each other's encrypted passwords. A Model in Image's domain encryption key, on the other hand, is not embedded in the image and instead, is dynamically and uniquely created each time the domain is started. \n+\n+{{% notice warning %}}\n+Oracle requires interoperating WebLogic domains to have different domain names. This is necessary when two domains communicate, or when a WebLogic Server or WebLogic Java client concurrently connects to multiple domains. \n+{{% /notice %}}\n+\n+Here are the steps for this use case:\n+\n+1. Make sure you have deployed the domain from the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case).\n+\n+1. Create a ConfigMap with the WDT model that contains the data source definition.\n+\n+   Run the following commands:\n+\n+   ```\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create configmap sample-domain2-wdt-config-map \\\n+     --from-file=/tmp/mii-sample/model-configmaps/datasource\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label configmap sample-domain2-wdt-config-map \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain2\n+   ```\n+\n+   If you've created your own data source file in the Update1 use case, then substitute the file name in the `--from-file=` parameter (we suggested `/tmp/mii-sample/mydatasource.yaml` earlier). Note that the `-from-file=` parameter can reference a single file, in which case it puts the designated file in the ConfigMap, or it can reference a directory, in which case it populates the ConfigMap with all of the files in the designated directory.\n+\n+   Observations:\n+     - We are leaving the namespace `sample-domain1-ns` unchanged for the ConfigMap because we plan to deploy domain `sample-domain2` to the same namespace as `sample-domain1`.\n+     - We name and label the ConfigMap using its associated domain UID for two reasons:\n+       - To make it obvious which ConfigMap belongs to which domain.\n+       - To make it easier to clean up a domain. Typical cleanup scripts use the `weblogic.domainUID` label as a convenience for finding all resources associated with a domain.\n+     - We use a different ConfigMap for the new domain for two reasons:\n+       - To make it easier to keep the life cycle and/or CI/CD process for the two domains simple and independent.\n+       - To 'future proof' the new domain so that changes to the original domain or new domain's ConfigMap can be independent.\n+\n+\n+1. Create the secrets that are referenced by the WDT model files in the image and ConfigMap; they also will be referenced by the domain resource.\n+\n+   Run the following commands:\n+   ```\n+   $ # spec.webLogicCredentialsSecret\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create secret generic \\\n+     sample-domain2-weblogic-credentials \\\n+      --from-literal=username=weblogic --from-literal=password=welcome1\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label  secret \\\n+     sample-domain2-weblogic-credentials \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain2\n+\n+   $ # spec.configuration.model.runtimeEncryptionSecret\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create secret generic \\\n+     sample-domain2-runtime-encryption-secret \\\n+      --from-literal=password=my_runtime_password\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label  secret \\\n+     sample-domain2-runtime-encryption-secret \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain2\n+\n+   $ # referenced by spec.configuration.secrets and by the datasource model YAML in the ConfigMap\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create secret generic \\\n+     sample-domain2-datasource-secret \\\n+      --from-literal=password=Oradoc_db1 \\\n+      --from-literal=url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label  secret \\\n+     sample-domain2-datasource-secret \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain2\n+   ```\n+\n+   Observations:\n+     - We are leaving the namespace `sample-domain1-ns` unchanged for each secret because we plan to deploy domain `sample-domain2` to the same namespace as `sample-domain1`.\n+     - We name and label the secrets using their associated domain UID for two reasons:\n+       - To make it obvious which secret belongs to which domain.\n+       - To make it easier to clean up a domain.

This is a useful capability that is not supported by the Domain in Image domain home source type:\n+\n+- A Domain in Image domain home source type does not support overriding the domain name, but different domain names are necessary when two domains need to interoperate. In this use case, we take advantage of model macros to ensure that its two different domains have a different domain name: \n+\n+  - First, we define the domain name in the model YAML using the `@@ENV:CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME@@` environment variable macro.\n+  - Second, we set the value of the `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME` environment variable differently using the `env` stanza in each domain's domain resource.\n+\n+- Domain in Image requires that its images embed a WebLogic `security/SerializedSystemIni.dat` domain encryption key that cannot be changed for the image (see [why layering matters]({{< relref \"/userguide/cicd/why-layering-matters.md\" >}}) in CI/CD Considerations). This necessarily means that two Domain in Image domains that share the same image have the ability to decrypt each other's encrypted passwords. A Model in Image's domain encryption key, on the other hand, is not embedded in the image and instead, is dynamically and uniquely created each time the domain is started. \n+\n+{{% notice warning %}}\n+Oracle requires interoperating WebLogic domains to have different domain names.

Note that the `-from-file=` parameter can reference a single file, in which case it puts the designated file in the ConfigMap, or it can reference a directory, in which case it populates the ConfigMap with all of the files in the designated directory.\n+\n+   Observations:\n+     - We are leaving the namespace `sample-domain1-ns` unchanged for the ConfigMap because we plan to deploy domain `sample-domain2` to the same namespace as `sample-domain1`.\n+     - We name and label the ConfigMap using its associated domain UID for two reasons:\n+       - To make it obvious which ConfigMap belongs to which domain.\n+       - To make it easier to clean up a domain.

Set up a domain resource that is similar to your \"Update1\" use case domain resource but with different domain UID, domain name, model update ConfigMap reference, and secret references:\n+\n+    - Option 1: Update a copy of your domain resource file from the \"Update1\" use case.\n+\n+      - You might recall that in the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case) we suggested creating a file named `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-update1.yaml` or using the `/tmp/mii-sample/domain-resources/WLS/mii-update1-d1-WLS-v1-ds.yaml` file that is supplied with the sample.\n+        - We suggest copying this domain resource file and naming the copy `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-update2.yaml` before making any changes.\n+\n+        - Working on a copy is not strictly necessary, but it helps to keep track of your work for the different use cases in this sample and also provides you a backup of your previous work.\n+\n+      - Change the `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-update2.yaml` domain resource name and `weblogic.domainUID` label to `sample-domain2`.\n+\n+        The final result should look something like this:\n+\n+          ``` \n+          apiVersion: \"weblogic.oracle/v7\"\n+          kind: Domain\n+          metadata:\n+            name: sample-domain2\n+            namespace: sample-domain1-ns\n+            labels:\n+              weblogic.resourceVersion: domain-v2\n+              weblogic.domainUID: sample-domain2\n+          ```\n+\n+        > __NOTE__: We are leaving the namespace `sample-domain1-ns` unchanged because we will be deploying domain `sample-domain2` to the same namespace as `sample-domain1`.\n \n+      - Change the `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-update2.yaml` domain resource's `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME` environment variable from `domain1` to `domain2`.\n+\n+        The model file in the image uses macro `@@ENV:CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME@@` to reference this environment variable when setting its domain name. \n+\n+        Specifically, change the corresponding domain resource `spec.serverPod.env` YAML stanza to look something like this:\n+\n+        ```\n+        ...\n+        spec:\n+          ...\n+          serverPod:\n+          ...\n+            env:\n+            - name: CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME\n+              value: \"domain2\"\n+          ...\n+        ```\n+\n+      - Change the `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-update2.yaml` domain resource `spec.domainHome` value to `/u01/domains/sample-domain2`.

It does this by:\n+\n+- Using the same image, image model YAML, and application archive as the Initial and Update1 use cases.\n+- Using the same model update ConfigMap source file as the Update1 use case (a data source).\n+- Using a different (unique) domain UID, `sample-domain2`, for the new domain.\n+- Using a different (unique) domain name, `domain2`, for the different domains.\n+- Deploying secrets and a model update ConfigMap that are uniquely labeled and named for the new domain.\n+\n+Note that this use case shows Model in Image's unique ability to quickly deploy a copy of a WebLogic domain that has a different WebLogic domain name and domain encryption key. This is a useful capability that is not supported by the Domain in Image domain home source type:\n+\n+- A Domain in Image domain home source type does not support overriding the domain name, but different domain names are necessary when two domains need to interoperate. In this use case, we take advantage of model macros to ensure that its two different domains have a different domain name: \n+\n+  - First, we define the domain name in the model YAML using the `@@ENV:CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME@@` environment variable macro.\n+  - Second, we set the value of the `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME` environment variable differently using the `env` stanza in each domain's domain resource.\n+\n+- Domain in Image requires that its images embed a WebLogic `security/SerializedSystemIni.dat` domain encryption key that cannot be changed for the image (see [why layering matters]({{< relref \"/userguide/cicd/why-layering-matters.md\" >}}) in CI/CD Considerations). This necessarily means that two Domain in Image domains that share the same image have the ability to decrypt each other's encrypted passwords. A Model in Image's domain encryption key, on the other hand, is not embedded in the image and instead, is dynamically and uniquely created each time the domain is started. \n+\n+{{% notice warning %}}\n+Oracle requires interoperating WebLogic domains to have different domain names. This is necessary when two domains communicate, or when a WebLogic Server or WebLogic Java client concurrently connects to multiple domains. \n+{{% /notice %}}\n+\n+Here are the steps for this use case:\n+\n+1. Make sure you have deployed the domain from the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case).\n+\n+1.

Note that the `-from-file=` parameter can reference a single file, in which case it puts the designated file in the ConfigMap, or it can reference a directory, in which case it populates the ConfigMap with all of the files in the designated directory.\n+\n+   Observations:\n+     - We are leaving the namespace `sample-domain1-ns` unchanged for the ConfigMap because we plan to deploy domain `sample-domain2` to the same namespace as `sample-domain1`.\n+     - We name and label the ConfigMap using its associated domain UID for two reasons:\n+       - To make it obvious which ConfigMap belongs to which domain.\n+       - To make it easier to clean up a domain. Typical cleanup scripts use the `weblogic.domainUID` label as a convenience for finding all resources associated with a domain.\n+     - We use a different ConfigMap for the new domain for two reasons:\n+       - To make it easier to keep the life cycle and/or CI/CD process for the two domains simple and independent.\n+       - To 'future proof' the new domain so that changes to the original domain or new domain's ConfigMap can be independent.\n+\n+\n+1.

We leave it there to demonstrate that the old version can remain in case you want to revert to it. After the new image is applied, you can revert by modifying your model's `configuration.model.configMap` to override the related application path in your image model.\n+\n+Here are the steps for this use case:\n+\n+1. Make sure you have deployed the domain from the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case).\n+\n+2. Create an updated image. \n+\n+   Recall that a goal of the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) was to demonstrate using the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image named `model-in-image:WLS-v1` from files that were staged in `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image:WLS-v1/`. The staged files included a web application in a WDT ZIP archive, and WDT model configuration for a WebLogic Administration Server called `admin-server` and a WebLogic cluster called `cluster-1`. The final image was called `model-in-image:WLS-v1` and, in addition to having a copy of the staged files in its `/u01/wdt/models` directory, also contained a WebLogic installation and a WebLogic Deploy Tooling installation.\n+\n+   In this use case, we will follow similar steps to the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) in order to create a new image with an updated application and model, plus deploy the updated model and application to the running [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case) domain.\n+\n+   - Understanding our updated WDT archive.\n+\n+     The updated archive for this use case is in directory `/tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v2`. We will use it to create an archive ZIP file for the image. This archive is similar to the `/tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v1` from the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) with the the following differences:\n+     - It includes an updated version of the application in `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2` (while keeping the original application in directory `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v1`).\n+     - The application in `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2/myapp_war/index.jsp` contains a single difference from the original application: it changes the line `out.println(\"Hello World! This is version 'v1' of the mii-sample JSP web-app.\");` to `out.println(\"Hello World! This is version 'v2' of the mii-sample JSP web-app.\");`.\n+\n+     For additional information about archives, see the [Understanding our first archive](#understanding-our-first-archive) section in the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) within this sample.\n+\n+   - Stage a ZIP file of the WDT archive.\n+\n+     > **Note**: If you are using JRF in this sample, substitute `JRF` for each occurrence of `WLS` in the paths below.\n+\n+     When we create our updated image, we will use the files in staging directory `/tmp/mii-sample/model-in-image__WLS-v2`. In preparation, we need it to contain a ZIP file of the new WDT application archive.\n+\n+     Run the following commands to create your application archive ZIP file and put it in the expected directory:\n+\n+     ```\n+     # Delete existing archive.zip in case we have an old leftover version\n+     $ rm -f /tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip\n+\n+     # Move to the directory which contains the source files for our new archive\n+     $ cd /tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v2\n+\n+     # Zip the archive to the location will later use when we run the WebLogic Image Tool\n+     $ zip -r /tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip wlsdeploy\n+     ```\n+\n+   - Understanding our staged model files.\n+\n+     The WDT model YAML file and properties for this use case have already been staged for you to directory `/tmp/mii-sample/model-in-image__WLS-v2`. \n+\n+     The `model.10.yaml` file in this directory has an updated path `wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2` that references the updated web application in our archive, but is otherwise identical to the model staged for the original image. The final related YAML stanza looks like this:\n+\n+     ```\n+     appDeployments:\n+         Application:\n+             myapp:\n+                 SourcePath: 'wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2'\n+                 ModuleType: ear\n+                 Target: 'cluster-1'\n+     ```\n+\n+     If you would like to review the entire original model before this change, see [Staging model files](#staging-model-files) in the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) within this sample.\n+\n+   - Create a new image from our staged model files using WIT.\n+\n+     > **Note**: If you are using JRF in this sample, substitute `JRF` for each occurrence of `WLS` in the `imagetool` command line below, plus substitute `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4` for the `--fromImage` value.\n+\n+     At this point, we have staged all of the files needed for image `model-in-image:WLS-v2`, they include:\n+\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/weblogic-deploy.zip`\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.yaml`\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.properties`\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip`\n+\n+     If you don't see the `weblogic-deploy.zip` file, then it means that you missed a step in the prerequisites.\n+\n+     Now let's use the Image Tool to create an image named `model-in-image:WLS-v2` that's layered on a base WebLogic image. We've already set up this tool during the prerequisite steps at the beginning of this sample.\n+\n+     Run the following commands to create the model image and verify that it worked:\n+\n+     ```\n+     $ cd /tmp/mii-sample/model-images\n+     $ ./imagetool/bin/imagetool.sh update \\\n+       --tag model-in-image:WLS-v2 \\\n+       --fromImage container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4 \\\n+       --wdtModel      ./model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.yaml \\\n+       --wdtVariables  ./model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.properties \\\n+       --wdtArchive    ./model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip \\\n+       --wdtModelOnly \\\n+       --wdtDomainType WLS\n+     ```\n+\n+     If you don't see the `imagetool` directory, then it means that you missed a step in the prerequisites.\n+\n+     This command runs the WebLogic Image Tool in its Model in Image mode, and does the following:\n+     - Builds the final Docker image as a layer on the `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4` base image.\n+     - Copies the WDT ZIP file that's referenced in the WIT cache into the image.\n+       - Note that we cached WDT in WIT using the keyword `latest` when we set up the cache during the sample prerequisites steps.\n+       - This lets WIT implicitly assume it's the desired WDT version and removes the need to pass a `-wdtVersion` flag.\n+     - Copies the specified WDT model, properties, and application archives to image location `/u01/wdt/models`.\n+\n+     When the command succeeds, it should end with output like:\n+\n+     ```\n+     [INFO   ] Build successful. Build time=36s. Image tag=model-in-image:WLS-v2\n+     ```\n+\n+     Also, if you run the `docker images` command, then you should see a Docker image named `model-in-image:WLS-v2`.\n+\n+1. Set up and apply a domain resource that is similar to your \"Update1\" use case domain resource but with a different image:\n+\n+   > **Note**: If you are using JRF in this sample, substitute `JRF` for each occurrence of `WLS` in the paths, files, and image names below.\n+\n+   - Option 1: Update a copy of your domain resource file from the \"Update1\" use case.\n+\n+     - You might recall that in the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case) we suggested creating a file named `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-update1.yaml` or using the `/tmp/mii-sample/domain-resources/WLS/mii-update1-d1-WLS-v1-ds.yaml` file that is supplied with the sample.\n+\n+       - We suggest copying this domain resource file and naming the copy `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-update3.yaml` before making any changes.\n+\n+       - Working on a copy is not strictly necessary, but it helps to keep track of your work for the different use cases in this sample and also provides you a backup of your previous work.\n+\n+     - Change the `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-update3.yaml` domain resource `image` field to reference `model-in-image:WLS-v2` instead of `model-in-image:WLS-v1`.\n+\n+        The final result should look something like this:\n+\n+        ```\n+        ...\n+        spec:\n+          ...\n+          image: \"model-in-image:WLS-v2\"\n+        ```\n+\n+      - Apply your changed domain resource:\n+\n+          ```\n+          $ kubectl apply -f /tmp/mii-sample/mii-update3.yaml\n+          ```\n+\n+    - Option 2: Use the updated domain resource file that is supplied with the sample:\n+\n+        ```\n+        $ kubectl apply -f /tmp/miisample/domain-resources/WLS/mii-update3-d1-WLS-v2-ds.yaml\n+        ```\n+\n+\n+1. Wait for the roll to complete.\n+\n+   Now that you've applied a domain resource with an updated image, the operator should automatically rerun the domain's introspector job in order to generate a new domain home, and then should restart ('roll') each of the domain's pods so that they use the new domain home and the new image. You'll need to wait for this roll to complete before we can verify that the new image and its associated new application have been deployed.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "d7f7757e84b0a55ff0182f0c04db0066e48959b6"}, "originalPosition": 794}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyNjY4MzI0OQ==", "bodyText": "done", "url": "https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/pull/1649#discussion_r426683249", "createdAt": "2020-05-18T14:50:16Z", "author": {"login": "tbarnes-us"}, "path": "docs-source/content/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -1717,8 +1749,890 @@ Here are the steps:\n \n If you see an error, then consult [Debugging]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/debugging.md\" >}}) in the Model in Image user guide.\n \n-This completes the sample scenarios.\n+If you plan to run the [Update3 use case](#update3-use-case), then leave your domain running.\n+\n+### Update2 use case\n+\n+This use case demonstrates concurrently deploying a domain that is similar to the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case) domain to the same `sample-domain1-ns` namespace but with a different domain UID, a different WebLogic domain name, and a different WebLogic domain encryption key.

This is a useful capability that is not supported by the Domain in Image domain home source type:\n+\n+- A Domain in Image domain home source type does not support overriding the domain name, but different domain names are necessary when two domains need to interoperate. In this use case, we take advantage of model macros to ensure that its two different domains have a different domain name: \n+\n+  - First, we define the domain name in the model YAML using the `@@ENV:CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME@@` environment variable macro.\n+  - Second, we set the value of the `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME` environment variable differently using the `env` stanza in each domain's domain resource.\n+\n+- Domain in Image requires that its images embed a WebLogic `security/SerializedSystemIni.dat` domain encryption key that cannot be changed for the image (see [why layering matters]({{< relref \"/userguide/cicd/why-layering-matters.md\" >}}) in CI/CD Considerations). This necessarily means that two Domain in Image domains that share the same image have the ability to decrypt each other's encrypted passwords.

We leave it there to demonstrate that the old version can remain in case you want to revert to it. After the new image is applied, you can revert by modifying your model's `configuration.model.configMap` to override the related application path in your image model.\n+\n+Here are the steps for this use case:\n+\n+1. Make sure you have deployed the domain from the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case).\n+\n+2. Create an updated image. \n+\n+   Recall that a goal of the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) was to demonstrate using the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image named `model-in-image:WLS-v1` from files that were staged in `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image:WLS-v1/`. The staged files included a web application in a WDT ZIP archive, and WDT model configuration for a WebLogic Administration Server called `admin-server` and a WebLogic cluster called `cluster-1`. The final image was called `model-in-image:WLS-v1` and, in addition to having a copy of the staged files in its `/u01/wdt/models` directory, also contained a WebLogic installation and a WebLogic Deploy Tooling installation.\n+\n+   In this use case, we will follow similar steps to the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) in order to create a new image with an updated application and model, plus deploy the updated model and application to the running [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case) domain.\n+\n+   - Understanding our updated WDT archive.\n+\n+     The updated archive for this use case is in directory `/tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v2`. We will use it to create an archive ZIP file for the image. This archive is similar to the `/tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v1` from the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) with the the following differences:\n+     - It includes an updated version of the application in `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2` (while keeping the original application in directory `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v1`).\n+     - The application in `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2/myapp_war/index.jsp` contains a single difference from the original application: it changes the line `out.println(\"Hello World! This is version 'v1' of the mii-sample JSP web-app.\");` to `out.println(\"Hello World! This is version 'v2' of the mii-sample JSP web-app.\");`.\n+\n+     For additional information about archives, see the [Understanding our first archive](#understanding-our-first-archive) section in the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) within this sample.\n+\n+   - Stage a ZIP file of the WDT archive.\n+\n+     > **Note**: If you are using JRF in this sample, substitute `JRF` for each occurrence of `WLS` in the paths below.\n+\n+     When we create our updated image, we will use the files in staging directory `/tmp/mii-sample/model-in-image__WLS-v2`. In preparation, we need it to contain a ZIP file of the new WDT application archive.\n+\n+     Run the following commands to create your application archive ZIP file and put it in the expected directory:\n+\n+     ```\n+     # Delete existing archive.zip in case we have an old leftover version\n+     $ rm -f /tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip\n+\n+     # Move to the directory which contains the source files for our new archive\n+     $ cd /tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v2\n+\n+     # Zip the archive to the location will later use when we run the WebLogic Image Tool\n+     $ zip -r /tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip wlsdeploy\n+     ```\n+\n+   - Understanding our staged model files.\n+\n+     The WDT model YAML file and properties for this use case have already been staged for you to directory `/tmp/mii-sample/model-in-image__WLS-v2`. \n+\n+     The `model.10.yaml` file in this directory has an updated path `wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2` that references the updated web application in our archive, but is otherwise identical to the model staged for the original image. The final related YAML stanza looks like this:\n+\n+     ```\n+     appDeployments:\n+         Application:\n+             myapp:\n+                 SourcePath: 'wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2'\n+                 ModuleType: ear\n+                 Target: 'cluster-1'\n+     ```\n+\n+     If you would like to review the entire original model before this change, see [Staging model files](#staging-model-files) in the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) within this sample.\n+\n+   - Create a new image from our staged model files using WIT.\n+\n+     > **Note**: If you are using JRF in this sample, substitute `JRF` for each occurrence of `WLS` in the `imagetool` command line below, plus substitute `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4` for the `--fromImage` value.\n+\n+     At this point, we have staged all of the files needed for image `model-in-image:WLS-v2`, they include:\n+\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/weblogic-deploy.zip`\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.yaml`\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.properties`\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip`\n+\n+     If you don't see the `weblogic-deploy.zip` file, then it means that you missed a step in the prerequisites.\n+\n+     Now let's use the Image Tool to create an image named `model-in-image:WLS-v2` that's layered on a base WebLogic image. We've already set up this tool during the prerequisite steps at the beginning of this sample.\n+\n+     Run the following commands to create the model image and verify that it worked:\n+\n+     ```\n+     $ cd /tmp/mii-sample/model-images\n+     $ ./imagetool/bin/imagetool.sh update \\\n+       --tag model-in-image:WLS-v2 \\\n+       --fromImage container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4 \\\n+       --wdtModel      ./model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.yaml \\\n+       --wdtVariables  ./model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.properties \\\n+       --wdtArchive    ./model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip \\\n+       --wdtModelOnly \\\n+       --wdtDomainType WLS\n+     ```\n+\n+     If you don't see the `imagetool` directory, then it means that you missed a step in the prerequisites.\n+\n+     This command runs the WebLogic Image Tool in its Model in Image mode, and does the following:\n+     - Builds the final Docker image as a layer on the `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4` base image.\n+     - Copies the WDT ZIP file that's referenced in the WIT cache into the image.\n+       - Note that we cached WDT in WIT using the keyword `latest` when we set up the cache during the sample prerequisites steps.\n+       - This lets WIT implicitly assume it's the desired WDT version and removes the need to pass a `-wdtVersion` flag.\n+     - Copies the specified WDT model, properties, and application archives to image location `/u01/wdt/models`.\n+\n+     When the command succeeds, it should end with output like:\n+\n+     ```\n+     [INFO   ] Build successful. Build time=36s. Image tag=model-in-image:WLS-v2\n+     ```\n+\n+     Also, if you run the `docker images` command, then you should see a Docker image named `model-in-image:WLS-v2`.\n+\n+1. Set up and apply a domain resource that is similar to your \"Update1\" use case domain resource but with a different image:\n+\n+   > **Note**: If you are using JRF in this sample, substitute `JRF` for each occurrence of `WLS` in the paths, files, and image names below.\n+\n+   - Option 1: Update a copy of your domain resource file from the \"Update1\" use case.\n+\n+     - You might recall that in the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case) we suggested creating a file named `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-update1.yaml` or using the `/tmp/mii-sample/domain-resources/WLS/mii-update1-d1-WLS-v1-ds.yaml` file that is supplied with the sample.\n+\n+       - We suggest copying this domain resource file and naming the copy `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-update3.yaml` before making any changes.\n+\n+       - Working on a copy is not strictly necessary, but it helps to keep track of your work for the different use cases in this sample and also provides you a backup of your previous work.\n+\n+     - Change the `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-update3.yaml` domain resource `image` field to reference `model-in-image:WLS-v2` instead of `model-in-image:WLS-v1`.\n+\n+        The final result should look something like this:\n+\n+        ```\n+        ...\n+        spec:\n+          ...\n+          image: \"model-in-image:WLS-v2\"\n+        ```\n+\n+      - Apply your changed domain resource:\n+\n+          ```\n+          $ kubectl apply -f /tmp/mii-sample/mii-update3.yaml\n+          ```\n+\n+    - Option 2: Use the updated domain resource file that is supplied with the sample:\n+\n+        ```\n+        $ kubectl apply -f /tmp/miisample/domain-resources/WLS/mii-update3-d1-WLS-v2-ds.yaml\n+        ```\n+\n+\n+1. Wait for the roll to complete.\n+\n+   Now that you've applied a domain resource with an updated image, the operator should automatically rerun the domain's introspector job in order to generate a new domain home, and then should restart ('roll') each of the domain's pods so that they use the new domain home and the new image. You'll need to wait for this roll to complete before we can verify that the new image and its associated new application have been deployed.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyNjIxMTAwNQ=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "d7f7757e84b0a55ff0182f0c04db0066e48959b6"}, "originalPosition": 794}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMjY1NDI2ODUwOnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "docs-source/content/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md", "isResolved": false, "comments": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNS0xN1QwMjo1MTozNlrOGWd2ww==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNS0xOFQxNDo1MDoyNFrOGW6rzA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyNjIxMTAxMQ==", "bodyText": "space", "url": "https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/pull/1649#discussion_r426211011", "createdAt": "2020-05-17T02:51:36Z", "author": {"login": "markxnelson"}, "path": "docs-source/content/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -1717,8 +1749,890 @@ Here are the steps:\n \n If you see an error, then consult [Debugging]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/debugging.md\" >}}) in the Model in Image user guide.\n \n-This completes the sample scenarios.\n+If you plan to run the [Update3 use case](#update3-use-case), then leave your domain running.\n+\n+### Update2 use case\n+\n+This use case demonstrates concurrently deploying a domain that is similar to the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case) domain to the same `sample-domain1-ns` namespace but with a different domain UID, a different WebLogic domain name, and a different WebLogic domain encryption key. It does this by:\n+\n+- Using the same image, image model YAML, and application archive as the Initial and Update1 use cases.\n+- Using the same model update ConfigMap source file as the Update1 use case (a data source).\n+- Using a different (unique) domain UID, `sample-domain2`, for the new domain.\n+- Using a different (unique) domain name, `domain2`, for the different domains.\n+- Deploying secrets and a model update ConfigMap that are uniquely labeled and named for the new domain.\n+\n+Note that this use case shows Model in Image's unique ability to quickly deploy a copy of a WebLogic domain that has a different WebLogic domain name and domain encryption key. This is a useful capability that is not supported by the Domain in Image domain home source type:\n+\n+- A Domain in Image domain home source type does not support overriding the domain name, but different domain names are necessary when two domains need to interoperate. In this use case, we take advantage of model macros to ensure that its two different domains have a different domain name: \n+\n+  - First, we define the domain name in the model YAML using the `@@ENV:CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME@@` environment variable macro.\n+  - Second, we set the value of the `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME` environment variable differently using the `env` stanza in each domain's domain resource.\n+\n+- Domain in Image requires that its images embed a WebLogic `security/SerializedSystemIni.dat` domain encryption key that cannot be changed for the image (see [why layering matters]({{< relref \"/userguide/cicd/why-layering-matters.md\" >}}) in CI/CD Considerations). This necessarily means that two Domain in Image domains that share the same image have the ability to decrypt each other's encrypted passwords.

We leave it there to demonstrate that the old version can remain in case you want to revert to it. After the new image is applied, you can revert by modifying your model's `configuration.model.configMap` to override the related application path in your image model.\n+\n+Here are the steps for this use case:\n+\n+1. Make sure you have deployed the domain from the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case).\n+\n+2. Create an updated image. \n+\n+   Recall that a goal of the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) was to demonstrate using the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image named `model-in-image:WLS-v1` from files that were staged in `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image:WLS-v1/`. The staged files included a web application in a WDT ZIP archive, and WDT model configuration for a WebLogic Administration Server called `admin-server` and a WebLogic cluster called `cluster-1`. The final image was called `model-in-image:WLS-v1` and, in addition to having a copy of the staged files in its `/u01/wdt/models` directory, also contained a WebLogic installation and a WebLogic Deploy Tooling installation.\n+\n+   In this use case, we will follow similar steps to the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) in order to create a new image with an updated application and model, plus deploy the updated model and application to the running [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case) domain.\n+\n+   - Understanding our updated WDT archive.\n+\n+     The updated archive for this use case is in directory `/tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v2`. We will use it to create an archive ZIP file for the image. This archive is similar to the `/tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v1` from the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) with the the following differences:\n+     - It includes an updated version of the application in `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2` (while keeping the original application in directory `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v1`).\n+     - The application in `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2/myapp_war/index.jsp` contains a single difference from the original application: it changes the line `out.println(\"Hello World! This is version 'v1' of the mii-sample JSP web-app.\");` to `out.println(\"Hello World! This is version 'v2' of the mii-sample JSP web-app.\");`.\n+\n+     For additional information about archives, see the [Understanding our first archive](#understanding-our-first-archive) section in the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) within this sample.\n+\n+   - Stage a ZIP file of the WDT archive.\n+\n+     > **Note**: If you are using JRF in this sample, substitute `JRF` for each occurrence of `WLS` in the paths below.\n+\n+     When we create our updated image, we will use the files in staging directory `/tmp/mii-sample/model-in-image__WLS-v2`. In preparation, we need it to contain a ZIP file of the new WDT application archive.\n+\n+     Run the following commands to create your application archive ZIP file and put it in the expected directory:\n+\n+     ```\n+     # Delete existing archive.zip in case we have an old leftover version\n+     $ rm -f /tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip\n+\n+     # Move to the directory which contains the source files for our new archive\n+     $ cd /tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v2\n+\n+     # Zip the archive to the location will later use when we run the WebLogic Image Tool\n+     $ zip -r /tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip wlsdeploy\n+     ```\n+\n+   - Understanding our staged model files.\n+\n+     The WDT model YAML file and properties for this use case have already been staged for you to directory `/tmp/mii-sample/model-in-image__WLS-v2`. \n+\n+     The `model.10.yaml` file in this directory has an updated path `wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2` that references the updated web application in our archive, but is otherwise identical to the model staged for the original image. The final related YAML stanza looks like this:\n+\n+     ```\n+     appDeployments:\n+         Application:\n+             myapp:\n+                 SourcePath: 'wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2'\n+                 ModuleType: ear\n+                 Target: 'cluster-1'\n+     ```\n+\n+     If you would like to review the entire original model before this change, see [Staging model files](#staging-model-files) in the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) within this sample.\n+\n+   - Create a new image from our staged model files using WIT.\n+\n+     > **Note**: If you are using JRF in this sample, substitute `JRF` for each occurrence of `WLS` in the `imagetool` command line below, plus substitute `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4` for the `--fromImage` value.\n+\n+     At this point, we have staged all of the files needed for image `model-in-image:WLS-v2`, they include:\n+\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/weblogic-deploy.zip`\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.yaml`\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.properties`\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip`\n+\n+     If you don't see the `weblogic-deploy.zip` file, then it means that you missed a step in the prerequisites.\n+\n+     Now let's use the Image Tool to create an image named `model-in-image:WLS-v2` that's layered on a base WebLogic image. We've already set up this tool during the prerequisite steps at the beginning of this sample.\n+\n+     Run the following commands to create the model image and verify that it worked:\n+\n+     ```\n+     $ cd /tmp/mii-sample/model-images\n+     $ ./imagetool/bin/imagetool.sh update \\\n+       --tag model-in-image:WLS-v2 \\\n+       --fromImage container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4 \\\n+       --wdtModel      ./model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.yaml \\\n+       --wdtVariables  ./model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.properties \\\n+       --wdtArchive    ./model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip \\\n+       --wdtModelOnly \\\n+       --wdtDomainType WLS\n+     ```\n+\n+     If you don't see the `imagetool` directory, then it means that you missed a step in the prerequisites.\n+\n+     This command runs the WebLogic Image Tool in its Model in Image mode, and does the following:\n+     - Builds the final Docker image as a layer on the `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4` base image.\n+     - Copies the WDT ZIP file that's referenced in the WIT cache into the image.\n+       - Note that we cached WDT in WIT using the keyword `latest` when we set up the cache during the sample prerequisites steps.\n+       - This lets WIT implicitly assume it's the desired WDT version and removes the need to pass a `-wdtVersion` flag.\n+     - Copies the specified WDT model, properties, and application archives to image location `/u01/wdt/models`.\n+\n+     When the command succeeds, it should end with output like:\n+\n+     ```\n+     [INFO   ] Build successful. Build time=36s. Image tag=model-in-image:WLS-v2\n+     ```\n+\n+     Also, if you run the `docker images` command, then you should see a Docker image named `model-in-image:WLS-v2`.\n+\n+1. Set up and apply a domain resource that is similar to your \"Update1\" use case domain resource but with a different image:\n+\n+   > **Note**: If you are using JRF in this sample, substitute `JRF` for each occurrence of `WLS` in the paths, files, and image names below.\n+\n+   - Option 1: Update a copy of your domain resource file from the \"Update1\" use case.\n+\n+     - You might recall that in the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case) we suggested creating a file named `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-update1.yaml` or using the `/tmp/mii-sample/domain-resources/WLS/mii-update1-d1-WLS-v1-ds.yaml` file that is supplied with the sample.\n+\n+       - We suggest copying this domain resource file and naming the copy `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-update3.yaml` before making any changes.\n+\n+       - Working on a copy is not strictly necessary, but it helps to keep track of your work for the different use cases in this sample and also provides you a backup of your previous work.\n+\n+     - Change the `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-update3.yaml` domain resource `image` field to reference `model-in-image:WLS-v2` instead of `model-in-image:WLS-v1`.\n+\n+        The final result should look something like this:\n+\n+        ```\n+        ...\n+        spec:\n+          ...\n+          image: \"model-in-image:WLS-v2\"\n+        ```\n+\n+      - Apply your changed domain resource:\n+\n+          ```\n+          $ kubectl apply -f /tmp/mii-sample/mii-update3.yaml\n+          ```\n+\n+    - Option 2: Use the updated domain resource file that is supplied with the sample:\n+\n+        ```\n+        $ kubectl apply -f /tmp/miisample/domain-resources/WLS/mii-update3-d1-WLS-v2-ds.yaml\n+        ```\n+\n+\n+1. Wait for the roll to complete.\n+\n+   Now that you've applied a domain resource with an updated image, the operator should automatically rerun the domain's introspector job in order to generate a new domain home, and then should restart ('roll') each of the domain's pods so that they use the new domain home and the new image. You'll need to wait for this roll to complete before we can verify that the new image and its associated new application have been deployed.\n+\n+   - One way to do this is to call `kubectl get pods -n sample-domain1-ns --watch` and wait for the pods to cycle back to their `ready` state.\n+\n+   - Alternatively, you can run `/tmp/mii-sample/utils/wl-pod-wait.sh -p 3`. This is a utility script that provides useful information about a domain's pods and waits for them to reach a `ready` state, reach their target `restartVersion`, and reach their target `image` before exiting.\n+\n+     {{%expand \"Click here to expand the `wl-pod-wait.sh` usage.\" %}}\n+   ```\n+     $ ./wl-pod-wait.sh -?\n+\n+       Usage:\n+\n+         wl-pod-wait.sh [-n mynamespace] [-d mydomainuid] \\\n+            [-p expected_pod_count] \\\n+            [-t timeout_secs] \\\n+            [-q]\n+\n+         Exits non-zero if 'timeout_secs' is reached before 'pod_count' is reached.\n+\n+       Parameters:\n+\n+         -d <domain_uid> : Defaults to 'sample-domain1'.\n+\n+         -n <namespace>  : Defaults to 'sample-domain1-ns'.\n+\n+         pod_count > 0   : Wait until exactly 'pod_count' WebLogic server pods for\n+                           a domain all (a) are ready, (b) have the same\n+                           'domainRestartVersion' label value as the\n+                           current domain resource's 'spec.restartVersion, and\n+                           (c) have the same image as the current domain\n+                           resource's image.\n+\n+         pod_count = 0   : Wait until there are no running WebLogic server pods\n+                           for a domain.

scenarios.\n+If you plan to run the [Update3 use case](#update3-use-case), then leave your domain running.\n+\n+### Update2 use case\n+\n+This use case demonstrates concurrently deploying a domain that is similar to the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case) domain to the same `sample-domain1-ns` namespace but with a different domain UID, a different WebLogic domain name, and a different WebLogic domain encryption key. It does this by:\n+\n+- Using the same image, image model YAML, and application archive as the Initial and Update1 use cases.\n+- Using the same model update ConfigMap source file as the Update1 use case (a data source).\n+- Using a different (unique) domain UID, `sample-domain2`, for the new domain.\n+- Using a different (unique) domain name, `domain2`, for the different domains.\n+- Deploying secrets and a model update ConfigMap that are uniquely labeled and named for the new domain.\n+\n+Note that this use case shows Model in Image's unique ability to quickly deploy a copy of a WebLogic domain that has a different WebLogic domain name and domain encryption key. This is a useful capability that is not supported by the Domain in Image domain home source type:\n+\n+- A Domain in Image domain home source type does not support overriding the domain name, but different domain names are necessary when two domains need to interoperate. In this use case, we take advantage of model macros to ensure that its two different domains have a different domain name: \n+\n+  - First, we define the domain name in the model YAML using the `@@ENV:CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME@@` environment variable macro.\n+  - Second, we set the value of the `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME` environment variable differently using the `env` stanza in each domain's domain resource.\n+\n+- Domain in Image requires that its images embed a WebLogic `security/SerializedSystemIni.dat` domain encryption key that cannot be changed for the image (see [why layering matters]({{< relref \"/userguide/cicd/why-layering-matters.md\" >}}) in CI/CD Considerations). This necessarily means that two Domain in Image domains that share the same image have the ability to decrypt each other's encrypted passwords. A Model in Image's domain encryption key, on the other hand, is not embedded in the image and instead, is dynamically and uniquely created each time the domain is started. \n+\n+{{% notice warning %}}\n+Oracle requires interoperating WebLogic domains to have different domain names. This is necessary when two domains communicate, or when a WebLogic Server or WebLogic Java client concurrently connects to multiple domains. \n+{{% /notice %}}\n+\n+Here are the steps for this use case:\n+\n+1. Make sure you have deployed the domain from the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case).\n+\n+1.

Note that the `-from-file=` parameter can reference a single file, in which case it puts the designated file in the ConfigMap, or it can reference a directory, in which case it populates the ConfigMap with all of the files in the designated directory.\n+\n+   Observations:\n+     - We are leaving the namespace `sample-domain1-ns` unchanged for the ConfigMap because we plan to deploy domain `sample-domain2` to the same namespace as `sample-domain1`.\n+     - We name and label the ConfigMap using its associated domain UID for two reasons:\n+       - To make it obvious which ConfigMap belongs to which domain.\n+       - To make it easier to clean up a domain. Typical cleanup scripts use the `weblogic.domainUID` label as a convenience for finding all resources associated with a domain.\n+     - We use a different ConfigMap for the new domain for two reasons:\n+       - To make it easier to keep the life cycle and/or CI/CD process for the two domains simple and independent.\n+       - To 'future proof' the new domain so that changes to the original domain or new domain's ConfigMap can be independent.\n+\n+\n+1.

We leave it there to demonstrate that the old version can remain in case you want to revert to it. After the new image is applied, you can revert by modifying your model's `configuration.model.configMap` to override the related application path in your image model.\n+\n+Here are the steps for this use case:\n+\n+1. Make sure you have deployed the domain from the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case).\n+\n+2. Create an updated image. \n+\n+   Recall that a goal of the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) was to demonstrate using the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image named `model-in-image:WLS-v1` from files that were staged in `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image:WLS-v1/`. The staged files included a web application in a WDT ZIP archive, and WDT model configuration for a WebLogic Administration Server called `admin-server` and a WebLogic cluster called `cluster-1`. The final image was called `model-in-image:WLS-v1` and, in addition to having a copy of the staged files in its `/u01/wdt/models` directory, also contained a WebLogic installation and a WebLogic Deploy Tooling installation.\n+\n+   In this use case, we will follow similar steps to the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) in order to create a new image with an updated application and model, plus deploy the updated model and application to the running [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case) domain.\n+\n+   - Understanding our updated WDT archive.\n+\n+     The updated archive for this use case is in directory `/tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v2`. We will use it to create an archive ZIP file for the image. This archive is similar to the `/tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v1` from the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) with the the following differences:\n+     - It includes an updated version of the application in `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2` (while keeping the original application in directory `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v1`).\n+     - The application in `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2/myapp_war/index.jsp` contains a single difference from the original application: it changes the line `out.println(\"Hello World! This is version 'v1' of the mii-sample JSP web-app.\");` to `out.println(\"Hello World! This is version 'v2' of the mii-sample JSP web-app.\");`.\n+\n+     For additional information about archives, see the [Understanding our first archive](#understanding-our-first-archive) section in the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) within this sample.\n+\n+   - Stage a ZIP file of the WDT archive.\n+\n+     > **Note**: If you are using JRF in this sample, substitute `JRF` for each occurrence of `WLS` in the paths below.\n+\n+     When we create our updated image, we will use the files in staging directory `/tmp/mii-sample/model-in-image__WLS-v2`. In preparation, we need it to contain a ZIP file of the new WDT application archive.\n+\n+     Run the following commands to create your application archive ZIP file and put it in the expected directory:\n+\n+     ```\n+     # Delete existing archive.zip in case we have an old leftover version\n+     $ rm -f /tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip\n+\n+     # Move to the directory which contains the source files for our new archive\n+     $ cd /tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v2\n+\n+     # Zip the archive to the location will later use when we run the WebLogic Image Tool\n+     $ zip -r /tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip wlsdeploy\n+     ```\n+\n+   - Understanding our staged model files.\n+\n+     The WDT model YAML file and properties for this use case have already been staged for you to directory `/tmp/mii-sample/model-in-image__WLS-v2`. \n+\n+     The `model.10.yaml` file in this directory has an updated path `wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2` that references the updated web application in our archive, but is otherwise identical to the model staged for the original image. The final related YAML stanza looks like this:\n+\n+     ```\n+     appDeployments:\n+         Application:\n+             myapp:\n+                 SourcePath: 'wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2'\n+                 ModuleType: ear\n+                 Target: 'cluster-1'\n+     ```\n+\n+     If you would like to review the entire original model before this change, see [Staging model files](#staging-model-files) in the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) within this sample.\n+\n+   - Create a new image from our staged model files using WIT.\n+\n+     > **Note**: If you are using JRF in this sample, substitute `JRF` for each occurrence of `WLS` in the `imagetool` command line below, plus substitute `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4` for the `--fromImage` value.\n+\n+     At this point, we have staged all of the files needed for image `model-in-image:WLS-v2`, they include:\n+\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/weblogic-deploy.zip`\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.yaml`\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.properties`\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip`\n+\n+     If you don't see the `weblogic-deploy.zip` file, then it means that you missed a step in the prerequisites.\n+\n+     Now let's use the Image Tool to create an image named `model-in-image:WLS-v2` that's layered on a base WebLogic image. We've already set up this tool during the prerequisite steps at the beginning of this sample.\n+\n+     Run the following commands to create the model image and verify that it worked:\n+\n+     ```\n+     $ cd /tmp/mii-sample/model-images\n+     $ ./imagetool/bin/imagetool.sh update \\\n+       --tag model-in-image:WLS-v2 \\\n+       --fromImage container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4 \\\n+       --wdtModel      ./model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.yaml \\\n+       --wdtVariables  ./model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.properties \\\n+       --wdtArchive    ./model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip \\\n+       --wdtModelOnly \\\n+       --wdtDomainType WLS\n+     ```\n+\n+     If you don't see the `imagetool` directory, then it means that you missed a step in the prerequisites.\n+\n+     This command runs the WebLogic Image Tool in its Model in Image mode, and does the following:\n+     - Builds the final Docker image as a layer on the `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4` base image.\n+     - Copies the WDT ZIP file that's referenced in the WIT cache into the image.\n+       - Note that we cached WDT in WIT using the keyword `latest` when we set up the cache during the sample prerequisites steps.\n+       - This lets WIT implicitly assume it's the desired WDT version and removes the need to pass a `-wdtVersion` flag.\n+     - Copies the specified WDT model, properties, and application archives to image location `/u01/wdt/models`.\n+\n+     When the command succeeds, it should end with output like:\n+\n+     ```\n+     [INFO   ] Build successful. Build time=36s. Image tag=model-in-image:WLS-v2\n+     ```\n+\n+     Also, if you run the `docker images` command, then you should see a Docker image named `model-in-image:WLS-v2`.\n+\n+1. Set up and apply a domain resource that is similar to your \"Update1\" use case domain resource but with a different image:\n+\n+   > **Note**: If you are using JRF in this sample, substitute `JRF` for each occurrence of `WLS` in the paths, files, and image names below.\n+\n+   - Option 1: Update a copy of your domain resource file from the \"Update1\" use case.\n+\n+     - You might recall that in the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case) we suggested creating a file named `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-update1.yaml` or using the `/tmp/mii-sample/domain-resources/WLS/mii-update1-d1-WLS-v1-ds.yaml` file that is supplied with the sample.\n+\n+       - We suggest copying this domain resource file and naming the copy `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-update3.yaml` before making any changes.\n+\n+       - Working on a copy is not strictly necessary, but it helps to keep track of your work for the different use cases in this sample and also provides you a backup of your previous work.\n+\n+     - Change the `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-update3.yaml` domain resource `image` field to reference `model-in-image:WLS-v2` instead of `model-in-image:WLS-v1`.\n+\n+        The final result should look something like this:\n+\n+        ```\n+        ...\n+        spec:\n+          ...\n+          image: \"model-in-image:WLS-v2\"\n+        ```\n+\n+      - Apply your changed domain resource:\n+\n+          ```\n+          $ kubectl apply -f /tmp/mii-sample/mii-update3.yaml\n+          ```\n+\n+    - Option 2: Use the updated domain resource file that is supplied with the sample:\n+\n+        ```\n+        $ kubectl apply -f /tmp/miisample/domain-resources/WLS/mii-update3-d1-WLS-v2-ds.yaml\n+        ```\n+\n+\n+1. Wait for the roll to complete.\n+\n+   Now that you've applied a domain resource with an updated image, the operator should automatically rerun the domain's introspector job in order to generate a new domain home, and then should restart ('roll') each of the domain's pods so that they use the new domain home and the new image. You'll need to wait for this roll to complete before we can verify that the new image and its associated new application have been deployed.\n+\n+   - One way to do this is to call `kubectl get pods -n sample-domain1-ns --watch` and wait for the pods to cycle back to their `ready` state.\n+\n+   - Alternatively, you can run `/tmp/mii-sample/utils/wl-pod-wait.sh -p 3`. This is a utility script that provides useful information about a domain's pods and waits for them to reach a `ready` state, reach their target `restartVersion`, and reach their target `image` before exiting.\n+\n+     {{%expand \"Click here to expand the `wl-pod-wait.sh` usage.\" %}}\n+   ```\n+     $ ./wl-pod-wait.sh -?\n+\n+       Usage:\n+\n+         wl-pod-wait.sh [-n mynamespace] [-d mydomainuid] \\\n+            [-p expected_pod_count] \\\n+            [-t timeout_secs] \\\n+            [-q]\n+\n+         Exits non-zero if 'timeout_secs' is reached before 'pod_count' is reached.\n+\n+       Parameters:\n+\n+         -d <domain_uid> : Defaults to 'sample-domain1'.\n+\n+         -n <namespace>  : Defaults to 'sample-domain1-ns'.\n+\n+         pod_count > 0   : Wait until exactly 'pod_count' WebLogic server pods for\n+                           a domain all (a) are ready, (b) have the same\n+                           'domainRestartVersion' label value as the\n+                           current domain resource's 'spec.restartVersion, and\n+                           (c) have the same image as the current domain\n+                           resource's image.\n+\n+         pod_count = 0   : Wait until there are no running WebLogic server pods\n+                           for a domain.

case](#update3-use-case), then leave your domain running.\n+\n+### Update2 use case\n+\n+This use case demonstrates concurrently deploying a domain that is similar to the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case) domain to the same `sample-domain1-ns` namespace but with a different domain UID, a different WebLogic domain name, and a different WebLogic domain encryption key. It does this by:\n+\n+- Using the same image, image model YAML, and application archive as the Initial and Update1 use cases.\n+- Using the same model update ConfigMap source file as the Update1 use case (a data source).\n+- Using a different (unique) domain UID, `sample-domain2`, for the new domain.\n+- Using a different (unique) domain name, `domain2`, for the different domains.\n+- Deploying secrets and a model update ConfigMap that are uniquely labeled and named for the new domain.\n+\n+Note that this use case shows Model in Image's unique ability to quickly deploy a copy of a WebLogic domain that has a different WebLogic domain name and domain encryption key. This is a useful capability that is not supported by the Domain in Image domain home source type:\n+\n+- A Domain in Image domain home source type does not support overriding the domain name, but different domain names are necessary when two domains need to interoperate. In this use case, we take advantage of model macros to ensure that its two different domains have a different domain name: \n+\n+  - First, we define the domain name in the model YAML using the `@@ENV:CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME@@` environment variable macro.\n+  - Second, we set the value of the `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME` environment variable differently using the `env` stanza in each domain's domain resource.\n+\n+- Domain in Image requires that its images embed a WebLogic `security/SerializedSystemIni.dat` domain encryption key that cannot be changed for the image (see [why layering matters]({{< relref \"/userguide/cicd/why-layering-matters.md\" >}}) in CI/CD Considerations). This necessarily means that two Domain in Image domains that share the same image have the ability to decrypt each other's encrypted passwords. A Model in Image's domain encryption key, on the other hand, is not embedded in the image and instead, is dynamically and uniquely created each time the domain is started. \n+\n+{{% notice warning %}}\n+Oracle requires interoperating WebLogic domains to have different domain names. This is necessary when two domains communicate, or when a WebLogic Server or WebLogic Java client concurrently connects to multiple domains. \n+{{% /notice %}}\n+\n+Here are the steps for this use case:\n+\n+1. Make sure you have deployed the domain from the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case).\n+\n+1. Create a ConfigMap with the WDT model that contains the data source definition.\n+\n+   Run the following commands:\n+\n+   ```\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create configmap sample-domain2-wdt-config-map \\\n+     --from-file=/tmp/mii-sample/model-configmaps/datasource\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label configmap sample-domain2-wdt-config-map \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain2\n+   ```\n+\n+   If you've created your own data source file in the Update1 use case, then substitute the file name in the `--from-file=` parameter (we suggested `/tmp/mii-sample/mydatasource.yaml` earlier). Note that the `-from-file=` parameter can reference a single file, in which case it puts the designated file in the ConfigMap, or it can reference a directory, in which case it populates the ConfigMap with all of the files in the designated directory.\n+\n+   Observations:\n+     - We are leaving the namespace `sample-domain1-ns` unchanged for the ConfigMap because we plan to deploy domain `sample-domain2` to the same namespace as `sample-domain1`.\n+     - We name and label the ConfigMap using its associated domain UID for two reasons:\n+       - To make it obvious which ConfigMap belongs to which domain.\n+       - To make it easier to clean up a domain. Typical cleanup scripts use the `weblogic.domainUID` label as a convenience for finding all resources associated with a domain.\n+     - We use a different ConfigMap for the new domain for two reasons:\n+       - To make it easier to keep the life cycle and/or CI/CD process for the two domains simple and independent.\n+       - To 'future proof' the new domain so that changes to the original domain or new domain's ConfigMap can be independent.\n+\n+\n+1. Create the secrets that are referenced by the WDT model files in the image and ConfigMap; they also will be referenced by the domain resource.\n+\n+   Run the following commands:\n+   ```\n+   $ # spec.webLogicCredentialsSecret\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create secret generic \\\n+     sample-domain2-weblogic-credentials \\\n+      --from-literal=username=weblogic --from-literal=password=welcome1\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label  secret \\\n+     sample-domain2-weblogic-credentials \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain2\n+\n+   $ # spec.configuration.model.runtimeEncryptionSecret\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create secret generic \\\n+     sample-domain2-runtime-encryption-secret \\\n+      --from-literal=password=my_runtime_password\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label  secret \\\n+     sample-domain2-runtime-encryption-secret \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain2\n+\n+   $ # referenced by spec.configuration.secrets and by the datasource model YAML in the ConfigMap\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create secret generic \\\n+     sample-domain2-datasource-secret \\\n+      --from-literal=password=Oradoc_db1 \\\n+      --from-literal=url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label  secret \\\n+     sample-domain2-datasource-secret \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain2\n+   ```\n+\n+   Observations:\n+     - We are leaving the namespace `sample-domain1-ns` unchanged for each secret because we plan to deploy domain `sample-domain2` to the same namespace as `sample-domain1`.\n+     - We name and label the secrets using their associated domain UID for two reasons:\n+       - To make it obvious which secret belongs to which domain.\n+       - To make it easier to clean up a domain.

We leave it there to demonstrate that the old version can remain in case you want to revert to it. After the new image is applied, you can revert by modifying your model's `configuration.model.configMap` to override the related application path in your image model.\n+\n+Here are the steps for this use case:\n+\n+1. Make sure you have deployed the domain from the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case).\n+\n+2. Create an updated image. \n+\n+   Recall that a goal of the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) was to demonstrate using the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image named `model-in-image:WLS-v1` from files that were staged in `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image:WLS-v1/`. The staged files included a web application in a WDT ZIP archive, and WDT model configuration for a WebLogic Administration Server called `admin-server` and a WebLogic cluster called `cluster-1`. The final image was called `model-in-image:WLS-v1` and, in addition to having a copy of the staged files in its `/u01/wdt/models` directory, also contained a WebLogic installation and a WebLogic Deploy Tooling installation.\n+\n+   In this use case, we will follow similar steps to the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) in order to create a new image with an updated application and model, plus deploy the updated model and application to the running [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case) domain.\n+\n+   - Understanding our updated WDT archive.\n+\n+     The updated archive for this use case is in directory `/tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v2`. We will use it to create an archive ZIP file for the image. This archive is similar to the `/tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v1` from the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) with the the following differences:\n+     - It includes an updated version of the application in `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2` (while keeping the original application in directory `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v1`).\n+     - The application in `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2/myapp_war/index.jsp` contains a single difference from the original application: it changes the line `out.println(\"Hello World! This is version 'v1' of the mii-sample JSP web-app.\");` to `out.println(\"Hello World! This is version 'v2' of the mii-sample JSP web-app.\");`.\n+\n+     For additional information about archives, see the [Understanding our first archive](#understanding-our-first-archive) section in the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) within this sample.\n+\n+   - Stage a ZIP file of the WDT archive.\n+\n+     > **Note**: If you are using JRF in this sample, substitute `JRF` for each occurrence of `WLS` in the paths below.\n+\n+     When we create our updated image, we will use the files in staging directory `/tmp/mii-sample/model-in-image__WLS-v2`. In preparation, we need it to contain a ZIP file of the new WDT application archive.\n+\n+     Run the following commands to create your application archive ZIP file and put it in the expected directory:\n+\n+     ```\n+     # Delete existing archive.zip in case we have an old leftover version\n+     $ rm -f /tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip\n+\n+     # Move to the directory which contains the source files for our new archive\n+     $ cd /tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v2\n+\n+     # Zip the archive to the location will later use when we run the WebLogic Image Tool\n+     $ zip -r /tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip wlsdeploy\n+     ```\n+\n+   - Understanding our staged model files.\n+\n+     The WDT model YAML file and properties for this use case have already been staged for you to directory `/tmp/mii-sample/model-in-image__WLS-v2`. \n+\n+     The `model.10.yaml` file in this directory has an updated path `wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2` that references the updated web application in our archive, but is otherwise identical to the model staged for the original image. The final related YAML stanza looks like this:\n+\n+     ```\n+     appDeployments:\n+         Application:\n+             myapp:\n+                 SourcePath: 'wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2'\n+                 ModuleType: ear\n+                 Target: 'cluster-1'\n+     ```\n+\n+     If you would like to review the entire original model before this change, see [Staging model files](#staging-model-files) in the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) within this sample.\n+\n+   - Create a new image from our staged model files using WIT.\n+\n+     > **Note**: If you are using JRF in this sample, substitute `JRF` for each occurrence of `WLS` in the `imagetool` command line below, plus substitute `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4` for the `--fromImage` value.\n+\n+     At this point, we have staged all of the files needed for image `model-in-image:WLS-v2`, they include:\n+\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/weblogic-deploy.zip`\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.yaml`\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.properties`\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip`\n+\n+     If you don't see the `weblogic-deploy.zip` file, then it means that you missed a step in the prerequisites.\n+\n+     Now let's use the Image Tool to create an image named `model-in-image:WLS-v2` that's layered on a base WebLogic image. We've already set up this tool during the prerequisite steps at the beginning of this sample.\n+\n+     Run the following commands to create the model image and verify that it worked:\n+\n+     ```\n+     $ cd /tmp/mii-sample/model-images\n+     $ ./imagetool/bin/imagetool.sh update \\\n+       --tag model-in-image:WLS-v2 \\\n+       --fromImage container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4 \\\n+       --wdtModel      ./model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.yaml \\\n+       --wdtVariables  ./model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.properties \\\n+       --wdtArchive    ./model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip \\\n+       --wdtModelOnly \\\n+       --wdtDomainType WLS\n+     ```\n+\n+     If you don't see the `imagetool` directory, then it means that you missed a step in the prerequisites.\n+\n+     This command runs the WebLogic Image Tool in its Model in Image mode, and does the following:\n+     - Builds the final Docker image as a layer on the `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4` base image.\n+     - Copies the WDT ZIP file that's referenced in the WIT cache into the image.\n+       - Note that we cached WDT in WIT using the keyword `latest` when we set up the cache during the sample prerequisites steps.\n+       - This lets WIT implicitly assume it's the desired WDT version and removes the need to pass a `-wdtVersion` flag.\n+     - Copies the specified WDT model, properties, and application archives to image location `/u01/wdt/models`.\n+\n+     When the command succeeds, it should end with output like:\n+\n+     ```\n+     [INFO   ] Build successful. Build time=36s. Image tag=model-in-image:WLS-v2\n+     ```\n+\n+     Also, if you run the `docker images` command, then you should see a Docker image named `model-in-image:WLS-v2`.\n+\n+1. Set up and apply a domain resource that is similar to your \"Update1\" use case domain resource but with a different image:\n+\n+   > **Note**: If you are using JRF in this sample, substitute `JRF` for each occurrence of `WLS` in the paths, files, and image names below.\n+\n+   - Option 1: Update a copy of your domain resource file from the \"Update1\" use case.\n+\n+     - You might recall that in the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case) we suggested creating a file named `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-update1.yaml` or using the `/tmp/mii-sample/domain-resources/WLS/mii-update1-d1-WLS-v1-ds.yaml` file that is supplied with the sample.\n+\n+       - We suggest copying this domain resource file and naming the copy `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-update3.yaml` before making any changes.\n+\n+       - Working on a copy is not strictly necessary, but it helps to keep track of your work for the different use cases in this sample and also provides you a backup of your previous work.\n+\n+     - Change the `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-update3.yaml` domain resource `image` field to reference `model-in-image:WLS-v2` instead of `model-in-image:WLS-v1`.\n+\n+        The final result should look something like this:\n+\n+        ```\n+        ...\n+        spec:\n+          ...\n+          image: \"model-in-image:WLS-v2\"\n+        ```\n+\n+      - Apply your changed domain resource:\n+\n+          ```\n+          $ kubectl apply -f /tmp/mii-sample/mii-update3.yaml\n+          ```\n+\n+    - Option 2: Use the updated domain resource file that is supplied with the sample:\n+\n+        ```\n+        $ kubectl apply -f /tmp/miisample/domain-resources/WLS/mii-update3-d1-WLS-v2-ds.yaml\n+        ```\n+\n+\n+1. Wait for the roll to complete.\n+\n+   Now that you've applied a domain resource with an updated image, the operator should automatically rerun the domain's introspector job in order to generate a new domain home, and then should restart ('roll') each of the domain's pods so that they use the new domain home and the new image. You'll need to wait for this roll to complete before we can verify that the new image and its associated new application have been deployed.\n+\n+   - One way to do this is to call `kubectl get pods -n sample-domain1-ns --watch` and wait for the pods to cycle back to their `ready` state.\n+\n+   - Alternatively, you can run `/tmp/mii-sample/utils/wl-pod-wait.sh -p 3`. This is a utility script that provides useful information about a domain's pods and waits for them to reach a `ready` state, reach their target `restartVersion`, and reach their target `image` before exiting.\n+\n+     {{%expand \"Click here to expand the `wl-pod-wait.sh` usage.\" %}}\n+   ```\n+     $ ./wl-pod-wait.sh -?\n+\n+       Usage:\n+\n+         wl-pod-wait.sh [-n mynamespace] [-d mydomainuid] \\\n+            [-p expected_pod_count] \\\n+            [-t timeout_secs] \\\n+            [-q]\n+\n+         Exits non-zero if 'timeout_secs' is reached before 'pod_count' is reached.\n+\n+       Parameters:\n+\n+         -d <domain_uid> : Defaults to 'sample-domain1'.\n+\n+         -n <namespace>  : Defaults to 'sample-domain1-ns'.\n+\n+         pod_count > 0   : Wait until exactly 'pod_count' WebLogic server pods for\n+                           a domain all (a) are ready, (b) have the same\n+                           'domainRestartVersion' label value as the\n+                           current domain resource's 'spec.restartVersion, and\n+                           (c) have the same image as the current domain\n+                           resource's image.\n+\n+         pod_count = 0   : Wait until there are no running WebLogic server pods\n+                           for a domain.

It does this by:\n+\n+- Using the same image, image model YAML, and application archive as the Initial and Update1 use cases.\n+- Using the same model update ConfigMap source file as the Update1 use case (a data source).\n+- Using a different (unique) domain UID, `sample-domain2`, for the new domain.\n+- Using a different (unique) domain name, `domain2`, for the different domains.\n+- Deploying secrets and a model update ConfigMap that are uniquely labeled and named for the new domain.\n+\n+Note that this use case shows Model in Image's unique ability to quickly deploy a copy of a WebLogic domain that has a different WebLogic domain name and domain encryption key. This is a useful capability that is not supported by the Domain in Image domain home source type:\n+\n+- A Domain in Image domain home source type does not support overriding the domain name, but different domain names are necessary when two domains need to interoperate. In this use case, we take advantage of model macros to ensure that its two different domains have a different domain name: \n+\n+  - First, we define the domain name in the model YAML using the `@@ENV:CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME@@` environment variable macro.\n+  - Second, we set the value of the `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME` environment variable differently using the `env` stanza in each domain's domain resource.\n+\n+- Domain in Image requires that its images embed a WebLogic `security/SerializedSystemIni.dat` domain encryption key that cannot be changed for the image (see [why layering matters]({{< relref \"/userguide/cicd/why-layering-matters.md\" >}}) in CI/CD Considerations). This necessarily means that two Domain in Image domains that share the same image have the ability to decrypt each other's encrypted passwords. A Model in Image's domain encryption key, on the other hand, is not embedded in the image and instead, is dynamically and uniquely created each time the domain is started. \n+\n+{{% notice warning %}}\n+Oracle requires interoperating WebLogic domains to have different domain names. This is necessary when two domains communicate, or when a WebLogic Server or WebLogic Java client concurrently connects to multiple domains. \n+{{% /notice %}}\n+\n+Here are the steps for this use case:\n+\n+1. Make sure you have deployed the domain from the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case).\n+\n+1. Create a ConfigMap with the WDT model that contains the data source definition.\n+\n+   Run the following commands:\n+\n+   ```\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns create configmap sample-domain2-wdt-config-map \\\n+     --from-file=/tmp/mii-sample/model-configmaps/datasource\n+   $ kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns label configmap sample-domain2-wdt-config-map \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=sample-domain2\n+   ```\n+\n+   If you've created your own data source file in the Update1 use case, then substitute the file name in the `--from-file=` parameter (we suggested `/tmp/mii-sample/mydatasource.yaml` earlier). Note that the `-from-file=` parameter can reference a single file, in which case it puts the designated file in the ConfigMap, or it can reference a directory, in which case it populates the ConfigMap with all of the files in the designated directory.\n+\n+   Observations:\n+     - We are leaving the namespace `sample-domain1-ns` unchanged for the ConfigMap because we plan to deploy domain `sample-domain2` to the same namespace as `sample-domain1`.\n+     - We name and label the ConfigMap using its associated domain UID for two reasons:\n+       - To make it obvious which ConfigMap belongs to which domain.\n+       - To make it easier to clean up a domain. Typical cleanup scripts use the `weblogic.domainUID` label as a convenience for finding all resources associated with a domain.\n+     - We use a different ConfigMap for the new domain for two reasons:\n+       - To make it easier to keep the life cycle and/or CI/CD process for the two domains simple and independent.\n+       - To 'future proof' the new domain so that changes to the original domain or new domain's ConfigMap can be independent.\n+\n+\n+1.

We leave it there to demonstrate that the old version can remain in case you want to revert to it. After the new image is applied, you can revert by modifying your model's `configuration.model.configMap` to override the related application path in your image model.\n+\n+Here are the steps for this use case:\n+\n+1. Make sure you have deployed the domain from the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case).\n+\n+2. Create an updated image. \n+\n+   Recall that a goal of the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) was to demonstrate using the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image named `model-in-image:WLS-v1` from files that were staged in `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image:WLS-v1/`. The staged files included a web application in a WDT ZIP archive, and WDT model configuration for a WebLogic Administration Server called `admin-server` and a WebLogic cluster called `cluster-1`. The final image was called `model-in-image:WLS-v1` and, in addition to having a copy of the staged files in its `/u01/wdt/models` directory, also contained a WebLogic installation and a WebLogic Deploy Tooling installation.\n+\n+   In this use case, we will follow similar steps to the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) in order to create a new image with an updated application and model, plus deploy the updated model and application to the running [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case) domain.\n+\n+   - Understanding our updated WDT archive.\n+\n+     The updated archive for this use case is in directory `/tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v2`. We will use it to create an archive ZIP file for the image. This archive is similar to the `/tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v1` from the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) with the the following differences:\n+     - It includes an updated version of the application in `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2` (while keeping the original application in directory `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v1`).\n+     - The application in `./wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2/myapp_war/index.jsp` contains a single difference from the original application: it changes the line `out.println(\"Hello World! This is version 'v1' of the mii-sample JSP web-app.\");` to `out.println(\"Hello World! This is version 'v2' of the mii-sample JSP web-app.\");`.\n+\n+     For additional information about archives, see the [Understanding our first archive](#understanding-our-first-archive) section in the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) within this sample.\n+\n+   - Stage a ZIP file of the WDT archive.\n+\n+     > **Note**: If you are using JRF in this sample, substitute `JRF` for each occurrence of `WLS` in the paths below.\n+\n+     When we create our updated image, we will use the files in staging directory `/tmp/mii-sample/model-in-image__WLS-v2`. In preparation, we need it to contain a ZIP file of the new WDT application archive.\n+\n+     Run the following commands to create your application archive ZIP file and put it in the expected directory:\n+\n+     ```\n+     # Delete existing archive.zip in case we have an old leftover version\n+     $ rm -f /tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip\n+\n+     # Move to the directory which contains the source files for our new archive\n+     $ cd /tmp/mii-sample/archives/archive-v2\n+\n+     # Zip the archive to the location will later use when we run the WebLogic Image Tool\n+     $ zip -r /tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip wlsdeploy\n+     ```\n+\n+   - Understanding our staged model files.\n+\n+     The WDT model YAML file and properties for this use case have already been staged for you to directory `/tmp/mii-sample/model-in-image__WLS-v2`. \n+\n+     The `model.10.yaml` file in this directory has an updated path `wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2` that references the updated web application in our archive, but is otherwise identical to the model staged for the original image. The final related YAML stanza looks like this:\n+\n+     ```\n+     appDeployments:\n+         Application:\n+             myapp:\n+                 SourcePath: 'wlsdeploy/applications/myapp-v2'\n+                 ModuleType: ear\n+                 Target: 'cluster-1'\n+     ```\n+\n+     If you would like to review the entire original model before this change, see [Staging model files](#staging-model-files) in the [Initial use case](#initial-use-case) within this sample.\n+\n+   - Create a new image from our staged model files using WIT.\n+\n+     > **Note**: If you are using JRF in this sample, substitute `JRF` for each occurrence of `WLS` in the `imagetool` command line below, plus substitute `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4` for the `--fromImage` value.\n+\n+     At this point, we have staged all of the files needed for image `model-in-image:WLS-v2`, they include:\n+\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/weblogic-deploy.zip`\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.yaml`\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.properties`\n+     - `/tmp/mii-sample/model-images/model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip`\n+\n+     If you don't see the `weblogic-deploy.zip` file, then it means that you missed a step in the prerequisites.\n+\n+     Now let's use the Image Tool to create an image named `model-in-image:WLS-v2` that's layered on a base WebLogic image. We've already set up this tool during the prerequisite steps at the beginning of this sample.\n+\n+     Run the following commands to create the model image and verify that it worked:\n+\n+     ```\n+     $ cd /tmp/mii-sample/model-images\n+     $ ./imagetool/bin/imagetool.sh update \\\n+       --tag model-in-image:WLS-v2 \\\n+       --fromImage container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4 \\\n+       --wdtModel      ./model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.yaml \\\n+       --wdtVariables  ./model-in-image__WLS-v2/model.10.properties \\\n+       --wdtArchive    ./model-in-image__WLS-v2/archive.zip \\\n+       --wdtModelOnly \\\n+       --wdtDomainType WLS\n+     ```\n+\n+     If you don't see the `imagetool` directory, then it means that you missed a step in the prerequisites.\n+\n+     This command runs the WebLogic Image Tool in its Model in Image mode, and does the following:\n+     - Builds the final Docker image as a layer on the `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4` base image.\n+     - Copies the WDT ZIP file that's referenced in the WIT cache into the image.\n+       - Note that we cached WDT in WIT using the keyword `latest` when we set up the cache during the sample prerequisites steps.\n+       - This lets WIT implicitly assume it's the desired WDT version and removes the need to pass a `-wdtVersion` flag.\n+     - Copies the specified WDT model, properties, and application archives to image location `/u01/wdt/models`.\n+\n+     When the command succeeds, it should end with output like:\n+\n+     ```\n+     [INFO   ] Build successful. Build time=36s. Image tag=model-in-image:WLS-v2\n+     ```\n+\n+     Also, if you run the `docker images` command, then you should see a Docker image named `model-in-image:WLS-v2`.\n+\n+1. Set up and apply a domain resource that is similar to your \"Update1\" use case domain resource but with a different image:\n+\n+   > **Note**: If you are using JRF in this sample, substitute `JRF` for each occurrence of `WLS` in the paths, files, and image names below.\n+\n+   - Option 1: Update a copy of your domain resource file from the \"Update1\" use case.\n+\n+     - You might recall that in the [Update1 use case](#update1-use-case) we suggested creating a file named `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-update1.yaml` or using the `/tmp/mii-sample/domain-resources/WLS/mii-update1-d1-WLS-v1-ds.yaml` file that is supplied with the sample.\n+\n+       - We suggest copying this domain resource file and naming the copy `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-update3.yaml` before making any changes.\n+\n+       - Working on a copy is not strictly necessary, but it helps to keep track of your work for the different use cases in this sample and also provides you a backup of your previous work.\n+\n+     - Change the `/tmp/mii-sample/mii-update3.yaml` domain resource `image` field to reference `model-in-image:WLS-v2` instead of `model-in-image:WLS-v1`.\n+\n+        The final result should look something like this:\n+\n+        ```\n+        ...\n+        spec:\n+          ...\n+          image: \"model-in-image:WLS-v2\"\n+        ```\n+\n+      - Apply your changed domain resource:\n+\n+          ```\n+          $ kubectl apply -f /tmp/mii-sample/mii-update3.yaml\n+          ```\n+\n+    - Option 2: Use the updated domain resource file that is supplied with the sample:\n+\n+        ```\n+        $ kubectl apply -f /tmp/miisample/domain-resources/WLS/mii-update3-d1-WLS-v2-ds.yaml\n+        ```\n+\n+\n+1. Wait for the roll to complete.\n+\n+   Now that you've applied a domain resource with an updated image, the operator should automatically rerun the domain's introspector job in order to generate a new domain home, and then should restart ('roll') each of the domain's pods so that they use the new domain home and the new image. You'll need to wait for this roll to complete before we can verify that the new image and its associated new application have been deployed.\n+\n+   - One way to do this is to call `kubectl get pods -n sample-domain1-ns --watch` and wait for the pods to cycle back to their `ready` state.\n+\n+   - Alternatively, you can run `/tmp/mii-sample/utils/wl-pod-wait.sh -p 3`. This is a utility script that provides useful information about a domain's pods and waits for them to reach a `ready` state, reach their target `restartVersion`, and reach their target `image` before exiting.\n+\n+     {{%expand \"Click here to expand the `wl-pod-wait.sh` usage.\" %}}\n+   ```\n+     $ ./wl-pod-wait.sh -?\n+\n+       Usage:\n+\n+         wl-pod-wait.sh [-n mynamespace] [-d mydomainuid] \\\n+            [-p expected_pod_count] \\\n+            [-t timeout_secs] \\\n+            [-q]\n+\n+         Exits non-zero if 'timeout_secs' is reached before 'pod_count' is reached.\n+\n+       Parameters:\n+\n+         -d <domain_uid> : Defaults to 'sample-domain1'.\n+\n+         -n <namespace>  : Defaults to 'sample-domain1-ns'.\n+\n+         pod_count > 0   : Wait until exactly 'pod_count' WebLogic server pods for\n+                           a domain all (a) are ready, (b) have the same\n+                           'domainRestartVersion' label value as the\n+                           current domain resource's 'spec.restartVersion, and\n+                           (c) have the same image as the current domain\n+                           resource's image.\n+\n+         pod_count = 0   : Wait until there are no running WebLogic server pods\n+                           for a domain.
