The WDT Discover tool will generate a WDT model yaml (metadata representation of the domain configuration)\n+and a properties file properties file which will contain a key=value for each property in the WDT model.\n+The sample has been enhanced to update the domain using both the WDT Update and the WDT Extract Domain Resource Tools.\n+\n+New functionality for the Domain Home on PV sample:\n+1- The create domain script will use the WDT Extract Domain Resource Tool to generate the domain CR yaml (domain.yaml).\n+2- The ability to update the domain on PV which was originally created as described above using WDT. The domain\n+   configuration will be updated by running WDT Update Tool using a WDT full model and the equivalent change to\n+   the Domain CR using the WDT Extract Domain Resource Tool.\n+3- The create and update domain will accept the following inputs: a WDT model, and the WDT properties file\n+    (e.g. generated during WDT discovery).\n+\n+Note: You can still create the domain by updating the create-domain-inputs yaml file.\n+\n+This sample has been modified to create a domain on PV and also to update the domain using the new WDT model.\n+The updateDomain is only to be used with domain created using WDT\n+\n+Use case - WDT can be used to discover an domain (could be on-prem).

The user is expected to fill in the information identified by --FIX ME--\n+      in the domain resource output.
