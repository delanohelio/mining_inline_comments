Yes, I'm familiar with the style we used for the MII user guide docs (and others) but don't find it appropriate here. The introductory document in the sample provides adequate TOC and navigation for all the other sections. Adding an index page with a one line description of the other docs (which are self-explanatory, such as prerequisites, initial use case, update 1, etc.) adds only more clicks for the user to get where they're going. Considering that this sample already has seven docs associated with it, I don't think that we need to add more. Of course, however, I am open minded to hear other opinions. Last, I will concede to your idea of putting the References at the end of the first document; they got lost and were less useful after the Cleanup.", "url": "https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/pull/1719#discussion_r443622889", "createdAt": "2020-06-22T14:58:46Z", "author": {"login": "rosemarymarano"}, "path": "docs-source/content/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -5,9 +5,6 @@ weight: 4\n description: \"Sample for supplying a WebLogic Deploy Tooling (WDT) model that the operator expands into a full domain home during runtime.\"\n ---\n ", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzODE2Nzc4MQ=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "83fa77303c2e4b417d0d2f72bec4ba6eeb047dd4"}, "originalPosition": 3}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0MzYyOTQ3OA==", "bodyText": "I don't have a strong objection to keeping the re-org 'as-is'.
