Using the Istio gateway will enable you to view the\n+traffic in Kiali and to use distributed tracing all the way from the entry point to\n+the cluster, for example, the Istio gateway.\n+\n+To configure external access to your domain, you need to create an Istio `Gateway` and\n+`Virtualservice` as shown in the example below:\n+\n+```\n+---\n+apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3\n+kind: Gateway\n+metadata:\n+  name: domain1-gateway\n+  namespace: domain1\n+spec:\n+  selector:\n+    istio: ingressgateway\n+  servers:\n+    - hosts:\n+        - '*'\n+      port:\n+        name: http\n+        number: 80\n+        protocol: HTTP\n+---\n+apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3\n+kind: VirtualService\n+metadata:\n+  name: domain1-virtualservice\n+  namespace: domain1\n+spec:\n+  gateways:\n+    - domain1-gateway\n+  hosts:\n+    - '*'\n+  http:\n+    - match:\n+        - uri:\n+            prefix: /console\n+        - port: 7001\n+      route:\n+        - destination:\n+            host: sample-domain1-admin-server.sample-domain1-ns.svc.cluster.local\n+            port:\n+              number: 7001\n+    - match:\n+        - uri:\n+            prefix: /testwebapp\n+        - port: 8001\n+      route:\n+        - destination:\n+            host: sample-domain1-cluster-cluster-1.domain1.svc.cluster.local\n+            port:\n+              number: 8001\n+```\n+\n+This example creates a gateway that will accept requests with any host name\n+using HTTP on port 80, and a virtual service that will route all of\n+those requests to the cluster service for `cluster-1` in `domain1` in\n+the namespace `domain1`.\n+\n+Once the gateway and virtual service has been setup, you can access it through your ingress host and port, \n+refer to [Determining the ingress IP and ports](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/getting-started/#determining-the-ingress-ip-and-ports)\n+\n+\n+For more information about providing ingress using Istio, refer to the [Istio documentation](https://istio.io/docs/tasks/traffic-management/ingress/).\n+\n+#### Traffic management\n+\n+Istio provides traffic management capabilities, including the ability to\n+visualize traffic in Kiali.  You do not need to change your applications to use\n+this feature.  The Istio proxy (envoy) sidecar that is injected into your pods\n+provides this visibility. The Istio support enables\n+traffic management.
