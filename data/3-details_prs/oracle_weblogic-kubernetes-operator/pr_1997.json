For each cluster, the operator will sort cluster member Managed Server names from the WebLogic domain configuration by normalizing any numbers in the Managed Server name and then sorting alphabetically. This is done so that server names such as \"managed-server10\" come after \"managed-server9\". The operator will then start Managed Servers from the sorted list, up to the `replicas` count, unless specific Managed Servers are specified as starting in their entry under the `managedServers` field. In that case, the specified Managed Servers will be started and then additional cluster members will be started, up to the `replicas` count, by finding further cluster members in the sorted list that are not already started.
