These items do not need to be created in order.\n+\n+#### 1. WebLogic Kubernetes Operator\n+\n+Deploy the operator and ensure that it is monitoring the desired namespace for your Model in Image domain. See [Manage operators]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-operators/_index.md\" >}}) and [Quick Start]({{< relref \"/quickstart/_index.md\" >}}).\n+\n+#### 2. WebLogic Server image\n+\n+Model in Image requires creating a 'final' deployable image that has WebLogic Server and WDT installed, plus your model and application files.\n+\n+You can start with a WebLogic Server 12.2.1.3 or later pre-built base image obtained from [Docker Hub](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/master/OracleWebLogic) or similar, manually build your own base image as per [Preparing a Base Image]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-in-image/base-images/_index.md\" >}}), or build a base image using the [WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool). Note that any 12.2.1.3 image must also include patch 29135930 (the pre-built images already contain this patch). For an example of the first approach for both WLS and JRF domains, see the [Model in Image]({{< relref \"/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) sample.\n+\n+After you have a base image, Model in Image requires layering the following directory structure for its (optional) WDT models artifacts and (required) WDT binaries:\n+\n+| Directory                | Contents                           | Extension   |\n+| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------- |\n+| `/u01/wdt/models`         | Optional domain model YAML files   | .yaml       |\n+| `/u01/wdt/models`         | Optional model variable files      | .properties |\n+| `/u01/wdt/models`         | Optional application archives      | .zip        |\n+| `/u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy`| Unzipped WebLogic deploy install   |             |\n+\n+There are two methods for layering Model in Image artifacts on top of a base image:\n+\n+  - **Manual Image Creation**: Use Docker commands to layer the WDT artifacts from the above table on top of your base image into a new image.\n+\n+  - **WebLogic Image Tool**: Use the convenient [WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool). The WebLogic Image Tool (WIT) has built-in options for embedding WDT model files, WDT binaries, WebLogic Server binaries, and WebLogic Server patches in an image. The [Model in Image]({{< relref \"/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) sample uses the WIT approach. For an example, see the sample's `build_image_model.sh` file in the operator source's `kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image` directory.\n+\n+For a discussion of model file syntax, see [Model files]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md\" >}}).\n+\n+#### 3. Optional WDT model config map\n+\n+You can create a WDT model config map that defines additional model `.yaml` and `.properties` files beyond what you've already supplied in your image, and then reference this config map using your domain resource's `configuration.model.configMap` attribute. This is optional if the supplied image already fully defines your model.\n+\n+WDT model config map files will be merged with the WDT files defined in your image at runtime before your domain home is created. The config map files can add to, remove from, or alter the model configuration that you supplied within your image.\n+\n+For example, place additional `.yaml` and `.properties` files in a directory called `/home/acmeuser/wdtoverride` and run the following commands:\n+\n+  ```\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    create configmap MY-DOMAINUID-my-wdt-config-map \\\n+    --from-file /home/acmeuser/wdtoverride\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    label  configmap MY-DOMAINUID-my-wdt-config-map \\\n+    weblogic.domainUID=MY-DOMAINUID\n+  ```\n+\n+See [Model files]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md\" >}}) for a discussion of model file syntax and loading order, and see [Runtime updates]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/runtime-updates.md\" >}}) for a discussion of using WDT model config maps to update the model configuration of a running domain.\n+\n+\n+#### 4. Required runtime encryption secret\n+\n+Model in Image requires a runtime encryption secret with a secure `password` key. This secret is used by the operator to encrypt model and domain home artifacts before it adds them to a runtime config map or log. The `password` that you set can safely change any time after you've fully shut down a domain but must remain the same for the life of a running domain. The runtime encryption secret that you create can be named anything but note that it is a best practice to name and label secrets with their domain UID to help ensure that cleanup scripts can find and delete them.\n+\n+**NOTE**: Because the runtime encryption password does not need to be shared and only needs to exist for the life of a domain, you may want to use a password generator.\n+\n+Example:\n+\n+  ```\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    create secret generic MY-DOMAINUID-runtime-encrypt-secret \\\n+    --from-literal=password=welcome1\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    label secret MY-DOMAINUID-runtime-encrypt-secret \\\n+    weblogic.domainUID=MY-DOMAINUID\n+  ```\n+\n+Corresponding domain resource snippet:\n+\n+  ```\n+  configuration:\n+    model:\n+      runtimeEncryptionSecret: MY-DOMAINUID-runtime-encrypt-secret\n+  ```\n+\n+#### 5. Secrets for model macros\n+\n+Create additional secrets as needed by macros in your model files. For example, these can store database URLs and credentials that are accessed using `@@SECRET` macros in your model that reference the secrets.  For a discussion of model macros, see [Model files]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md\" >}}).\n+\n+#### 6. Domain resource attributes\n+\n+The following domain resource attributes are specific to Model in Image domains.\n+\n+| Domain Resource Attribute                    |  Notes |\n+| -------------------------                    |  ------------------ |\n+| `domainHomeSourceType`                       |  Required. Set to `FromModel`. |\n+| `domainHome`                                 |  Must reference an empty or non-existent directory within your image. Do not include the mount path of any persistent volume. Note that Model in Image recreates the domain home for a WebLogic pod every time the pod restarts.|\n+| `configuration.model.configMap`             | Optional. Set if you have stored additional models in a config map as per [Optional WDT model config map](#3-optional-wdt-model-config-map). |\n+| `configuration.secrets`                      | Optional. Set this array if your image or config map models contain macros that reference custom Kubernetes secrets. For example, if your macros depend on secrets `my-secret` and `my-other-secret`, then set to `[my-secret, my-other-secret]`.|\n+| `configuration.model.runtimeEncryptionSecret`| Required. All Model in Image domains must specify a runtime encryption secret. See [Required runtime encryption secret](#4-required-runtime-encryption-secret). |\n+| `configuration.model.domainType`             | Set the type of domain. Valid values are `WLS`, `JRF`, and `RestrictedJRF` where `WLS` is the default. See [WDT Domain Types](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling/blob/master/site/type_def.md).|\n+\n+Notes:\n+\n+ - There are additional attributes that are common to all domain home source types, such as the `image` field. See the Domain Resource [schema](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/blob/master/docs/domains/Domain.md) and [documentation]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-resource.md\" >}}) for a full list of domain resource fields.\n+\n+ - There are also additional fields that are specific to JRF domain types. For more information, see [Prerequisites for JRF domain types](#7-prerequisites-for-jrf-domain-types).\n+\n+ - Sample domain resource: For an example of a fully specified sample domain resource, see the the operator source's `kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image/k8s-domain.yaml.template` file for the [Model in Image]({{< relref \"/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) sample. Note that the `@@` entries in this template are not processed by the operator; they need to replaced with actual values before the resource can be applied.\n+\n+#### 7.

These items do not need to be created in order.\n+\n+#### 1. WebLogic Kubernetes Operator\n+\n+Deploy the operator and ensure that it is monitoring the desired namespace for your Model in Image domain. See [Manage operators]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-operators/_index.md\" >}}) and [Quick Start]({{< relref \"/quickstart/_index.md\" >}}).\n+\n+#### 2. WebLogic Server image\n+\n+Model in Image requires creating a 'final' deployable image that has WebLogic Server and WDT installed, plus your model and application files.\n+\n+You can start with a WebLogic Server 12.2.1.3 or later pre-built base image obtained from [Docker Hub](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/master/OracleWebLogic) or similar, manually build your own base image as per [Preparing a Base Image]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-in-image/base-images/_index.md\" >}}), or build a base image using the [WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool). Note that any 12.2.1.3 image must also include patch 29135930 (the pre-built images already contain this patch). For an example of the first approach for both WLS and JRF domains, see the [Model in Image]({{< relref \"/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) sample.\n+\n+After you have a base image, Model in Image requires layering the following directory structure for its (optional) WDT models artifacts and (required) WDT binaries:\n+\n+| Directory                | Contents                           | Extension   |\n+| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------- |\n+| `/u01/wdt/models`         | Optional domain model YAML files   | .yaml       |\n+| `/u01/wdt/models`         | Optional model variable files      | .properties |\n+| `/u01/wdt/models`         | Optional application archives      | .zip        |\n+| `/u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy`| Unzipped WebLogic deploy install   |             |\n+\n+There are two methods for layering Model in Image artifacts on top of a base image:\n+\n+  - **Manual Image Creation**: Use Docker commands to layer the WDT artifacts from the above table on top of your base image into a new image.\n+\n+  - **WebLogic Image Tool**: Use the convenient [WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool). The WebLogic Image Tool (WIT) has built-in options for embedding WDT model files, WDT binaries, WebLogic Server binaries, and WebLogic Server patches in an image. The [Model in Image]({{< relref \"/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) sample uses the WIT approach. For an example, see the sample's `build_image_model.sh` file in the operator source's `kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image` directory.\n+\n+For a discussion of model file syntax, see [Model files]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md\" >}}).\n+\n+#### 3. Optional WDT model config map\n+\n+You can create a WDT model config map that defines additional model `.yaml` and `.properties` files beyond what you've already supplied in your image, and then reference this config map using your domain resource's `configuration.model.configMap` attribute. This is optional if the supplied image already fully defines your model.\n+\n+WDT model config map files will be merged with the WDT files defined in your image at runtime before your domain home is created. The config map files can add to, remove from, or alter the model configuration that you supplied within your image.\n+\n+For example, place additional `.yaml` and `.properties` files in a directory called `/home/acmeuser/wdtoverride` and run the following commands:\n+\n+  ```\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    create configmap MY-DOMAINUID-my-wdt-config-map \\\n+    --from-file /home/acmeuser/wdtoverride\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    label  configmap MY-DOMAINUID-my-wdt-config-map \\\n+    weblogic.domainUID=MY-DOMAINUID\n+  ```\n+\n+See [Model files]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md\" >}}) for a discussion of model file syntax and loading order, and see [Runtime updates]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/runtime-updates.md\" >}}) for a discussion of using WDT model config maps to update the model configuration of a running domain.\n+\n+\n+#### 4. Required runtime encryption secret\n+\n+Model in Image requires a runtime encryption secret with a secure `password` key. This secret is used by the operator to encrypt model and domain home artifacts before it adds them to a runtime config map or log. The `password` that you set can safely change any time after you've fully shut down a domain but must remain the same for the life of a running domain. The runtime encryption secret that you create can be named anything but note that it is a best practice to name and label secrets with their domain UID to help ensure that cleanup scripts can find and delete them.\n+\n+**NOTE**: Because the runtime encryption password does not need to be shared and only needs to exist for the life of a domain, you may want to use a password generator.\n+\n+Example:\n+\n+  ```\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    create secret generic MY-DOMAINUID-runtime-encrypt-secret \\\n+    --from-literal=password=welcome1\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    label secret MY-DOMAINUID-runtime-encrypt-secret \\\n+    weblogic.domainUID=MY-DOMAINUID\n+  ```\n+\n+Corresponding domain resource snippet:\n+\n+  ```\n+  configuration:\n+    model:\n+      runtimeEncryptionSecret: MY-DOMAINUID-runtime-encrypt-secret\n+  ```\n+\n+#### 5. Secrets for model macros\n+\n+Create additional secrets as needed by macros in your model files. For example, these can store database URLs and credentials that are accessed using `@@SECRET` macros in your model that reference the secrets.  For a discussion of model macros, see [Model files]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md\" >}}).\n+\n+#### 6. Domain resource attributes\n+\n+The following domain resource attributes are specific to Model in Image domains.\n+\n+| Domain Resource Attribute                    |  Notes |\n+| -------------------------                    |  ------------------ |\n+| `domainHomeSourceType`                       |  Required.

These items do not need to be created in order.\n+\n+#### 1. WebLogic Kubernetes Operator\n+\n+Deploy the operator and ensure that it is monitoring the desired namespace for your Model in Image domain. See [Manage operators]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-operators/_index.md\" >}}) and [Quick Start]({{< relref \"/quickstart/_index.md\" >}}).\n+\n+#### 2. WebLogic Server image\n+\n+Model in Image requires creating a 'final' deployable image that has WebLogic Server and WDT installed, plus your model and application files.\n+\n+You can start with a WebLogic Server 12.2.1.3 or later pre-built base image obtained from [Docker Hub](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/master/OracleWebLogic) or similar, manually build your own base image as per [Preparing a Base Image]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-in-image/base-images/_index.md\" >}}), or build a base image using the [WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool). Note that any 12.2.1.3 image must also include patch 29135930 (the pre-built images already contain this patch). For an example of the first approach for both WLS and JRF domains, see the [Model in Image]({{< relref \"/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) sample.\n+\n+After you have a base image, Model in Image requires layering the following directory structure for its (optional) WDT models artifacts and (required) WDT binaries:\n+\n+| Directory                | Contents                           | Extension   |\n+| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------- |\n+| `/u01/wdt/models`         | Optional domain model YAML files   | .yaml       |\n+| `/u01/wdt/models`         | Optional model variable files      | .properties |\n+| `/u01/wdt/models`         | Optional application archives      | .zip        |\n+| `/u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy`| Unzipped WebLogic deploy install   |             |\n+\n+There are two methods for layering Model in Image artifacts on top of a base image:\n+\n+  - **Manual Image Creation**: Use Docker commands to layer the WDT artifacts from the above table on top of your base image into a new image.\n+\n+  - **WebLogic Image Tool**: Use the convenient [WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool). The WebLogic Image Tool (WIT) has built-in options for embedding WDT model files, WDT binaries, WebLogic Server binaries, and WebLogic Server patches in an image. The [Model in Image]({{< relref \"/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) sample uses the WIT approach. For an example, see the sample's `build_image_model.sh` file in the operator source's `kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image` directory.\n+\n+For a discussion of model file syntax, see [Model files]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md\" >}}).\n+\n+#### 3. Optional WDT model config map\n+\n+You can create a WDT model config map that defines additional model `.yaml` and `.properties` files beyond what you've already supplied in your image, and then reference this config map using your domain resource's `configuration.model.configMap` attribute. This is optional if the supplied image already fully defines your model.\n+\n+WDT model config map files will be merged with the WDT files defined in your image at runtime before your domain home is created. The config map files can add to, remove from, or alter the model configuration that you supplied within your image.\n+\n+For example, place additional `.yaml` and `.properties` files in a directory called `/home/acmeuser/wdtoverride` and run the following commands:\n+\n+  ```\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    create configmap MY-DOMAINUID-my-wdt-config-map \\\n+    --from-file /home/acmeuser/wdtoverride\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    label  configmap MY-DOMAINUID-my-wdt-config-map \\\n+    weblogic.domainUID=MY-DOMAINUID\n+  ```\n+\n+See [Model files]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md\" >}}) for a discussion of model file syntax and loading order, and see [Runtime updates]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/runtime-updates.md\" >}}) for a discussion of using WDT model config maps to update the model configuration of a running domain.\n+\n+\n+#### 4. Required runtime encryption secret\n+\n+Model in Image requires a runtime encryption secret with a secure `password` key. This secret is used by the operator to encrypt model and domain home artifacts before it adds them to a runtime config map or log. The `password` that you set can safely change any time after you've fully shut down a domain but must remain the same for the life of a running domain. The runtime encryption secret that you create can be named anything but note that it is a best practice to name and label secrets with their domain UID to help ensure that cleanup scripts can find and delete them.\n+\n+**NOTE**: Because the runtime encryption password does not need to be shared and only needs to exist for the life of a domain, you may want to use a password generator.\n+\n+Example:\n+\n+  ```\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    create secret generic MY-DOMAINUID-runtime-encrypt-secret \\\n+    --from-literal=password=welcome1\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    label secret MY-DOMAINUID-runtime-encrypt-secret \\\n+    weblogic.domainUID=MY-DOMAINUID\n+  ```\n+\n+Corresponding domain resource snippet:\n+\n+  ```\n+  configuration:\n+    model:\n+      runtimeEncryptionSecret: MY-DOMAINUID-runtime-encrypt-secret\n+  ```\n+\n+#### 5. Secrets for model macros\n+\n+Create additional secrets as needed by macros in your model files. For example, these can store database URLs and credentials that are accessed using `@@SECRET` macros in your model that reference the secrets.  For a discussion of model macros, see [Model files]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md\" >}}).\n+\n+#### 6. Domain resource attributes\n+\n+The following domain resource attributes are specific to Model in Image domains.\n+\n+| Domain Resource Attribute                    |  Notes |\n+| -------------------------                    |  ------------------ |\n+| `domainHomeSourceType`                       |  Required. Set to `FromModel`. |\n+| `domainHome`                                 |  Must reference an empty or non-existent directory within your image. Do not include the mount path of any persistent volume. Note that Model in Image recreates the domain home for a WebLogic pod every time the pod restarts.|\n+| `configuration.model.configMap`             | Optional. Set if you have stored additional models in a config map as per [Optional WDT model config map](#3-optional-wdt-model-config-map). |\n+| `configuration.secrets`                      | Optional. Set this array if your image or config map models contain macros that reference custom Kubernetes secrets. For example, if your macros depend on secrets `my-secret` and `my-other-secret`, then set to `[my-secret, my-other-secret]`.|\n+| `configuration.model.runtimeEncryptionSecret`| Required. All Model in Image domains must specify a runtime encryption secret. See [Required runtime encryption secret](#4-required-runtime-encryption-secret). |\n+| `configuration.model.domainType`             | Set the type of domain. Valid values are `WLS`, `JRF`, and `RestrictedJRF` where `WLS` is the default. See [WDT Domain Types](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling/blob/master/site/type_def.md).|\n+\n+Notes:\n+\n+ - There are additional attributes that are common to all domain home source types, such as the `image` field. See the Domain Resource [schema](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/blob/master/docs/domains/Domain.md) and [documentation]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-resource.md\" >}}) for a full list of domain resource fields.\n+\n+ - There are also additional fields that are specific to JRF domain types. For more information, see [Prerequisites for JRF domain types](#7-prerequisites-for-jrf-domain-types).\n+\n+ - Sample domain resource: For an example of a fully specified sample domain resource, see the the operator source's `kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image/k8s-domain.yaml.template` file for the [Model in Image]({{< relref \"/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) sample. Note that the `@@` entries in this template are not processed by the operator; they need to replaced with actual values before the resource can be applied.\n+\n+#### 7. Prerequisites for JRF domain types\n+\n+{{% notice info %}} This section applies only for a `JRF` domain type. Skip it if your domain type is `WLS` or `RestrictedJRF`.\n+{{% /notice %}}\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database called an RCU database, initializing this database, and configuring your domain to access this database. All of these steps must occur before you first deploy your domain. When you first deploy your domain, the introspector job will initialize it's RCU schema tables in the database - a process that can take several minutes.\n+\n+Furthermore, if you want to safely ensure that a restarted JRF domain can access updates to the infrastructure database that the domain made at an earlier time, the original domain's wallet file must be safely saved as soon as practical, and the restarted domain must be supplied a wallet file that was obtained from a previous run of the domain, as discussed in [Reusing an RCU database]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/reusing-rcu.md\" >}}).\n+\n+__Here are the required settings for Model in Image JRF domains:__\n+\n+- Set `configuration.model.domainType` to `JRF`.\n+\n+- Set `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` to reference a secret that defines a `walletPassword` key. This is used to encrypt the domain's OPSS wallet file. This is a required field for JRF domains.\n+\n+- Set `configuration.opss.walletFileSecret` to reference a secret that contains your domain's OPSS wallet file in its `walletFile` key. This assumes you have an OPSS wallet file from a previous start of the same domain. It enables a restarted or migrated domain to access its RCU database information. For more information, see [Reusing an RCU database between domain deployments]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/reusing-rcu.md\" >}}). This is an optional field for JRF domains, but must always be set if you want a restarted or migrated domain to access its RCU database information.\n+\n+- Set the `configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds` introspection job timeout to at least 300. This is in an optional field but is needed because domain home creation takes a considerable amount of time the first time a JRF domain is created (due to initializing the domain's RCU database tables), and because Model in Image creates your domain home for you using the introspection job.\n+\n+- Define an `RCUDbInfo` stanza in your model. Access to an RCU database requires defining a `RCUDbInfo` stanza in your model's `domainInfo` stanza with the necessary information for accessing the domain's schema within the database. Usually this information should be supplied using a secret that you deploy and reference in your domain resource's `configuration.secrets` field. Here's an example `RCUDbInfo` stanza:\n+\n+  ```\n+  domainInfo:\n+      RCUDbInfo:\n+          rcu_prefix:          '@@SECRET:sample-domain1-rcu-access/rcu_prefix@@'\n+          rcu_schema_password: '@@SECRET:sample-domain1-rcu-access/rcu_schema_password@@'\n+          rcu_db_conn_string:  '@@SECRET:sample-domain1-rcu-access/rcu_db_conn_string@@'\n+\n+  ```\n+\n+__Important instructions when changing an RCU schema password:__\n+\n+  {{% notice warning %}}\n+  Carefully follow these instructions in order to prevent unrecoverably locking up your RCU database schema account when changing your RCU schema password.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "62c56ef60b39e04a56307f4ecdc3b3756bdbec7d"}, "originalPosition": 154}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5ODAxMjkzMQ==", "bodyText": "done.", "url": "https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/pull/1478#discussion_r398012931", "createdAt": "2020-03-25T16:54:14Z", "author": {"login": "tbarnes-us"}, "path": "docs-source/content/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/usage.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,173 @@\n++++\n+title = \"Usage\"\n+date = 2020-03-11T16:45:16-05:00\n+weight = 20\n+pre = \"<b> </b>\"\n+description = \"Steps for creating and deploying Model in Image images and their associated domain resources.\"\n++++\n+\n+\n+#### Contents\n+\n+   - [WebLogic Kubernetes Operator](#1-weblogic-kubernetes-operator)\n+   - [WebLogic Server image](#2-weblogic-server-image)\n+   - [Optional WDT model config map](#3-optional-wdt-model-config-map)\n+   - [Required runtime encryption secret](#4-required-runtime-encryption-secret)\n+   - [Secrets for model macros](#5-secrets-for-model-macros)\n+   - [Domain resource attributes](#6-domain-resource-attributes)\n+   - [Prerequisites for JRF domain types](#7-prerequisites-for-jrf-domain-types)\n+\n+#### Requirements\n+\n+Here's what's needed to create and deploy a typical Model in Image domain.

The runtime encryption secret that you create can be named anything but note that it is a best practice to name and label secrets with their domain UID to help ensure that cleanup scripts can find and delete them.\n+\n+**NOTE**: Because the runtime encryption password does not need to be shared and only needs to exist for the life of a domain, you may want to use a password generator.\n+\n+Example:\n+\n+  ```\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    create secret generic MY-DOMAINUID-runtime-encrypt-secret \\\n+    --from-literal=password=welcome1\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    label secret MY-DOMAINUID-runtime-encrypt-secret \\\n+    weblogic.domainUID=MY-DOMAINUID\n+  ```\n+\n+Corresponding domain resource snippet:\n+\n+  ```\n+  configuration:\n+    model:\n+      runtimeEncryptionSecret: MY-DOMAINUID-runtime-encrypt-secret\n+  ```\n+\n+#### 5. Secrets for model macros\n+\n+Create additional secrets as needed by macros in your model files. For example, these can store database URLs and credentials that are accessed using `@@SECRET` macros in your model that reference the secrets.  For a discussion of model macros, see [Model files]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md\" >}}).\n+\n+#### 6. Domain resource attributes\n+\n+The following domain resource attributes are specific to Model in Image domains.\n+\n+| Domain Resource Attribute                    |  Notes |\n+| -------------------------                    |  ------------------ |\n+| `domainHomeSourceType`                       |  Required. Set to `FromModel`. |\n+| `domainHome`                                 |  Must reference an empty or non-existent directory within your image. Do not include the mount path of any persistent volume. Note that Model in Image recreates the domain home for a WebLogic pod every time the pod restarts.|\n+| `configuration.model.configMap`             | Optional. Set if you have stored additional models in a config map as per [Optional WDT model config map](#3-optional-wdt-model-config-map). |\n+| `configuration.secrets`                      | Optional. Set this array if your image or config map models contain macros that reference custom Kubernetes secrets. For example, if your macros depend on secrets `my-secret` and `my-other-secret`, then set to `[my-secret, my-other-secret]`.|\n+| `configuration.model.runtimeEncryptionSecret`| Required. All Model in Image domains must specify a runtime encryption secret. See [Required runtime encryption secret](#4-required-runtime-encryption-secret). |\n+| `configuration.model.domainType`             | Set the type of domain. Valid values are `WLS`, `JRF`, and `RestrictedJRF` where `WLS` is the default. See [WDT Domain Types](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling/blob/master/site/type_def.md).|\n+\n+Notes:\n+\n+ - There are additional attributes that are common to all domain home source types, such as the `image` field. See the Domain Resource [schema](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/blob/master/docs/domains/Domain.md) and [documentation]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-resource.md\" >}}) for a full list of domain resource fields.\n+\n+ - There are also additional fields that are specific to JRF domain types. For more information, see [Prerequisites for JRF domain types](#7-prerequisites-for-jrf-domain-types).\n+\n+ - Sample domain resource: For an example of a fully specified sample domain resource, see the the operator source's `kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image/k8s-domain.yaml.template` file for the [Model in Image]({{< relref \"/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) sample. Note that the `@@` entries in this template are not processed by the operator; they need to replaced with actual values before the resource can be applied.\n+\n+#### 7. Prerequisites for JRF domain types\n+\n+{{% notice info %}} This section applies only for a `JRF` domain type. Skip it if your domain type is `WLS` or `RestrictedJRF`.\n+{{% /notice %}}\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database called an RCU database, initializing this database, and configuring your domain to access this database. All of these steps must occur before you first deploy your domain. When you first deploy your domain, the introspector job will initialize it's RCU schema tables in the database - a process that can take several minutes.\n+\n+Furthermore, if you want to safely ensure that a restarted JRF domain can access updates to the infrastructure database that the domain made at an earlier time, the original domain's wallet file must be safely saved as soon as practical, and the restarted domain must be supplied a wallet file that was obtained from a previous run of the domain, as discussed in [Reusing an RCU database]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/reusing-rcu.md\" >}}).\n+\n+__Here are the required settings for Model in Image JRF domains:__\n+\n+- Set `configuration.model.domainType` to `JRF`.\n+\n+- Set `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` to reference a secret that defines a `walletPassword` key. This is used to encrypt the domain's OPSS wallet file. This is a required field for JRF domains.\n+\n+- Set `configuration.opss.walletFileSecret` to reference a secret that contains your domain's OPSS wallet file in its `walletFile` key. This assumes you have an OPSS wallet file from a previous start of the same domain. It enables a restarted or migrated domain to access its RCU database information. For more information, see [Reusing an RCU database between domain deployments]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/reusing-rcu.md\" >}}). This is an optional field for JRF domains, but must always be set if you want a restarted or migrated domain to access its RCU database information.\n+\n+- Set the `configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds` introspection job timeout to at least 300. This is in an optional field but is needed because domain home creation takes a considerable amount of time the first time a JRF domain is created (due to initializing the domain's RCU database tables), and because Model in Image creates your domain home for you using the introspection job.\n+\n+- Define an `RCUDbInfo` stanza in your model. Access to an RCU database requires defining a `RCUDbInfo` stanza in your model's `domainInfo` stanza with the necessary information for accessing the domain's schema within the database. Usually this information should be supplied using a secret that you deploy and reference in your domain resource's `configuration.secrets` field. Here's an example `RCUDbInfo` stanza:\n+\n+  ```\n+  domainInfo:\n+      RCUDbInfo:\n+          rcu_prefix:          '@@SECRET:sample-domain1-rcu-access/rcu_prefix@@'\n+          rcu_schema_password: '@@SECRET:sample-domain1-rcu-access/rcu_schema_password@@'\n+          rcu_db_conn_string:  '@@SECRET:sample-domain1-rcu-access/rcu_db_conn_string@@'\n+\n+  ```\n+\n+__Important instructions when changing an RCU schema password:__\n+\n+  {{% notice warning %}}\n+  Carefully follow these instructions in order to prevent unrecoverably locking up your RCU database schema account when changing your RCU schema password.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5Nzk5ODg5Ng=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "62c56ef60b39e04a56307f4ecdc3b3756bdbec7d"}, "originalPosition": 154}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMjQ2NzQzNjM1OnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "docs-source/content/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md", "isResolved": false, "comments": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMy0yNVQxNzoxMDowOFrOF7lgKg==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMy0yN1QxNzo0NTo1MFrOF87wiA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5ODAyNDc0Ng==", "bodyText": "so i read this, and it makes no sense to me - what is this file for? what are all these things in here? there is no explanation of what this is", "url": "https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/pull/1478#discussion_r398024746", "createdAt": "2020-03-25T17:10:08Z", "author": {"login": "markxnelson"}, "path": "docs-source/content/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,156 @@\n++++\n+title = \"Model files\"\n+date = 2020-03-11T16:45:16-05:00\n+weight = 30\n+pre = \"<b> </b>\"\n+description = \"Model file requirements, macros, and loading order.\"\n++++\n+\n+#### Contents\n+\n+ - [Introduction](#introduction)\n+ - [Sample model file](#sample-model-file)\n+ - [Important notes about Model in Image model files](#important-notes-about-model-in-image-model-files)\n+ - [Model file naming and loading order](#model-file-naming-and-loading-order)\n+ - [Model file macros](#model-file-macros)\n+   - [Using secrets in model files](#using-secrets-in-model-files)\n+   - [Using environment variables in model files](#using-environment-variables-in-model-files)\n+   - [Combining secrets and environment variables in model files](#combining-secrets-and-environment-variables-in-model-files)\n+\n+#### Introduction\n+\n+This document describes basic Model in Image model file syntax, naming, and macros.

For example:\n+\n+    ```\n+    domainInfo:\n+      AdminUserName: '@@SECRET:__weblogic-credentials__:username@@'\n+      AdminPassword: '@@SECRET:__weblogic-credentials__:password@@'\n+    ```\n+- You can control the order that WDT uses to load your model files, see [Model file naming and loading order](#model-file-naming-and-loading-order).\n+\n+#### Model file naming and loading order\n+\n+Refer to this section if you need to control the order in which your model files are loaded.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5ODAyNTQ3NQ=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "ea9dc9e2db65db8254da52355f83b6f2846a1efd"}, "originalPosition": 87}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMjQ2NzQ0ODcyOnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "docs-source/content/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/reusing-rcu.md", "isResolved": false, "comments": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMy0yNVQxNzoxMjo0NlrOF7ln_w==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNC0wMlQxNDo1Nzo0MlrOF_vW9w==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5ODAyNjc1MQ==", "bodyText": "there is no such thing as \"an RCU database\"", "url": "https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/pull/1478#discussion_r398026751", "createdAt": "2020-03-25T17:12:46Z", "author": {"login": "markxnelson"}, "path": "docs-source/content/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/reusing-rcu.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,53 @@\n++++\n+title = \"Reusing an RCU database\"\n+date = 2020-03-11T16:45:16-05:00\n+weight = 70\n+pre = \"<b> </b>\"\n+description = \"Reusing an RCU database between deployments of a Model in Image JRF domain.\"\n++++\n+\n+#### Reusing an RCU database between JRF domain deployments", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "052184b0304ccd38cbce2ee30853df310456e698"}, "originalPosition": 9}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwMjM4MDUzNQ==", "bodyText": "What is the correct term?", "url": "https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/pull/1478#discussion_r402380535", "createdAt": "2020-04-02T14:57:42Z", "author": {"login": "tbarnes-us"}, "path": "docs-source/content/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/reusing-rcu.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,53 @@\n++++\n+title = \"Reusing an RCU database\"\n+date = 2020-03-11T16:45:16-05:00\n+weight = 70\n+pre = \"<b> </b>\"\n+description = \"Reusing an RCU database between deployments of a Model in Image JRF domain.\"\n++++\n+\n+#### Reusing an RCU database between JRF domain deployments", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5ODAyNjc1MQ=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "052184b0304ccd38cbce2ee30853df310456e698"}, "originalPosition": 9}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMjQ2NzQ1MTc3OnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "docs-source/content/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/reusing-rcu.md", "isResolved": false, "comments": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMy0yNVQxNzoxMzoyOVrOF7lp-Q==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMy0yN1QxOToxMDowNFrOF8-kWg==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5ODAyNzI1Nw==", "bodyText": "the domain will add itself to its tables?\nawkward/confusing wording", "url": "https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/pull/1478#discussion_r398027257", "createdAt": "2020-03-25T17:13:29Z", "author": {"login": "markxnelson"}, "path": "docs-source/content/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/reusing-rcu.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,53 @@\n++++\n+title = \"Reusing an RCU database\"\n+date = 2020-03-11T16:45:16-05:00\n+weight = 70\n+pre = \"<b> </b>\"\n+description = \"Reusing an RCU database between deployments of a Model in Image JRF domain.\"\n++++\n+\n+#### Reusing an RCU database between JRF domain deployments\n+\n+{{% notice info %}} This section only applies for a JRF domain type.

Using the WebLogic Image Tool to create a Docker image that contains a WebLogic install, a WebLogic Deploy Tool (WDT) install, a Java EE servlet application contained within a WDT archive, and the model for a WebLogic domain configuration defined using a WDT model file.\n+  - Modifying the WDT model that's embedded within the Docker image using a WDT model file that's supplied using a Kubernetes config map.\n+  - Defining a `domainHomeSourceType: FromModel` domain resource that references the WDT model image and the WDT config map.\n+  - Deploying the model image, domain resource, model config map, and associated secrets that define user names, passwords, and URL values for the model and its domain resource.\n+  - Deploying and accessing a Traefik load balancer that redirects HTTP protocol calls to its Java EE servlet application.\n+\n+Supported domain types:\n+\n+There are three types of domains supported by Model in Image: a standard `WLS` domain, an Oracle Fusion Middleware Infrastructure Java Required Files (`JRF`) domain, or a `RestrictedJRF` domain.\n+\n+The `JRF` domain path through the sample includes additional steps for deploying an infrastructure database and initializing the database using the Repository Creation Utility (RCU) tool. `JRF` domains may be used by Oracle products that layer on top of WebLogic Server such as SOA and OSB. Similarly, `RestrictedJRF` domains may be used by Oracle layered products such as Oracle Communications products.\n+\n+### References\n+\n+To reference the relevant user documentation, see:\n+ - [Model in Image User Guide]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) user documentation\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Server Deploy Tooling](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling)\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool)\n+\n+\n+\n+### Prerequisites for all domain types\n+\n+1. The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable must be set and must reference a valid JDK 8 installation. (`JAVA_HOME` is used by the WebLogic Image Tool.)\n+\n+2. Set a source directory environment variable `SRCDIR` that references the parent of the operator source tree. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   mkdir ~/wlopsrc\n+   cd ~/wlopsrc\n+   git clone https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator.git\n+   export SRCDIR=$(pwd)/weblogic-kubernetes-operator\n+   ```\n+\n+   We will refer to this environment variable later in this document.\n+\n+   For additional information about obtaining the operator source, see the [Developer Guide Requirements](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/developerguide/requirements/).\n+\n+3. Create a sample directory environment variable `SAMPLEDIR` that references this sample's directory:\n+\n+   ```\n+   export SAMPLEDIR=${SRCDIR}/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image/\n+   ```\n+\n+   We will refer to this environment variable later in this document.\n+\n+4. Create an empty, temporary working directory with 10g of space, and store its location in the `WORKDIR` environment variable. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd <location of empty temporary directory with 10g of space>\n+   export WORKDIR=$(pwd)\n+   ```\n+\n+   We will refer to this environment variable later in this document, and it is used by the sample scripts. If you do not set this environement variable, then the sample scripts will default to `/tmp/$USER/model-in-image-sample-work-dir` where `$USER` is your user name.\n+\n+5. Deploy the operator and set up the operator to manage the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`. Optionally, deploy a Traefik load balancer that manages the same namespace. For example, follow the same steps as the [Quick Start](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/quickstart/), up through the [Prepare for a domain]({{< relref \"/quickstart/prepare.md\" >}}) step.\n+\n+   Note that:\n+   - Deploying the Traefik load balancer is optional, but is a prerequisite for testing the web application that's deployed to WebLogic as part of this sample.\n+   - You can skip the Quick Start steps for obtaining a WebLogic image because you will be creating your own Docker image.\n+\n+\n+6. Choose the type of domain you're going to create: `WLS`, `JRF`, or `RestrictedJRF`, and set the environment variable, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, accordingly. The default is `WLS`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   export WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE=<one of WLS, JRF, or RestrictedJRF>\n+   ```\n+\n+7. Set up access to a base image for this sample that will be used as the base image for creating the final image. Do one of the following:\n+\n+   - __Option 1, download an existing WebLogic image.__\n+\n+     Set up access to this sample's base WebLogic image at the [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com):\n+\n+     a. Use a browser to access [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com).\n+\n+     b. Choose an image location:\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF` domains, select `Middleware`, then `fmw-infrastructure`.\n+       - For `WLS` domains, select `Middleware`, then `weblogic`.\n+\n+     c. Select Sign In and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+     d. Use your terminal to locally log in to Docker: `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+\n+     e. Later, when you run the sample, it will call `docker pull` for your base image based on the domain type.\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4`.\n+       - For `WLS`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4`.\n+\n+   - __Option 2, create your own WebLogic base image.__\n+\n+     Alternatively, you can create your own base image and override the sample's default base image name and tag by exporting the `BASE_IMAGE_NAME` and `BASE_IMAGE_TAG` environment variables prior to running the sample scripts. If you want to create your own base image, see [Preparing a Base Image]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-in-image/base-images/_index.md\" >}}).\n+\n+8. If you are using a `JRF` domain type, then it requires an RCU infrastructure database. See [Prerequisites for JRF Domains](#prerequisites-for-jrf-domains).\n+\n+> __NOTE__: Skip to section [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image) if you're not using a `JRF` domain type.\n+\n+### Prerequisites for JRF domains\n+\n+> __NOTE__: This section is only required for demonstrating a `JRF` domain type. Skip this section and proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image) if your domain type is `WLS` or `RestrictedJRF`.\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database called an RCU database, requires initializing this database, and requires configuring your domain to access this database. All of these steps must occur before you first deploy your domain.\n+\n+Furthermore, if you want to have a restarted JRF domain access updates to the infrastructure database that the domain made at an earlier time, the restarted domain must be supplied a wallet file that was obtained from a previous run of the domain.\n+\n+The following steps demonstrate how to set up an infrastructure database that will work with this sample:\n+\n+  1. [Set up and initialize an RCU database](#set-up-and-initialize-an-rcu-database).\n+  2. [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout).\n+  3. [Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets](#set-up-rcu-model-attributes-domain-resource-attributes-and-secrets).\n+  4. [Reusing or sharing RCU tables](#reusing-or-sharing-rcu-tables).\n+\n+\n+\n+##### Set up and initialize an RCU database\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database and also requires initializing this database with a schema and a set of tables. The following example shows how to set up a sample RCU database and use the RCU tool to create the infrastructure schema for a JRF domain. The RCU database is set up with the following attributes:\n+\n+| Attribute | Value |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| database Kubernetes namespace | `default` |\n+| database Kubernetes pod | `oracle-db` |\n+| database image | `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` |\n+| database password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| infrastructure schema prefix | `FMW1` |\n+| infrastructure schema password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| database URL | `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s` |\n+\n+\n+1. Ensure you have access to the database image, and then deploy it:\n+\n+   - Use a browser to log in to `https://container-registry.oracle.com`, select `database->enterprise` and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+   - Get the database image:\n+     - In the local shell, `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+     - In the local shell, `docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim`.\n+\n+\n+       {{% notice note %}} If a local Docker login and manual pull of `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` is not sufficient (for example, if you are using a remote Kubernetes cluster), then uncomment the `imagePullSecrets` stanza in `$WORKDIR/k8s-db-slim.yaml` and create the image pull secret as follows:\n+\n+              ```\n+              kubectl create secret docker-registry regsecret \\\n+                --docker-server=container-registry.oracle.com \\\n+                --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+                --docker-password=your-password \\\n+                --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+              ```\n+       {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+\n+   - Use the sample script in `$SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service` to create an Oracle database running in the pod, `oracle-db`.\n+\n+      **NOTE**: If your database image access requires the `regsecret` image pull secret that you optionally created above, then pass `-s regsecret` to the `start-db-service.sh` command line.\n+\n+     ```\n+     cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service\n+     start-db-service.sh\n+     ```\n+\n+     This script will deploy a database with the URL, `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`, and administration password, `Oradoc_db1`.\n+\n+     {{% notice warning %}} The Oracle Database Docker images are supported only for non-production use. For more details, see My Oracle Support note: Oracle Support for Database Running on Docker (Doc ID 2216342.1) : All the data is gone when the database is restarted.\n+     {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+     **NOTE**: This step is based on the steps documented in [Run a Database](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/userguide/overview/database/).\n+\n+2. Use the sample script in `SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema` to create the RCU schema with the schema prefix `FMW1`.\n+\n+   Note that this script assumes `Oradoc_db1` is the DBA password, `Oradoc_db1` is the schema password, and that the database URL is `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema\n+   ./create-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1 -i container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4\n+   ```\n+\n+   __NOTE__:  If you need to drop the repository, use this command:\n+\n+   ```\n+   drop-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1\n+   ```\n+\n+\n+##### Increase introspection job timeout\n+\n+Because JRF domain home creation takes a considerable amount of time the first time it is created, and because Model in Image creates your domain home for you using the introspection job, you should increase the timeout for the introspection job. Use the `configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds` in `k8s-domain.yaml.template` to override the default with a value of at least 300 seconds (the default is 120 seconds).  \n+\n+##### Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets\n+\n+To allow Model in Image to access the RCU database and OPSS wallet, it's necessary to set up an RCU access secret and an OPSS secret before deploying your domain. It's also necessary to define an `RCUDbInfo` stanza in your model. The sample already sets up all of these for you.  See:\n+\n+| Sample file | Description |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, with `password=welcome1`. |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, with appropriate values for attributes `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string`. |\n+| `model1.yaml.jrf` | Populates the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string` attributes by referencing their locations in the `sample-domain1-rcu-access` secret. The `build.sh` script uses this model instead of `model.yaml.wls` when the source domain type is `JRF`. |\n+| `k8s-domain.yaml.template` | Ensures that the domain mounts the OPSS key secret by setting the domain resource `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` attribute to `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, and ensures the domain mounts the RCU access secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, for reference by WDT model macros by setting the domain resource `configuration.secrets` attribute. |\n+| `k8s-domain.yaml.template` | Set `configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds` to 300; see [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout). |\n+\n+ **NOTE**: This step is for information purposes only. Do not run the above sample files directly. The sample's main build and run scripts will run them for you.\n+\n+##### Reusing or sharing RCU tables\n+\n+Note that when you succesfully deploy your JRF domain resource for the first time, the introspector job will initialize the RCU tables for the domain using the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza in the WDT model plus the `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` specified in the domain resource. The job will also create a new domain home. Finally, the operator will also capture an OPSS wallet file from the new domain's local directory and place this file in a new Kubernetes config map.\n+\n+There are scenarios when the domain needs to be re-created between updates such as WebLogic credentials are changed, security roles defined in the WDT model have been changed or you want to share the same RCU tables with different domains.  Under these scenarios, the operator needs the `walletPasswordSecret` as well as the OPSS wallet file, together with the exact information in `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` so that the domain can be re-created and access the same set of RCU tables.  Without the wallet file and wallet password, you will not be able to re-create a domain accessing the same set of RCU tables, therefore it is highly recommended to backup the wallet file.\n+\n+To recover a domain's RCU tables between domain restarts or to share an RCU schema between different domains, it is necessary to extract this wallet file from the config map and save the OPSS wallet password secret that was used for the original domain. The wallet password and wallet file are needed again when you recreate the domain or share the database with other domains.\n+\n+To save the wallet file:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -s [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>]\n+```\n+\n+You should back up this file to a safe location that can be retrieved later.\n+\n+To reuse the wallet for subsequent redeployments or share the RCU tables between different domains:\n+\n+1. Store the wallet in a secret:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -r [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>] [-ws <name of the secret. Default DOMAIN_UID-opss-walletfile-secret> ]\n+\n+```\n+\n+2. Modify the domain resource YAML file to provide the secret names:\n+\n+```\n+  configuration:\n+    opss:\n+      # Name of secret with walletPassword for extracting the wallet\n+      walletPasswordSecret: sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret      \n+      # Name of secret with walletFile containing base64 encoded opss wallet\n+      walletFileSecret: sample-domain1-opss-walletfile-secret\n+\n+```\n+\n+See [Reusing an RCU database]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/reusing-rcu.md\" >}}) for instructions.\n+\n+### Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image\n+\n+A Model in Image image must contain a WebLogic install, a WebLogic Deploy Tool install, and your WDT model files. You can use the sample `./build.sh` script to build this image, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Uses `docker pull` to obtain a base image which already contains a WebLogic install. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types) to set up access to the base image.)\n+  - Downloads the latest WebLogic Image Tool and WebLogic Deploy Tool to `WORKDIR`.\n+  - Creates and populates a staging directory `$WORKDIR/models` that contains your WDT model files and WDT application archive.\n+    - Builds  a simple servlet application in `$SAMPLEDIR/sample_app` into a WDT model application archive `$WORKDIR/models/archive1.zip`.\n+    - Copies sample model files from `$SAMPLEDIR/model-in-image` to `$WORKDIR/models`. This uses a model file that is appropriate to the domain type (for example, the `JRF` domain model includes database access configuration).\n+  - Uses the WebLogic Image Tool and the `$WORKDIR/models` staging directory to create a final image named `model-in-image:v1` that layers on the base image. Specifically, it runs the WebLogic Image Tool with its `update` option, which:\n+    - Builds the final image as a layer on the base image.\n+    - Puts a WDT install in image location, `/u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy`.\n+    - Copies the WDT model, properties, and application archive from `$WORDKIR/models` to image location, `/u01/wdt/models`.\n+\n+The script expects `JAVA_HOME`, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).)\n+\n+Run the script:\n+\n+  ```\n+  $SAMPLEDIR/build.sh\n+  ```\n+\n+If you intend to use a remote Docker registry, you need to tag and push the image to the remote Docker registry.\n+\n+1.  Tag the image for the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker tag model-in-image:v1 my.remote.registry.com/model-in-image:v1\n+```\n+\n+2.  Push the image to the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker push my.remote.registry.com/model-in-image:v1\n+```\n+\n+3. Create the pull secret for the remote Docker registry:\n+\n+```\n+ kubectl -n <domain namespace> create secret docker-registry <secret name> \\\n+     --docker-server=my.remote.registry.com \\\n+     --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+     --docker-password=your-password \\\n+     --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+\n+```\n+\n+4. Update the domain template file `$SAMPLEDIR/k8s-domain.yaml.template` to provide the `imagePullSecrets`:\n+\n+```\n+  imagePullSecrets:\n+  - name: <secret name>\n+\n+```\n+\n+This domain template file will be used in the next step ([Create and deploy your Kubernetes resources](#create-and-deploy-your-kubernetes-resources)) when it creates your final domain resource file.\n+\n+5. Export the environment variables for the image name and tag using the same values in step 1:\n+\n+```\n+export MODEL_IMAGE_NAME=\"my.remote.registry.com/model-in-image\"\n+export MODEL_IMAGE_TAG=\"v1\"\n+```\n+\n+These environment variables will be used in the next step ([Create and deploy your Kubernetes resources](#create-and-deploy-your-kubernetes-resources)) when it creates your final domain resource file.\n+\n+### Create and deploy your Kubernetes resources\n+\n+To deploy the sample operator domain and its required Kubernetes resources, use the sample script, `$SAMPLEDIR/run_domain.sh`, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Deletes the domain with a `DomainUID` of `domain1` in the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`, if it already exists.\n+  - Creates a secret containing your WebLogic administrator user name and password.\n+  - Creates a secret containing your Model in Image runtime encryption password:\n+    - All model-in-image domains must supply a runtime encryption secret with a `password` value.\n+    - It is used to encrypt configuration that is passed around internally by the Operator.\n+    - The value must be kept private but can be arbitrary: you can optionally supply a different secret value every time you restart the domain.\n+  - Creates secrets containing your RCU access URL, credentials, and prefix (these are unused unless the domain type is `JRF`).\n+  - Creates a config map containing an additional WDT model properties file, `$SAMPLEDIR/model1.20.properties`.\n+  - Generates a domain resource YAML file, `$WORKDIR/k8s-domain.yaml`, using `$SAMPLEDIR/k8s-domain.yaml.template`.\n+  - Deploys `k8s-domain.yaml`.\n+  - Displays the status of the domain pods.\n+\n+The script expects `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE` and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized.

Similarly, `RestrictedJRF` domains may be used by Oracle layered products such as Oracle Communications products.\n+\n+### References\n+\n+To reference the relevant user documentation, see:\n+ - [Model in Image User Guide]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) user documentation\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Server Deploy Tooling](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling)\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool)\n+\n+\n+\n+### Prerequisites for all domain types\n+\n+1. The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable must be set and must reference a valid JDK 8 installation. (`JAVA_HOME` is used by the WebLogic Image Tool.)\n+\n+2. Set a source directory environment variable `SRCDIR` that references the parent of the operator source tree. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   mkdir ~/wlopsrc\n+   cd ~/wlopsrc\n+   git clone https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator.git\n+   export SRCDIR=$(pwd)/weblogic-kubernetes-operator\n+   ```\n+\n+   We will refer to this environment variable later in this document.\n+\n+   For additional information about obtaining the operator source, see the [Developer Guide Requirements](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/developerguide/requirements/).\n+\n+3. Create a sample directory environment variable `SAMPLEDIR` that references this sample's directory:\n+\n+   ```\n+   export SAMPLEDIR=${SRCDIR}/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image/\n+   ```\n+\n+   We will refer to this environment variable later in this document.\n+\n+4. Create an empty, temporary working directory with 10g of space, and store its location in the `WORKDIR` environment variable. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd <location of empty temporary directory with 10g of space>\n+   export WORKDIR=$(pwd)\n+   ```\n+\n+   We will refer to this environment variable later in this document, and it is used by the sample scripts. If you do not set this environement variable, then the sample scripts will default to `/tmp/$USER/model-in-image-sample-work-dir` where `$USER` is your user name.\n+\n+5. Deploy the operator and set up the operator to manage the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`. Optionally, deploy a Traefik load balancer that manages the same namespace. For example, follow the same steps as the [Quick Start](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/quickstart/), up through the [Prepare for a domain]({{< relref \"/quickstart/prepare.md\" >}}) step.\n+\n+   Note that:\n+   - Deploying the Traefik load balancer is optional, but is a prerequisite for testing the web application that's deployed to WebLogic as part of this sample.\n+   - You can skip the Quick Start steps for obtaining a WebLogic image because you will be creating your own Docker image.\n+\n+\n+6. Choose the type of domain you're going to create: `WLS`, `JRF`, or `RestrictedJRF`, and set the environment variable, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, accordingly. The default is `WLS`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   export WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE=<one of WLS, JRF, or RestrictedJRF>\n+   ```\n+\n+7. Set up access to a base image for this sample that will be used as the base image for creating the final image. Do one of the following:\n+\n+   - __Option 1, download an existing WebLogic image.__\n+\n+     Set up access to this sample's base WebLogic image at the [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com):\n+\n+     a. Use a browser to access [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com).\n+\n+     b. Choose an image location:\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF` domains, select `Middleware`, then `fmw-infrastructure`.\n+       - For `WLS` domains, select `Middleware`, then `weblogic`.\n+\n+     c. Select Sign In and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+     d. Use your terminal to locally log in to Docker: `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+\n+     e. Later, when you run the sample, it will call `docker pull` for your base image based on the domain type.\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4`.\n+       - For `WLS`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4`.\n+\n+   - __Option 2, create your own WebLogic base image.__\n+\n+     Alternatively, you can create your own base image and override the sample's default base image name and tag by exporting the `BASE_IMAGE_NAME` and `BASE_IMAGE_TAG` environment variables prior to running the sample scripts. If you want to create your own base image, see [Preparing a Base Image]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-in-image/base-images/_index.md\" >}}).\n+\n+8.

The following example shows how to set up a sample RCU database and use the RCU tool to create the infrastructure schema for a JRF domain. The RCU database is set up with the following attributes:\n+\n+| Attribute | Value |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| database Kubernetes namespace | `default` |\n+| database Kubernetes pod | `oracle-db` |\n+| database image | `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` |\n+| database password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| infrastructure schema prefix | `FMW1` |\n+| infrastructure schema password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| database URL | `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s` |\n+\n+\n+1. Ensure you have access to the database image, and then deploy it:\n+\n+   - Use a browser to log in to `https://container-registry.oracle.com`, select `database->enterprise` and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+   - Get the database image:\n+     - In the local shell, `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+     - In the local shell, `docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim`.\n+\n+\n+       {{% notice note %}} If a local Docker login and manual pull of `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` is not sufficient (for example, if you are using a remote Kubernetes cluster), then uncomment the `imagePullSecrets` stanza in `$WORKDIR/k8s-db-slim.yaml` and create the image pull secret as follows:\n+\n+              ```\n+              kubectl create secret docker-registry regsecret \\\n+                --docker-server=container-registry.oracle.com \\\n+                --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+                --docker-password=your-password \\\n+                --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+              ```\n+       {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+\n+   - Use the sample script in `$SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service` to create an Oracle database running in the pod, `oracle-db`.\n+\n+      **NOTE**: If your database image access requires the `regsecret` image pull secret that you optionally created above, then pass `-s regsecret` to the `start-db-service.sh` command line.\n+\n+     ```\n+     cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service\n+     start-db-service.sh\n+     ```\n+\n+     This script will deploy a database with the URL, `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`, and administration password, `Oradoc_db1`.\n+\n+     {{% notice warning %}} The Oracle Database Docker images are supported only for non-production use. For more details, see My Oracle Support note: Oracle Support for Database Running on Docker (Doc ID 2216342.1) : All the data is gone when the database is restarted.\n+     {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+     **NOTE**: This step is based on the steps documented in [Run a Database](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/userguide/overview/database/).\n+\n+2. Use the sample script in `SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema` to create the RCU schema with the schema prefix `FMW1`.\n+\n+   Note that this script assumes `Oradoc_db1` is the DBA password, `Oradoc_db1` is the schema password, and that the database URL is `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema\n+   ./create-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1 -i container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4\n+   ```\n+\n+   __NOTE__:  If you need to drop the repository, use this command:\n+\n+   ```\n+   drop-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1\n+   ```\n+\n+\n+##### Increase introspection job timeout\n+\n+Because JRF domain home creation takes a considerable amount of time the first time it is created, and because Model in Image creates your domain home for you using the introspection job, you should increase the timeout for the introspection job. Use the `configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds` in `k8s-domain.yaml.template` to override the default with a value of at least 300 seconds (the default is 120 seconds).  \n+\n+##### Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets\n+\n+To allow Model in Image to access the RCU database and OPSS wallet, it's necessary to set up an RCU access secret and an OPSS secret before deploying your domain. It's also necessary to define an `RCUDbInfo` stanza in your model. The sample already sets up all of these for you.  See:\n+\n+| Sample file | Description |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, with `password=welcome1`. |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, with appropriate values for attributes `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string`. |\n+| `model1.yaml.jrf` | Populates the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string` attributes by referencing their locations in the `sample-domain1-rcu-access` secret. The `build.sh` script uses this model instead of `model.yaml.wls` when the source domain type is `JRF`. |\n+| `k8s-domain.yaml.template` | Ensures that the domain mounts the OPSS key secret by setting the domain resource `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` attribute to `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, and ensures the domain mounts the RCU access secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, for reference by WDT model macros by setting the domain resource `configuration.secrets` attribute. |\n+| `k8s-domain.yaml.template` | Set `configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds` to 300; see [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout). |\n+\n+ **NOTE**: This step is for information purposes only. Do not run the above sample files directly. The sample's main build and run scripts will run them for you.\n+\n+##### Reusing or sharing RCU tables\n+\n+Note that when you succesfully deploy your JRF domain resource for the first time, the introspector job will initialize the RCU tables for the domain using the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza in the WDT model plus the `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` specified in the domain resource. The job will also create a new domain home. Finally, the operator will also capture an OPSS wallet file from the new domain's local directory and place this file in a new Kubernetes config map.\n+\n+There are scenarios when the domain needs to be re-created between updates such as WebLogic credentials are changed, security roles defined in the WDT model have been changed or you want to share the same RCU tables with different domains.  Under these scenarios, the operator needs the `walletPasswordSecret` as well as the OPSS wallet file, together with the exact information in `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` so that the domain can be re-created and access the same set of RCU tables.  Without the wallet file and wallet password, you will not be able to re-create a domain accessing the same set of RCU tables, therefore it is highly recommended to backup the wallet file.\n+\n+To recover a domain's RCU tables between domain restarts or to share an RCU schema between different domains, it is necessary to extract this wallet file from the config map and save the OPSS wallet password secret that was used for the original domain. The wallet password and wallet file are needed again when you recreate the domain or share the database with other domains.\n+\n+To save the wallet file:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -s [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>]\n+```\n+\n+You should back up this file to a safe location that can be retrieved later.\n+\n+To reuse the wallet for subsequent redeployments or share the RCU tables between different domains:\n+\n+1. Store the wallet in a secret:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -r [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>] [-ws <name of the secret. Default DOMAIN_UID-opss-walletfile-secret> ]\n+\n+```\n+\n+2. Modify the domain resource YAML file to provide the secret names:\n+\n+```\n+  configuration:\n+    opss:\n+      # Name of secret with walletPassword for extracting the wallet\n+      walletPasswordSecret: sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret      \n+      # Name of secret with walletFile containing base64 encoded opss wallet\n+      walletFileSecret: sample-domain1-opss-walletfile-secret\n+\n+```\n+\n+See [Reusing an RCU database]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/reusing-rcu.md\" >}}) for instructions.\n+\n+### Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image\n+\n+A Model in Image image must contain a WebLogic install, a WebLogic Deploy Tool install, and your WDT model files. You can use the sample `./build.sh` script to build this image, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Uses `docker pull` to obtain a base image which already contains a WebLogic install. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types) to set up access to the base image.)\n+  - Downloads the latest WebLogic Image Tool and WebLogic Deploy Tool to `WORKDIR`.\n+  - Creates and populates a staging directory `$WORKDIR/models` that contains your WDT model files and WDT application archive.\n+    - Builds  a simple servlet application in `$SAMPLEDIR/sample_app` into a WDT model application archive `$WORKDIR/models/archive1.zip`.\n+    - Copies sample model files from `$SAMPLEDIR/model-in-image` to `$WORKDIR/models`. This uses a model file that is appropriate to the domain type (for example, the `JRF` domain model includes database access configuration).\n+  - Uses the WebLogic Image Tool and the `$WORKDIR/models` staging directory to create a final image named `model-in-image:v1` that layers on the base image. Specifically, it runs the WebLogic Image Tool with its `update` option, which:\n+    - Builds the final image as a layer on the base image.\n+    - Puts a WDT install in image location, `/u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy`.\n+    - Copies the WDT model, properties, and application archive from `$WORDKIR/models` to image location, `/u01/wdt/models`.\n+\n+The script expects `JAVA_HOME`, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).)\n+\n+Run the script:\n+\n+  ```\n+  $SAMPLEDIR/build.sh\n+  ```\n+\n+If you intend to use a remote Docker registry, you need to tag and push the image to the remote Docker registry.\n+\n+1.  Tag the image for the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker tag model-in-image:v1 my.remote.registry.com/model-in-image:v1\n+```\n+\n+2.  Push the image to the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker push my.remote.registry.com/model-in-image:v1\n+```\n+\n+3. Create the pull secret for the remote Docker registry:\n+\n+```\n+ kubectl -n <domain namespace> create secret docker-registry <secret name> \\\n+     --docker-server=my.remote.registry.com \\\n+     --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+     --docker-password=your-password \\\n+     --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+\n+```\n+\n+4. Update the domain template file `$SAMPLEDIR/k8s-domain.yaml.template` to provide the `imagePullSecrets`:\n+\n+```\n+  imagePullSecrets:\n+  - name: <secret name>\n+\n+```\n+\n+This domain template file will be used in the next step ([Create and deploy your Kubernetes resources](#create-and-deploy-your-kubernetes-resources)) when it creates your final domain resource file.\n+\n+5. Export the environment variables for the image name and tag using the same values in step 1:\n+\n+```\n+export MODEL_IMAGE_NAME=\"my.remote.registry.com/model-in-image\"\n+export MODEL_IMAGE_TAG=\"v1\"\n+```\n+\n+These environment variables will be used in the next step ([Create and deploy your Kubernetes resources](#create-and-deploy-your-kubernetes-resources)) when it creates your final domain resource file.\n+\n+### Create and deploy your Kubernetes resources\n+\n+To deploy the sample operator domain and its required Kubernetes resources, use the sample script, `$SAMPLEDIR/run_domain.sh`, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Deletes the domain with a `DomainUID` of `domain1` in the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`, if it already exists.\n+  - Creates a secret containing your WebLogic administrator user name and password.\n+  - Creates a secret containing your Model in Image runtime encryption password:\n+    - All model-in-image domains must supply a runtime encryption secret with a `password` value.\n+    - It is used to encrypt configuration that is passed around internally by the Operator.\n+    - The value must be kept private but can be arbitrary: you can optionally supply a different secret value every time you restart the domain.\n+  - Creates secrets containing your RCU access URL, credentials, and prefix (these are unused unless the domain type is `JRF`).\n+  - Creates a config map containing an additional WDT model properties file, `$SAMPLEDIR/model1.20.properties`.\n+  - Generates a domain resource YAML file, `$WORKDIR/k8s-domain.yaml`, using `$SAMPLEDIR/k8s-domain.yaml.template`.\n+  - Deploys `k8s-domain.yaml`.\n+  - Displays the status of the domain pods.\n+\n+The script expects `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE` and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized.

Similarly, `RestrictedJRF` domains may be used by Oracle layered products such as Oracle Communications products.\n+\n+### References\n+\n+To reference the relevant user documentation, see:\n+ - [Model in Image User Guide]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) user documentation\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Server Deploy Tooling](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling)\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool)\n+\n+\n+\n+### Prerequisites for all domain types\n+\n+1. The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable must be set and must reference a valid JDK 8 installation. (`JAVA_HOME` is used by the WebLogic Image Tool.)\n+\n+2. Set a source directory environment variable `SRCDIR` that references the parent of the operator source tree. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   mkdir ~/wlopsrc\n+   cd ~/wlopsrc\n+   git clone https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator.git\n+   export SRCDIR=$(pwd)/weblogic-kubernetes-operator\n+   ```\n+\n+   We will refer to this environment variable later in this document.\n+\n+   For additional information about obtaining the operator source, see the [Developer Guide Requirements](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/developerguide/requirements/).\n+\n+3. Create a sample directory environment variable `SAMPLEDIR` that references this sample's directory:\n+\n+   ```\n+   export SAMPLEDIR=${SRCDIR}/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image/\n+   ```\n+\n+   We will refer to this environment variable later in this document.\n+\n+4. Create an empty, temporary working directory with 10g of space, and store its location in the `WORKDIR` environment variable. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd <location of empty temporary directory with 10g of space>\n+   export WORKDIR=$(pwd)\n+   ```\n+\n+   We will refer to this environment variable later in this document, and it is used by the sample scripts. If you do not set this environement variable, then the sample scripts will default to `/tmp/$USER/model-in-image-sample-work-dir` where `$USER` is your user name.\n+\n+5. Deploy the operator and set up the operator to manage the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`. Optionally, deploy a Traefik load balancer that manages the same namespace. For example, follow the same steps as the [Quick Start](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/quickstart/), up through the [Prepare for a domain]({{< relref \"/quickstart/prepare.md\" >}}) step.\n+\n+   Note that:\n+   - Deploying the Traefik load balancer is optional, but is a prerequisite for testing the web application that's deployed to WebLogic as part of this sample.\n+   - You can skip the Quick Start steps for obtaining a WebLogic image because you will be creating your own Docker image.\n+\n+\n+6. Choose the type of domain you're going to create: `WLS`, `JRF`, or `RestrictedJRF`, and set the environment variable, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, accordingly. The default is `WLS`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   export WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE=<one of WLS, JRF, or RestrictedJRF>\n+   ```\n+\n+7. Set up access to a base image for this sample that will be used as the base image for creating the final image. Do one of the following:\n+\n+   - __Option 1, download an existing WebLogic image.__\n+\n+     Set up access to this sample's base WebLogic image at the [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com):\n+\n+     a. Use a browser to access [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com).\n+\n+     b. Choose an image location:\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF` domains, select `Middleware`, then `fmw-infrastructure`.\n+       - For `WLS` domains, select `Middleware`, then `weblogic`.\n+\n+     c. Select Sign In and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+     d. Use your terminal to locally log in to Docker: `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+\n+     e. Later, when you run the sample, it will call `docker pull` for your base image based on the domain type.\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4`.\n+       - For `WLS`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4`.\n+\n+   - __Option 2, create your own WebLogic base image.__\n+\n+     Alternatively, you can create your own base image and override the sample's default base image name and tag by exporting the `BASE_IMAGE_NAME` and `BASE_IMAGE_TAG` environment variables prior to running the sample scripts. If you want to create your own base image, see [Preparing a Base Image]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-in-image/base-images/_index.md\" >}}).\n+\n+8. If you are using a `JRF` domain type, then it requires an RCU infrastructure database. See [Prerequisites for JRF Domains](#prerequisites-for-jrf-domains).\n+\n+> __NOTE__: Skip to section [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image) if you're not using a `JRF` domain type.\n+\n+### Prerequisites for JRF domains\n+\n+> __NOTE__: This section is only required for demonstrating a `JRF` domain type. Skip this section and proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image) if your domain type is `WLS` or `RestrictedJRF`.\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database called an RCU database, requires initializing this database, and requires configuring your domain to access this database. All of these steps must occur before you first deploy your domain.\n+\n+Furthermore, if you want to have a restarted JRF domain access updates to the infrastructure database that the domain made at an earlier time, the restarted domain must be supplied a wallet file that was obtained from a previous run of the domain.\n+\n+The following steps demonstrate how to set up an infrastructure database that will work with this sample:\n+\n+  1. [Set up and initialize an RCU database](#set-up-and-initialize-an-rcu-database).\n+  2. [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout).\n+  3.

[Reusing or sharing RCU tables](#reusing-or-sharing-rcu-tables).\n+\n+\n+\n+##### Set up and initialize an RCU database\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database and also requires initializing this database with a schema and a set of tables. The following example shows how to set up a sample RCU database and use the RCU tool to create the infrastructure schema for a JRF domain. The RCU database is set up with the following attributes:\n+\n+| Attribute | Value |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| database Kubernetes namespace | `default` |\n+| database Kubernetes pod | `oracle-db` |\n+| database image | `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` |\n+| database password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| infrastructure schema prefix | `FMW1` |\n+| infrastructure schema password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| database URL | `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s` |\n+\n+\n+1. Ensure you have access to the database image, and then deploy it:\n+\n+   - Use a browser to log in to `https://container-registry.oracle.com`, select `database->enterprise` and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+   - Get the database image:\n+     - In the local shell, `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+     - In the local shell, `docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim`.\n+\n+\n+       {{% notice note %}} If a local Docker login and manual pull of `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` is not sufficient (for example, if you are using a remote Kubernetes cluster), then uncomment the `imagePullSecrets` stanza in `$WORKDIR/k8s-db-slim.yaml` and create the image pull secret as follows:\n+\n+              ```\n+              kubectl create secret docker-registry regsecret \\\n+                --docker-server=container-registry.oracle.com \\\n+                --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+                --docker-password=your-password \\\n+                --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+              ```\n+       {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+\n+   - Use the sample script in `$SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service` to create an Oracle database running in the pod, `oracle-db`.\n+\n+      **NOTE**: If your database image access requires the `regsecret` image pull secret that you optionally created above, then pass `-s regsecret` to the `start-db-service.sh` command line.\n+\n+     ```\n+     cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service\n+     start-db-service.sh\n+     ```\n+\n+     This script will deploy a database with the URL, `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`, and administration password, `Oradoc_db1`.\n+\n+     {{% notice warning %}} The Oracle Database Docker images are supported only for non-production use.

Use the sample script in `SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema` to create the RCU schema with the schema prefix `FMW1`.\n+\n+   Note that this script assumes `Oradoc_db1` is the DBA password, `Oradoc_db1` is the schema password, and that the database URL is `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema\n+   ./create-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1 -i container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4\n+   ```\n+\n+   __NOTE__:  If you need to drop the repository, use this command:\n+\n+   ```\n+   drop-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1\n+   ```\n+\n+\n+##### Increase introspection job timeout\n+\n+Because JRF domain home creation takes a considerable amount of time the first time it is created, and because Model in Image creates your domain home for you using the introspection job, you should increase the timeout for the introspection job. Use the `configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds` in `k8s-domain.yaml.template` to override the default with a value of at least 300 seconds (the default is 120 seconds).  \n+\n+##### Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets\n+\n+To allow Model in Image to access the RCU database and OPSS wallet, it's necessary to set up an RCU access secret and an OPSS secret before deploying your domain. It's also necessary to define an `RCUDbInfo` stanza in your model. The sample already sets up all of these for you.  See:\n+\n+| Sample file | Description |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, with `password=welcome1`. |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, with appropriate values for attributes `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string`. |\n+| `model1.yaml.jrf` | Populates the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string` attributes by referencing their locations in the `sample-domain1-rcu-access` secret. The `build.sh` script uses this model instead of `model.yaml.wls` when the source domain type is `JRF`. |\n+| `k8s-domain.yaml.template` | Ensures that the domain mounts the OPSS key secret by setting the domain resource `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` attribute to `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, and ensures the domain mounts the RCU access secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, for reference by WDT model macros by setting the domain resource `configuration.secrets` attribute. |\n+| `k8s-domain.yaml.template` | Set `configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds` to 300; see [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout). |\n+\n+ **NOTE**: This step is for information purposes only. Do not run the above sample files directly. The sample's main build and run scripts will run them for you.\n+\n+##### Reusing or sharing RCU tables\n+\n+Note that when you succesfully deploy your JRF domain resource for the first time, the introspector job will initialize the RCU tables for the domain using the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza in the WDT model plus the `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` specified in the domain resource. The job will also create a new domain home. Finally, the operator will also capture an OPSS wallet file from the new domain's local directory and place this file in a new Kubernetes config map.\n+\n+There are scenarios when the domain needs to be re-created between updates such as WebLogic credentials are changed, security roles defined in the WDT model have been changed or you want to share the same RCU tables with different domains.  Under these scenarios, the operator needs the `walletPasswordSecret` as well as the OPSS wallet file, together with the exact information in `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` so that the domain can be re-created and access the same set of RCU tables.  Without the wallet file and wallet password, you will not be able to re-create a domain accessing the same set of RCU tables, therefore it is highly recommended to backup the wallet file.\n+\n+To recover a domain's RCU tables between domain restarts or to share an RCU schema between different domains, it is necessary to extract this wallet file from the config map and save the OPSS wallet password secret that was used for the original domain. The wallet password and wallet file are needed again when you recreate the domain or share the database with other domains.\n+\n+To save the wallet file:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -s [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>]\n+```\n+\n+You should back up this file to a safe location that can be retrieved later.\n+\n+To reuse the wallet for subsequent redeployments or share the RCU tables between different domains:\n+\n+1. Store the wallet in a secret:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -r [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>] [-ws <name of the secret. Default DOMAIN_UID-opss-walletfile-secret> ]\n+\n+```\n+\n+2. Modify the domain resource YAML file to provide the secret names:\n+\n+```\n+  configuration:\n+    opss:\n+      # Name of secret with walletPassword for extracting the wallet\n+      walletPasswordSecret: sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret      \n+      # Name of secret with walletFile containing base64 encoded opss wallet\n+      walletFileSecret: sample-domain1-opss-walletfile-secret\n+\n+```\n+\n+See [Reusing an RCU database]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/reusing-rcu.md\" >}}) for instructions.\n+\n+### Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image\n+\n+A Model in Image image must contain a WebLogic install, a WebLogic Deploy Tool install, and your WDT model files. You can use the sample `./build.sh` script to build this image, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Uses `docker pull` to obtain a base image which already contains a WebLogic install. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types) to set up access to the base image.)\n+  - Downloads the latest WebLogic Image Tool and WebLogic Deploy Tool to `WORKDIR`.\n+  - Creates and populates a staging directory `$WORKDIR/models` that contains your WDT model files and WDT application archive.\n+    - Builds  a simple servlet application in `$SAMPLEDIR/sample_app` into a WDT model application archive `$WORKDIR/models/archive1.zip`.\n+    - Copies sample model files from `$SAMPLEDIR/model-in-image` to `$WORKDIR/models`. This uses a model file that is appropriate to the domain type (for example, the `JRF` domain model includes database access configuration).\n+  - Uses the WebLogic Image Tool and the `$WORKDIR/models` staging directory to create a final image named `model-in-image:v1` that layers on the base image. Specifically, it runs the WebLogic Image Tool with its `update` option, which:\n+    - Builds the final image as a layer on the base image.\n+    - Puts a WDT install in image location, `/u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy`.\n+    - Copies the WDT model, properties, and application archive from `$WORDKIR/models` to image location, `/u01/wdt/models`.\n+\n+The script expects `JAVA_HOME`, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).)\n+\n+Run the script:\n+\n+  ```\n+  $SAMPLEDIR/build.sh\n+  ```\n+\n+If you intend to use a remote Docker registry, you need to tag and push the image to the remote Docker registry.\n+\n+1.  Tag the image for the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker tag model-in-image:v1 my.remote.registry.com/model-in-image:v1\n+```\n+\n+2.  Push the image to the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker push my.remote.registry.com/model-in-image:v1\n+```\n+\n+3. Create the pull secret for the remote Docker registry:\n+\n+```\n+ kubectl -n <domain namespace> create secret docker-registry <secret name> \\\n+     --docker-server=my.remote.registry.com \\\n+     --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+     --docker-password=your-password \\\n+     --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+\n+```\n+\n+4. Update the domain template file `$SAMPLEDIR/k8s-domain.yaml.template` to provide the `imagePullSecrets`:\n+\n+```\n+  imagePullSecrets:\n+  - name: <secret name>\n+\n+```\n+\n+This domain template file will be used in the next step ([Create and deploy your Kubernetes resources](#create-and-deploy-your-kubernetes-resources)) when it creates your final domain resource file.\n+\n+5. Export the environment variables for the image name and tag using the same values in step 1:\n+\n+```\n+export MODEL_IMAGE_NAME=\"my.remote.registry.com/model-in-image\"\n+export MODEL_IMAGE_TAG=\"v1\"\n+```\n+\n+These environment variables will be used in the next step ([Create and deploy your Kubernetes resources](#create-and-deploy-your-kubernetes-resources)) when it creates your final domain resource file.\n+\n+### Create and deploy your Kubernetes resources\n+\n+To deploy the sample operator domain and its required Kubernetes resources, use the sample script, `$SAMPLEDIR/run_domain.sh`, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Deletes the domain with a `DomainUID` of `domain1` in the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`, if it already exists.\n+  - Creates a secret containing your WebLogic administrator user name and password.\n+  - Creates a secret containing your Model in Image runtime encryption password:\n+    - All model-in-image domains must supply a runtime encryption secret with a `password` value.\n+    - It is used to encrypt configuration that is passed around internally by the Operator.\n+    - The value must be kept private but can be arbitrary: you can optionally supply a different secret value every time you restart the domain.\n+  - Creates secrets containing your RCU access URL, credentials, and prefix (these are unused unless the domain type is `JRF`).\n+  - Creates a config map containing an additional WDT model properties file, `$SAMPLEDIR/model1.20.properties`.\n+  - Generates a domain resource YAML file, `$WORKDIR/k8s-domain.yaml`, using `$SAMPLEDIR/k8s-domain.yaml.template`.\n+  - Deploys `k8s-domain.yaml`.\n+  - Displays the status of the domain pods.\n+\n+The script expects `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE` and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized.

Similarly, `RestrictedJRF` domains may be used by Oracle layered products such as Oracle Communications products.\n+\n+### References\n+\n+To reference the relevant user documentation, see:\n+ - [Model in Image User Guide]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) user documentation\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Server Deploy Tooling](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling)\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool)\n+\n+\n+\n+### Prerequisites for all domain types\n+\n+1. The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable must be set and must reference a valid JDK 8 installation. (`JAVA_HOME` is used by the WebLogic Image Tool.)\n+\n+2. Set a source directory environment variable `SRCDIR` that references the parent of the operator source tree. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   mkdir ~/wlopsrc\n+   cd ~/wlopsrc\n+   git clone https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator.git\n+   export SRCDIR=$(pwd)/weblogic-kubernetes-operator\n+   ```\n+\n+   We will refer to this environment variable later in this document.\n+\n+   For additional information about obtaining the operator source, see the [Developer Guide Requirements](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/developerguide/requirements/).\n+\n+3. Create a sample directory environment variable `SAMPLEDIR` that references this sample's directory:\n+\n+   ```\n+   export SAMPLEDIR=${SRCDIR}/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image/\n+   ```\n+\n+   We will refer to this environment variable later in this document.\n+\n+4. Create an empty, temporary working directory with 10g of space, and store its location in the `WORKDIR` environment variable. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd <location of empty temporary directory with 10g of space>\n+   export WORKDIR=$(pwd)\n+   ```\n+\n+   We will refer to this environment variable later in this document, and it is used by the sample scripts. If you do not set this environement variable, then the sample scripts will default to `/tmp/$USER/model-in-image-sample-work-dir` where `$USER` is your user name.\n+\n+5. Deploy the operator and set up the operator to manage the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`. Optionally, deploy a Traefik load balancer that manages the same namespace. For example, follow the same steps as the [Quick Start](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/quickstart/), up through the [Prepare for a domain]({{< relref \"/quickstart/prepare.md\" >}}) step.\n+\n+   Note that:\n+   - Deploying the Traefik load balancer is optional, but is a prerequisite for testing the web application that's deployed to WebLogic as part of this sample.\n+   - You can skip the Quick Start steps for obtaining a WebLogic image because you will be creating your own Docker image.\n+\n+\n+6. Choose the type of domain you're going to create: `WLS`, `JRF`, or `RestrictedJRF`, and set the environment variable, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, accordingly. The default is `WLS`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   export WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE=<one of WLS, JRF, or RestrictedJRF>\n+   ```\n+\n+7. Set up access to a base image for this sample that will be used as the base image for creating the final image. Do one of the following:\n+\n+   - __Option 1, download an existing WebLogic image.__\n+\n+     Set up access to this sample's base WebLogic image at the [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com):\n+\n+     a. Use a browser to access [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com).\n+\n+     b. Choose an image location:\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF` domains, select `Middleware`, then `fmw-infrastructure`.\n+       - For `WLS` domains, select `Middleware`, then `weblogic`.\n+\n+     c. Select Sign In and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+     d. Use your terminal to locally log in to Docker: `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+\n+     e. Later, when you run the sample, it will call `docker pull` for your base image based on the domain type.\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4`.\n+       - For `WLS`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4`.\n+\n+   - __Option 2, create your own WebLogic base image.__\n+\n+     Alternatively, you can create your own base image and override the sample's default base image name and tag by exporting the `BASE_IMAGE_NAME` and `BASE_IMAGE_TAG` environment variables prior to running the sample scripts. If you want to create your own base image, see [Preparing a Base Image]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-in-image/base-images/_index.md\" >}}).\n+\n+8. If you are using a `JRF` domain type, then it requires an RCU infrastructure database. See [Prerequisites for JRF Domains](#prerequisites-for-jrf-domains).\n+\n+> __NOTE__: Skip to section [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image) if you're not using a `JRF` domain type.\n+\n+### Prerequisites for JRF domains\n+\n+> __NOTE__: This section is only required for demonstrating a `JRF` domain type. Skip this section and proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image) if your domain type is `WLS` or `RestrictedJRF`.\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database called an RCU database, requires initializing this database, and requires configuring your domain to access this database. All of these steps must occur before you first deploy your domain.\n+\n+Furthermore, if you want to have a restarted JRF domain access updates to the infrastructure database that the domain made at an earlier time, the restarted domain must be supplied a wallet file that was obtained from a previous run of the domain.\n+\n+The following steps demonstrate how to set up an infrastructure database that will work with this sample:\n+\n+  1. [Set up and initialize an RCU database](#set-up-and-initialize-an-rcu-database).\n+  2. [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout).\n+  3. [Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets](#set-up-rcu-model-attributes-domain-resource-attributes-and-secrets).\n+  4. [Reusing or sharing RCU tables](#reusing-or-sharing-rcu-tables).\n+\n+\n+\n+##### Set up and initialize an RCU database\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database and also requires initializing this database with a schema and a set of tables. The following example shows how to set up a sample RCU database and use the RCU tool to create the infrastructure schema for a JRF domain. The RCU database is set up with the following attributes:\n+\n+| Attribute | Value |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| database Kubernetes namespace | `default` |\n+| database Kubernetes pod | `oracle-db` |\n+| database image | `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` |\n+| database password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| infrastructure schema prefix | `FMW1` |\n+| infrastructure schema password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| database URL | `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s` |\n+\n+\n+1. Ensure you have access to the database image, and then deploy it:\n+\n+   - Use a browser to log in to `https://container-registry.oracle.com`, select `database->enterprise` and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+   - Get the database image:\n+     - In the local shell, `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+     - In the local shell, `docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim`.\n+\n+\n+       {{% notice note %}} If a local Docker login and manual pull of `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` is not sufficient (for example, if you are using a remote Kubernetes cluster), then uncomment the `imagePullSecrets` stanza in `$WORKDIR/k8s-db-slim.yaml` and create the image pull secret as follows:\n+\n+              ```\n+              kubectl create secret docker-registry regsecret \\\n+                --docker-server=container-registry.oracle.com \\\n+                --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+                --docker-password=your-password \\\n+                --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+              ```\n+       {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+\n+   - Use the sample script in `$SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service` to create an Oracle database running in the pod, `oracle-db`.\n+\n+      **NOTE**: If your database image access requires the `regsecret` image pull secret that you optionally created above, then pass `-s regsecret` to the `start-db-service.sh` command line.\n+\n+     ```\n+     cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service\n+     start-db-service.sh\n+     ```\n+\n+     This script will deploy a database with the URL, `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`, and administration password, `Oradoc_db1`.\n+\n+     {{% notice warning %}} The Oracle Database Docker images are supported only for non-production use. For more details, see My Oracle Support note: Oracle Support for Database Running on Docker (Doc ID 2216342.1) : All the data is gone when the database is restarted.\n+     {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+     **NOTE**: This step is based on the steps documented in [Run a Database](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/userguide/overview/database/).\n+\n+2. Use the sample script in `SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema` to create the RCU schema with the schema prefix `FMW1`.\n+\n+   Note that this script assumes `Oradoc_db1` is the DBA password, `Oradoc_db1` is the schema password, and that the database URL is `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema\n+   ./create-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1 -i container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4\n+   ```\n+\n+   __NOTE__:  If you need to drop the repository, use this command:\n+\n+   ```\n+   drop-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1\n+   ```\n+\n+\n+##### Increase introspection job timeout\n+\n+Because JRF domain home creation takes a considerable amount of time the first time it is created, and because Model in Image creates your domain home for you using the introspection job, you should increase the timeout for the introspection job. Use the `configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds` in `k8s-domain.yaml.template` to override the default with a value of at least 300 seconds (the default is 120 seconds).  \n+\n+##### Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets\n+\n+To allow Model in Image to access the RCU database and OPSS wallet, it's necessary to set up an RCU access secret and an OPSS secret before deploying your domain. It's also necessary to define an `RCUDbInfo` stanza in your model. The sample already sets up all of these for you.  See:\n+\n+| Sample file | Description |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, with `password=welcome1`. |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, with appropriate values for attributes `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string`. |\n+| `model1.yaml.jrf` | Populates the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string` attributes by referencing their locations in the `sample-domain1-rcu-access` secret. The `build.sh` script uses this model instead of `model.yaml.wls` when the source domain type is `JRF`. |\n+| `k8s-domain.yaml.template` | Ensures that the domain mounts the OPSS key secret by setting the domain resource `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` attribute to `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, and ensures the domain mounts the RCU access secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, for reference by WDT model macros by setting the domain resource `configuration.secrets` attribute. |\n+| `k8s-domain.yaml.template` | Set `configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds` to 300; see [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout). |\n+\n+ **NOTE**: This step is for information purposes only. Do not run the above sample files directly. The sample's main build and run scripts will run them for you.\n+\n+##### Reusing or sharing RCU tables\n+\n+Note that when you succesfully deploy your JRF domain resource for the first time, the introspector job will initialize the RCU tables for the domain using the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza in the WDT model plus the `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` specified in the domain resource. The job will also create a new domain home. Finally, the operator will also capture an OPSS wallet file from the new domain's local directory and place this file in a new Kubernetes config map.\n+\n+There are scenarios when the domain needs to be re-created between updates such as WebLogic credentials are changed, security roles defined in the WDT model have been changed or you want to share the same RCU tables with different domains.  Under these scenarios, the operator needs the `walletPasswordSecret` as well as the OPSS wallet file, together with the exact information in `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` so that the domain can be re-created and access the same set of RCU tables.  Without the wallet file and wallet password, you will not be able to re-create a domain accessing the same set of RCU tables, therefore it is highly recommended to backup the wallet file.\n+\n+To recover a domain's RCU tables between domain restarts or to share an RCU schema between different domains, it is necessary to extract this wallet file from the config map and save the OPSS wallet password secret that was used for the original domain. The wallet password and wallet file are needed again when you recreate the domain or share the database with other domains.\n+\n+To save the wallet file:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -s [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>]\n+```\n+\n+You should back up this file to a safe location that can be retrieved later.\n+\n+To reuse the wallet for subsequent redeployments or share the RCU tables between different domains:\n+\n+1. Store the wallet in a secret:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -r [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>] [-ws <name of the secret. Default DOMAIN_UID-opss-walletfile-secret> ]\n+\n+```\n+\n+2. Modify the domain resource YAML file to provide the secret names:\n+\n+```\n+  configuration:\n+    opss:\n+      # Name of secret with walletPassword for extracting the wallet\n+      walletPasswordSecret: sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret      \n+      # Name of secret with walletFile containing base64 encoded opss wallet\n+      walletFileSecret: sample-domain1-opss-walletfile-secret\n+\n+```\n+\n+See [Reusing an RCU database]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/reusing-rcu.md\" >}}) for instructions.\n+\n+### Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image\n+\n+A Model in Image image must contain a WebLogic install, a WebLogic Deploy Tool install, and your WDT model files. You can use the sample `./build.sh` script to build this image, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Uses `docker pull` to obtain a base image which already contains a WebLogic install. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types) to set up access to the base image.)\n+  - Downloads the latest WebLogic Image Tool and WebLogic Deploy Tool to `WORKDIR`.\n+  - Creates and populates a staging directory `$WORKDIR/models` that contains your WDT model files and WDT application archive.\n+    - Builds  a simple servlet application in `$SAMPLEDIR/sample_app` into a WDT model application archive `$WORKDIR/models/archive1.zip`.\n+    - Copies sample model files from `$SAMPLEDIR/model-in-image` to `$WORKDIR/models`. This uses a model file that is appropriate to the domain type (for example, the `JRF` domain model includes database access configuration).\n+  - Uses the WebLogic Image Tool and the `$WORKDIR/models` staging directory to create a final image named `model-in-image:v1` that layers on the base image. Specifically, it runs the WebLogic Image Tool with its `update` option, which:\n+    - Builds the final image as a layer on the base image.\n+    - Puts a WDT install in image location, `/u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy`.\n+    - Copies the WDT model, properties, and application archive from `$WORDKIR/models` to image location, `/u01/wdt/models`.\n+\n+The script expects `JAVA_HOME`, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).)\n+\n+Run the script:\n+\n+  ```\n+  $SAMPLEDIR/build.sh\n+  ```\n+\n+If you intend to use a remote Docker registry, you need to tag and push the image to the remote Docker registry.\n+\n+1.  Tag the image for the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker tag model-in-image:v1 my.remote.registry.com/model-in-image:v1\n+```\n+\n+2.  Push the image to the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker push my.remote.registry.com/model-in-image:v1\n+```\n+\n+3. Create the pull secret for the remote Docker registry:\n+\n+```\n+ kubectl -n <domain namespace> create secret docker-registry <secret name> \\\n+     --docker-server=my.remote.registry.com \\\n+     --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+     --docker-password=your-password \\\n+     --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+\n+```\n+\n+4. Update the domain template file `$SAMPLEDIR/k8s-domain.yaml.template` to provide the `imagePullSecrets`:\n+\n+```\n+  imagePullSecrets:\n+  - name: <secret name>\n+\n+```\n+\n+This domain template file will be used in the next step ([Create and deploy your Kubernetes resources](#create-and-deploy-your-kubernetes-resources)) when it creates your final domain resource file.\n+\n+5. Export the environment variables for the image name and tag using the same values in step 1:\n+\n+```\n+export MODEL_IMAGE_NAME=\"my.remote.registry.com/model-in-image\"\n+export MODEL_IMAGE_TAG=\"v1\"\n+```\n+\n+These environment variables will be used in the next step ([Create and deploy your Kubernetes resources](#create-and-deploy-your-kubernetes-resources)) when it creates your final domain resource file.\n+\n+### Create and deploy your Kubernetes resources\n+\n+To deploy the sample operator domain and its required Kubernetes resources, use the sample script, `$SAMPLEDIR/run_domain.sh`, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Deletes the domain with a `DomainUID` of `domain1` in the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`, if it already exists.\n+  - Creates a secret containing your WebLogic administrator user name and password.\n+  - Creates a secret containing your Model in Image runtime encryption password:\n+    - All model-in-image domains must supply a runtime encryption secret with a `password` value.\n+    - It is used to encrypt configuration that is passed around internally by the Operator.\n+    - The value must be kept private but can be arbitrary: you can optionally supply a different secret value every time you restart the domain.\n+  - Creates secrets containing your RCU access URL, credentials, and prefix (these are unused unless the domain type is `JRF`).\n+  - Creates a config map containing an additional WDT model properties file, `$SAMPLEDIR/model1.20.properties`.\n+  - Generates a domain resource YAML file, `$WORKDIR/k8s-domain.yaml`, using `$SAMPLEDIR/k8s-domain.yaml.template`.\n+  - Deploys `k8s-domain.yaml`.\n+  - Displays the status of the domain pods.\n+\n+The script expects `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE` and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized.

[(8) Prerequisites for JRF domain types.](#8-prerequisites-for-jrf-domain-types)\n+\n+### Requirements\n+\n+Here's what's needed to create and deploy a typical Model in Image domain:\n+\n+#### (1) WebLogic operator.\n+\n+Deploy a WebLogic operator and ensure that it is monitoring the desired namespace for your Model in Image domain. See [Manage operators]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-operators/_index.md\" >}}) and [Quick Start]({{< relref \"/quickstart/_index.md\" >}}).\n+\n+#### (2) WebLogic image.\n+\n+Model in Image requires creating a 'final' deployable image that has WebLogic Server and WDT installed, plus your model and application files. \n+\n+You can start with a WebLogic 12.2.1.3 or later pre-built base image obtained from [Docker Hub](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/master/OracleWebLogic) or similar, manually build your own base image as per [Preparing a Base Image]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-in-image/base-images/_index.md\" >}}), or build a base image using the WebLogic Image Tool [WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool). Note that any 12.2.1.3 image must also include patch 29135930 (the pre-built images already contain this patch). For an example of the first approach for both WLS and JRF domains, see the [Model in Image Sample]({{< relref \"/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}).\n+\n+Once you have a base image, Model in Image requires layering the following directory structure for its (optional) WDT models artifacts and (required) WDT binaries:\n+\n+| Directory                | Contents                           | Extension   |\n+| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------- |\n+| /u01/wdt/models          | optional domain model yaml files   | .yaml       |\n+| /u01/wdt/models          | optional model variable files      | .properties |\n+| /u01/wdt/models          | optional application archives      | .zip        |\n+| /u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy | unzipped weblogic deploy install   |             |\n+\n+There are two methods for layering a Model in Image artifacts on top of a base image:\n+\n+  - __Method 1: Manual Image Creation__: Use docker commands to layer the WDT artifacts from the above table on top of your base image into a new image.\n+\n+  - __Method 2: WebLogic Image Tool__: Use the convenient [WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool). The WebLogic Image Tool (WIT) has built-in options for embedding WDT model files, WDT binaries, WebLogic binaries install, and WebLogic patches in an image. The [Model in Image sample]({{< relref \"/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) takes the WIT approach, see the sample's `build_image_model.sh` in the operator source's `kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image` directory for an example.\n+\n+See [Model files]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md\" >}}) for a discussion of model file syntax.\n+\n+#### (3) Optional WDT model config map.\n+\n+You can create a WDT model config map that defines additional model `.yaml` and `.properties` files beyond what you've already supplied in your image, and then reference this config map using your domain resource's `configuration.model.configMap` attribute. This is optional if the supplied image already fully defines your model. \n+\n+WDT model config map files will be merged with the WDT files defined in your image at runtime before your domain home is created. The config map files can add to, remove from, or alter the model configuration that you supplied within your image.\n+\n+For example, place additional `.yaml` and `.properties` files in a directory called `/home/acmeuser/wdtoverride` and run the following commands:\n+\n+  ```\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    create configmap MY-DOMAINUID-my-wdt-config-map \\\n+    --from-file /home/acmeuser/wdtoverride\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    label  configmap MY-DOMAINUID-my-wdt-config-map \\\n+    weblogic.domainUID=MY-DOMAINUID\n+  ```\n+\n+See [Model files]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md\" >}}) for a discussion of model file syntax and loading order, and see [Runtime updates]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/runtime-updates.md\" >}}) for a discussion of using WDT model config maps to update the model configuration of a running domain.\n+\n+\n+#### (4) Optional WDT encryption secret.\n+\n+> NOTE: Oracle strongly recommends storing sensitive information using Kubernetes secrets when practical instead of relying on this option. See [(6) Secrets for model macros.](#6-secrets-for-model-macros).\n+\n+The WDT encryption option is an alternative to using secrets for encrypting sensitive information stored in a model. The WDT encryption option requires:\n+ - Using WDT tooling to encrypt your model files prior to putting them in a Model in Image image or a Model in Image WDT config map.\n+ - Supplying a WDT encryption `password` via a Kubernetes secret so that Model in Image can decrypt the model at runtime. The secret can be named anything, but it must contain a key named `password`. Example WDT encryption secret creation:\n+   ```\n+   kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+     create secret generic MY-DOMAINUID-wdt-encrypt-secret \\\n+     --from-literal=password=welcome1\n+   kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+     label secret MY-DOMAINUID-wdt-encrypt-secret \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=MY-DOMAINUID\n+   ```\n+ - Setting the domain resource `config.model.wdtEncryptionSecret` field to the name of the secret.\n+\n+For more information see the [WDT Deploy Tool Encrypt Documentation](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling/blob/master/site/encrypt.md).\n+\n+#### (5) Required runtime encryption secret.\n+\n+Model in Image requires a runtime encryption secret with a secure `password` key. This secret is used by the Operator to encrypt model and domain home artifacts before it adds them to a runtime config map or log. The `password` that you set can safely change any time after you've fully shutdown a domain but must remain the same for the life of a running domain. The runtime encryption secret that you create can be named anything but note that it is a best practice to name and label secrets with their domain UID to help ensure that cleanup scripts can find and delete them.\n+\n+> NOTE: Because the runtime encryption password does not need to be shared and only needs to exist for the life of a domain, you may want to use a password generator.\n+\n+Example:\n+\n+  ```\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    create secret generic MY-DOMAINUID-runtime-encrypt-secret \\\n+    --from-literal=password=welcome1\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    label secret MY-DOMAINUID-runtime-encrypt-secret \\\n+    weblogic.domainUID=MY-DOMAINUID\n+  ```\n+\n+Corresponding domain resource snippet:\n+\n+  ```\n+  configuration:\n+    model:\n+      runtimeEncryptionSecret: MY-DOMAINUID-runtime-encrypt-secret\n+  ```\n+\n+#### (6) Secrets for model macros.\n+\n+Create additional secrets as needed by macros in your model files. For example, these can store database URLs and credentials that are accessed via `@@FILE` macros in your model that reference the secrets.  See [Model files]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md\" >}}) for a discusion of model macros.\n+\n+#### (7) Domain resource attributes.\n+\n+The following domain resource attributes are specific to Model in Image domains.\n+\n+| Domain Resource Attribute                    |  Notes |\n+| -------------------------                    |  ------------------ |\n+| `domainHomeSourceType`                       |  Required. Set to `FromModel` |\n+| `domainHome`                                 |  Must reference an empty or non-existent directory within your image. Do not include the mount the path of any persistent volume. Note that Model in Image recreates the domain home for a WebLogic pod every time the pod restarts.|\n+| `configuration.model.wdtConfigMap`           | Optional. Set if you have stored additional models in a config map as per [(3) Optional WDT model config map.](#3-optional-wdt-model-config-map). |\n+| `configuration.model.secrets`                | Optional. Set this array if your image or config map models contain macros that reference custom Kubernetes secrets. For example, if your macros depend on secrets `my-secret` and `my-other-secret` then set to `[my-secret, my-other-secret]`.|\n+| `configuration.model.RuntimeEncryptionSecret`| Required. All Model in Image domain's must specify a runtime encryption secret. See [(5) Required runtime encryption secret.](#5-required-runtime-encryption-secret). |\n+| `configuration.model.wdtEncryptionSecret`    | Rarely used. Set if your using wdt model encryption as per [(4) Optional WDT encryption secret.](#4-optional-wdt-encryption-secret).|\n+| `configuration.model.domainType`             | Set the type of domain. Valid values are `WLS`, `JRF`, and `RestrictedJRF` where `WLS` is the default. See [WDT Domain Types](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling/blob/master/site/type_def.md).|\n+\n+Notes:\n+\n+ - There are additional attributes that are common to all domain home source types, such as the `image` field, etc. See the Domain Resource [Schema](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/blob/master/docs/domains/Domain.md) and [Doc]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-resource.md\" >}}) for a full list of domain resource fields.\n+\n+ - There are also additional fields that are specific to JRF domain types. See [(8) Prerequisites for JRF domain types.](#8-prerequisites-for-jrf-domain-types) below for more information.\n+\n+ - __Sample domain resource__: For an example of a fully specified sample domain resource, see the the operator source's `kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image/k8s-domain.yaml.template` file for the [Model in Image sample]({{< relref \"/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}). Note that the '@@' entries in this template are not processed by the Operator -- they need to replaced with actual values before the resource can be applied. \n+\n+#### (8) Prerequisites for JRF domain types.\n+\n+> __IMPORTANT__: This section only applies for a `JRF` domain type. Skip it if your domain type is simply a `WLS` or a `RestrictedJRF` domain.\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database called an RCU Database, requires initializing this database, and requires configuring your domain to access this database.

See [Manage operators]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-operators/_index.md\" >}}) and [Quick Start]({{< relref \"/quickstart/_index.md\" >}}).\n+\n+#### (2) WebLogic image.\n+\n+Model in Image requires creating a 'final' deployable image that has WebLogic Server and WDT installed, plus your model and application files. \n+\n+You can start with a WebLogic 12.2.1.3 or later pre-built base image obtained from [Docker Hub](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/master/OracleWebLogic) or similar, manually build your own base image as per [Preparing a Base Image]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-in-image/base-images/_index.md\" >}}), or build a base image using the WebLogic Image Tool [WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool). Note that any 12.2.1.3 image must also include patch 29135930 (the pre-built images already contain this patch). For an example of the first approach for both WLS and JRF domains, see the [Model in Image Sample]({{< relref \"/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}).\n+\n+Once you have a base image, Model in Image requires layering the following directory structure for its (optional) WDT models artifacts and (required) WDT binaries:\n+\n+| Directory                | Contents                           | Extension   |\n+| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------- |\n+| /u01/wdt/models          | optional domain model yaml files   | .yaml       |\n+| /u01/wdt/models          | optional model variable files      | .properties |\n+| /u01/wdt/models          | optional application archives      | .zip        |\n+| /u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy | unzipped weblogic deploy install   |             |\n+\n+There are two methods for layering a Model in Image artifacts on top of a base image:\n+\n+  - __Method 1: Manual Image Creation__: Use docker commands to layer the WDT artifacts from the above table on top of your base image into a new image.\n+\n+  - __Method 2: WebLogic Image Tool__: Use the convenient [WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool). The WebLogic Image Tool (WIT) has built-in options for embedding WDT model files, WDT binaries, WebLogic binaries install, and WebLogic patches in an image. The [Model in Image sample]({{< relref \"/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) takes the WIT approach, see the sample's `build_image_model.sh` in the operator source's `kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image` directory for an example.\n+\n+See [Model files]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md\" >}}) for a discussion of model file syntax.\n+\n+#### (3) Optional WDT model config map.\n+\n+You can create a WDT model config map that defines additional model `.yaml` and `.properties` files beyond what you've already supplied in your image, and then reference this config map using your domain resource's `configuration.model.configMap` attribute. This is optional if the supplied image already fully defines your model. \n+\n+WDT model config map files will be merged with the WDT files defined in your image at runtime before your domain home is created. The config map files can add to, remove from, or alter the model configuration that you supplied within your image.\n+\n+For example, place additional `.yaml` and `.properties` files in a directory called `/home/acmeuser/wdtoverride` and run the following commands:\n+\n+  ```\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    create configmap MY-DOMAINUID-my-wdt-config-map \\\n+    --from-file /home/acmeuser/wdtoverride\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    label  configmap MY-DOMAINUID-my-wdt-config-map \\\n+    weblogic.domainUID=MY-DOMAINUID\n+  ```\n+\n+See [Model files]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md\" >}}) for a discussion of model file syntax and loading order, and see [Runtime updates]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/runtime-updates.md\" >}}) for a discussion of using WDT model config maps to update the model configuration of a running domain.\n+\n+\n+#### (4) Optional WDT encryption secret.\n+\n+> NOTE: Oracle strongly recommends storing sensitive information using Kubernetes secrets when practical instead of relying on this option. See [(6) Secrets for model macros.](#6-secrets-for-model-macros).\n+\n+The WDT encryption option is an alternative to using secrets for encrypting sensitive information stored in a model. The WDT encryption option requires:\n+ - Using WDT tooling to encrypt your model files prior to putting them in a Model in Image image or a Model in Image WDT config map.\n+ - Supplying a WDT encryption `password` via a Kubernetes secret so that Model in Image can decrypt the model at runtime. The secret can be named anything, but it must contain a key named `password`. Example WDT encryption secret creation:\n+   ```\n+   kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+     create secret generic MY-DOMAINUID-wdt-encrypt-secret \\\n+     --from-literal=password=welcome1\n+   kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+     label secret MY-DOMAINUID-wdt-encrypt-secret \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=MY-DOMAINUID\n+   ```\n+ - Setting the domain resource `config.model.wdtEncryptionSecret` field to the name of the secret.\n+\n+For more information see the [WDT Deploy Tool Encrypt Documentation](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling/blob/master/site/encrypt.md).\n+\n+#### (5) Required runtime encryption secret.\n+\n+Model in Image requires a runtime encryption secret with a secure `password` key. This secret is used by the Operator to encrypt model and domain home artifacts before it adds them to a runtime config map or log. The `password` that you set can safely change any time after you've fully shutdown a domain but must remain the same for the life of a running domain. The runtime encryption secret that you create can be named anything but note that it is a best practice to name and label secrets with their domain UID to help ensure that cleanup scripts can find and delete them.\n+\n+> NOTE: Because the runtime encryption password does not need to be shared and only needs to exist for the life of a domain, you may want to use a password generator.\n+\n+Example:\n+\n+  ```\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    create secret generic MY-DOMAINUID-runtime-encrypt-secret \\\n+    --from-literal=password=welcome1\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    label secret MY-DOMAINUID-runtime-encrypt-secret \\\n+    weblogic.domainUID=MY-DOMAINUID\n+  ```\n+\n+Corresponding domain resource snippet:\n+\n+  ```\n+  configuration:\n+    model:\n+      runtimeEncryptionSecret: MY-DOMAINUID-runtime-encrypt-secret\n+  ```\n+\n+#### (6) Secrets for model macros.\n+\n+Create additional secrets as needed by macros in your model files. For example, these can store database URLs and credentials that are accessed via `@@FILE` macros in your model that reference the secrets.  See [Model files]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md\" >}}) for a discusion of model macros.\n+\n+#### (7) Domain resource attributes.\n+\n+The following domain resource attributes are specific to Model in Image domains.\n+\n+| Domain Resource Attribute                    |  Notes |\n+| -------------------------                    |  ------------------ |\n+| `domainHomeSourceType`                       |  Required.

See [Manage operators]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-operators/_index.md\" >}}) and [Quick Start]({{< relref \"/quickstart/_index.md\" >}}).\n+\n+#### (2) WebLogic image.\n+\n+Model in Image requires creating a 'final' deployable image that has WebLogic Server and WDT installed, plus your model and application files. \n+\n+You can start with a WebLogic 12.2.1.3 or later pre-built base image obtained from [Docker Hub](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/master/OracleWebLogic) or similar, manually build your own base image as per [Preparing a Base Image]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-in-image/base-images/_index.md\" >}}), or build a base image using the WebLogic Image Tool [WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool). Note that any 12.2.1.3 image must also include patch 29135930 (the pre-built images already contain this patch). For an example of the first approach for both WLS and JRF domains, see the [Model in Image Sample]({{< relref \"/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}).\n+\n+Once you have a base image, Model in Image requires layering the following directory structure for its (optional) WDT models artifacts and (required) WDT binaries:\n+\n+| Directory                | Contents                           | Extension   |\n+| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------- |\n+| /u01/wdt/models          | optional domain model yaml files   | .yaml       |\n+| /u01/wdt/models          | optional model variable files      | .properties |\n+| /u01/wdt/models          | optional application archives      | .zip        |\n+| /u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy | unzipped weblogic deploy install   |             |\n+\n+There are two methods for layering a Model in Image artifacts on top of a base image:\n+\n+  - __Method 1: Manual Image Creation__: Use docker commands to layer the WDT artifacts from the above table on top of your base image into a new image.\n+\n+  - __Method 2: WebLogic Image Tool__: Use the convenient [WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool). The WebLogic Image Tool (WIT) has built-in options for embedding WDT model files, WDT binaries, WebLogic binaries install, and WebLogic patches in an image. The [Model in Image sample]({{< relref \"/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) takes the WIT approach, see the sample's `build_image_model.sh` in the operator source's `kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image` directory for an example.\n+\n+See [Model files]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md\" >}}) for a discussion of model file syntax.\n+\n+#### (3) Optional WDT model config map.\n+\n+You can create a WDT model config map that defines additional model `.yaml` and `.properties` files beyond what you've already supplied in your image, and then reference this config map using your domain resource's `configuration.model.configMap` attribute. This is optional if the supplied image already fully defines your model. \n+\n+WDT model config map files will be merged with the WDT files defined in your image at runtime before your domain home is created. The config map files can add to, remove from, or alter the model configuration that you supplied within your image.\n+\n+For example, place additional `.yaml` and `.properties` files in a directory called `/home/acmeuser/wdtoverride` and run the following commands:\n+\n+  ```\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    create configmap MY-DOMAINUID-my-wdt-config-map \\\n+    --from-file /home/acmeuser/wdtoverride\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    label  configmap MY-DOMAINUID-my-wdt-config-map \\\n+    weblogic.domainUID=MY-DOMAINUID\n+  ```\n+\n+See [Model files]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md\" >}}) for a discussion of model file syntax and loading order, and see [Runtime updates]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/runtime-updates.md\" >}}) for a discussion of using WDT model config maps to update the model configuration of a running domain.\n+\n+\n+#### (4) Optional WDT encryption secret.\n+\n+> NOTE: Oracle strongly recommends storing sensitive information using Kubernetes secrets when practical instead of relying on this option. See [(6) Secrets for model macros.](#6-secrets-for-model-macros).\n+\n+The WDT encryption option is an alternative to using secrets for encrypting sensitive information stored in a model. The WDT encryption option requires:\n+ - Using WDT tooling to encrypt your model files prior to putting them in a Model in Image image or a Model in Image WDT config map.\n+ - Supplying a WDT encryption `password` via a Kubernetes secret so that Model in Image can decrypt the model at runtime. The secret can be named anything, but it must contain a key named `password`. Example WDT encryption secret creation:\n+   ```\n+   kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+     create secret generic MY-DOMAINUID-wdt-encrypt-secret \\\n+     --from-literal=password=welcome1\n+   kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+     label secret MY-DOMAINUID-wdt-encrypt-secret \\\n+     weblogic.domainUID=MY-DOMAINUID\n+   ```\n+ - Setting the domain resource `config.model.wdtEncryptionSecret` field to the name of the secret.\n+\n+For more information see the [WDT Deploy Tool Encrypt Documentation](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling/blob/master/site/encrypt.md).\n+\n+#### (5) Required runtime encryption secret.\n+\n+Model in Image requires a runtime encryption secret with a secure `password` key. This secret is used by the Operator to encrypt model and domain home artifacts before it adds them to a runtime config map or log. The `password` that you set can safely change any time after you've fully shutdown a domain but must remain the same for the life of a running domain. The runtime encryption secret that you create can be named anything but note that it is a best practice to name and label secrets with their domain UID to help ensure that cleanup scripts can find and delete them.\n+\n+> NOTE: Because the runtime encryption password does not need to be shared and only needs to exist for the life of a domain, you may want to use a password generator.\n+\n+Example:\n+\n+  ```\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    create secret generic MY-DOMAINUID-runtime-encrypt-secret \\\n+    --from-literal=password=welcome1\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    label secret MY-DOMAINUID-runtime-encrypt-secret \\\n+    weblogic.domainUID=MY-DOMAINUID\n+  ```\n+\n+Corresponding domain resource snippet:\n+\n+  ```\n+  configuration:\n+    model:\n+      runtimeEncryptionSecret: MY-DOMAINUID-runtime-encrypt-secret\n+  ```\n+\n+#### (6) Secrets for model macros.\n+\n+Create additional secrets as needed by macros in your model files. For example, these can store database URLs and credentials that are accessed via `@@FILE` macros in your model that reference the secrets.  See [Model files]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md\" >}}) for a discusion of model macros.\n+\n+#### (7) Domain resource attributes.\n+\n+The following domain resource attributes are specific to Model in Image domains.\n+\n+| Domain Resource Attribute                    |  Notes |\n+| -------------------------                    |  ------------------ |\n+| `domainHomeSourceType`                       |  Required. Set to `FromModel` |\n+| `domainHome`                                 |  Must reference an empty or non-existent directory within your image. Do not include the mount the path of any persistent volume. Note that Model in Image recreates the domain home for a WebLogic pod every time the pod restarts.|\n+| `configuration.model.wdtConfigMap`           | Optional. Set if you have stored additional models in a config map as per [(3) Optional WDT model config map.](#3-optional-wdt-model-config-map). |\n+| `configuration.model.secrets`                | Optional. Set this array if your image or config map models contain macros that reference custom Kubernetes secrets. For example, if your macros depend on secrets `my-secret` and `my-other-secret` then set to `[my-secret, my-other-secret]`.|\n+| `configuration.model.RuntimeEncryptionSecret`| Required. All Model in Image domain's must specify a runtime encryption secret. See [(5) Required runtime encryption secret.](#5-required-runtime-encryption-secret). |\n+| `configuration.model.wdtEncryptionSecret`    | Rarely used. Set if your using wdt model encryption as per [(4) Optional WDT encryption secret.](#4-optional-wdt-encryption-secret).|\n+| `configuration.model.domainType`             | Set the type of domain. Valid values are `WLS`, `JRF`, and `RestrictedJRF` where `WLS` is the default. See [WDT Domain Types](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling/blob/master/site/type_def.md).|\n+\n+Notes:\n+\n+ - There are additional attributes that are common to all domain home source types, such as the `image` field, etc. See the Domain Resource [Schema](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/blob/master/docs/domains/Domain.md) and [Doc]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-resource.md\" >}}) for a full list of domain resource fields.\n+\n+ - There are also additional fields that are specific to JRF domain types. See [(8) Prerequisites for JRF domain types.](#8-prerequisites-for-jrf-domain-types) below for more information.\n+\n+ - __Sample domain resource__: For an example of a fully specified sample domain resource, see the the operator source's `kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image/k8s-domain.yaml.template` file for the [Model in Image sample]({{< relref \"/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}). Note that the '@@' entries in this template are not processed by the Operator -- they need to replaced with actual values before the resource can be applied. \n+\n+#### (8) Prerequisites for JRF domain types.\n+\n+> __IMPORTANT__: This section only applies for a `JRF` domain type. Skip it if your domain type is simply a `WLS` or a `RestrictedJRF` domain.\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database called an RCU Database, requires initializing this database, and requires configuring your domain to access this database. All of these steps must occur before you first deploy your domain. When you first deploy your domain, the introspector job will initialize it's RCU schema tables in the database - a process that can take several minutes.\n+\n+Furthermore, if you want to have a restarted JRF domain access updates to the infrastructure database that the domain made at an earlier time, the restarted domain must be supplied a wallet file that was obtained from a previous run of the domain as discussed in [Reusing an RCU database]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/reusing-rcu.md\" >}}). \n+\n+Assuming you have an RCU database that's running and initialized, here are the specific Model in Image requirements:\n+\n+- Set `configuration.model.domainType` to `JRF`.\n+\n+- Set `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` to reference a secret that defines a `walletPassword` key. This is used to encrypt the domain's OPSS wallet file.\n+\n+- Set `configuration.opss.walletFileSecret` to reference a secret that contains your domain's OPSS wallet file in its `walletFile` key. This assumes you have an OPSS wallet file from a previous start of the same domain. It enables a restarted or migrated domain to access its RCU database information. For more information, see [Reusing an RCU database between domain deployments](#reusing-an-rcu-database-between-domain-deployments).\n+\n+- Set `configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds` introspection job timeout to at least 300. This is needed because domain home creation takes a considerable amount of time the first time a JRF domain is created (due to initializing the domain's RCU database tables), and because Model in Image creates your domain home for you using the introspection job. \n+\n+- Define an `RCUDbInfo` stanza in your model. Access to an RCU database requires defining a `RCUDbInfo` stanza in your model's `domainInfo` stanza with the necessary information for accessing the domain's schema within the database. Usually this information should be supplied via a secret that you deploy and reference in your domain resource's 'configuration.secrets' field. Here's an example `RCUDbInfo` stanza:\n+\n+  ```\n+  domainInfo:\n+      RCUDbInfo:\n+          rcu_prefix: '@@FILE:/weblogic-operator/config-overrides-secrets/sample-domain1-rcu-access/rcu_prefix@@'\n+          rcu_schema_password: '@@FILE:/weblogic-operator/config-overrides-secrets/sample-domain1-rcu-access/rcu_schema_password@@'\n+          rcu_admin_password: '@@FILE:/weblogic-operator/config-overrides-secrets/sample-domain1-rcu-access/rcu_admin_password@@'", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "4a653acd9b75e15444ff7896b720d52427bd35ed"}, "originalPosition": 167}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5NjU3NzY4Ng==", "bodyText": "It's gone.", "url": "https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/pull/1478#discussion_r396577686", "createdAt": "2020-03-23T16:19:35Z", "author": {"login": "tbarnes-us"}, "path": "docs-source/content/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/usage.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,176 @@\n++++\n+title = \"Usage\"\n+date = 2020-03-11T16:45:16-05:00\n+weight = 20\n+pre = \"<b> </b>\"\n+description = \"Steps for creating and deploying Model in Image images and their associated domain resourcess.\"\n++++\n+\n+\n+### Contents\n+\n+   - [(1) WebLogic operator.](#1-weblogic-operator)\n+   - [(2) WebLogic image.](#2-weblogic-image)\n+   - [(3) Optional WDT model config map.](#3-optional-wdt-model-config-map)\n+   - [(4) Optional WDT encryption secret.](#4-optional-wdt-encryption-secret)\n+   - [(5) Required runtime encryption secret.](#5-required-runtime-encryption-secret)\n+   - [(6) Secrets for model macros.](#6-secrets-for-model-macros)\n+   - [(7) Domain resource attributes.](#7-domain-resource-attributes)\n+   - [(8) Prerequisites for JRF domain types.](#8-prerequisites-for-jrf-domain-types)\n+\n+### Requirements\n+\n+Here's what's needed to create and deploy a typical Model in Image domain:\n+\n+#### (1) WebLogic operator.\n+\n+Deploy a WebLogic operator and ensure that it is monitoring the desired namespace for your Model in Image domain.

See [(8) Prerequisites for JRF domain types.](#8-prerequisites-for-jrf-domain-types) below for more information.\n+\n+ - __Sample domain resource__: For an example of a fully specified sample domain resource, see the the operator source's `kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image/k8s-domain.yaml.template` file for the [Model in Image sample]({{< relref \"/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}). Note that the '@@' entries in this template are not processed by the Operator -- they need to replaced with actual values before the resource can be applied. \n+\n+#### (8) Prerequisites for JRF domain types.\n+\n+> __IMPORTANT__: This section only applies for a `JRF` domain type. Skip it if your domain type is simply a `WLS` or a `RestrictedJRF` domain.\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database called an RCU Database, requires initializing this database, and requires configuring your domain to access this database. All of these steps must occur before you first deploy your domain. When you first deploy your domain, the introspector job will initialize it's RCU schema tables in the database - a process that can take several minutes.\n+\n+Furthermore, if you want to have a restarted JRF domain access updates to the infrastructure database that the domain made at an earlier time, the restarted domain must be supplied a wallet file that was obtained from a previous run of the domain as discussed in [Reusing an RCU database]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/reusing-rcu.md\" >}}). \n+\n+Assuming you have an RCU database that's running and initialized, here are the specific Model in Image requirements:\n+\n+- Set `configuration.model.domainType` to `JRF`.\n+\n+- Set `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` to reference a secret that defines a `walletPassword` key. This is used to encrypt the domain's OPSS wallet file.\n+\n+- Set `configuration.opss.walletFileSecret` to reference a secret that contains your domain's OPSS wallet file in its `walletFile` key. This assumes you have an OPSS wallet file from a previous start of the same domain. It enables a restarted or migrated domain to access its RCU database information. For more information, see [Reusing an RCU database between domain deployments](#reusing-an-rcu-database-between-domain-deployments).\n+\n+- Set `configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds` introspection job timeout to at least 300. This is needed because domain home creation takes a considerable amount of time the first time a JRF domain is created (due to initializing the domain's RCU database tables), and because Model in Image creates your domain home for you using the introspection job. \n+\n+- Define an `RCUDbInfo` stanza in your model. Access to an RCU database requires defining a `RCUDbInfo` stanza in your model's `domainInfo` stanza with the necessary information for accessing the domain's schema within the database. Usually this information should be supplied via a secret that you deploy and reference in your domain resource's 'configuration.secrets' field. Here's an example `RCUDbInfo` stanza:\n+\n+  ```\n+  domainInfo:\n+      RCUDbInfo:\n+          rcu_prefix: '@@FILE:/weblogic-operator/config-overrides-secrets/sample-domain1-rcu-access/rcu_prefix@@'\n+          rcu_schema_password: '@@FILE:/weblogic-operator/config-overrides-secrets/sample-domain1-rcu-access/rcu_schema_password@@'\n+          rcu_admin_password: '@@FILE:/weblogic-operator/config-overrides-secrets/sample-domain1-rcu-access/rcu_admin_password@@'", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5NTczMTg4Mg=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "4a653acd9b75e15444ff7896b720d52427bd35ed"}, "originalPosition": 167}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMjQ1MzU3NjE1OnYy", "diffSide": "LEFT", "path": "operator/src/main/java/oracle/kubernetes/weblogic/domain/model/DomainSpec.java", "isResolved": true, "comments": {"totalCount": 3, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMy0yMFQxOTozMjozNFrOF5gxsw==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMy0yM1QyMDo0NDo1N1rOF6XaKg==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5NTg1MDE2Mw==", "bodyText": "In the old code, if logHomeEnabled is not set, and the domain is on PV, the logHomeEnabled will be set to true.

Similarly, `RestrictedJRF` domains may be used by Oracle layered products such as Oracle Communications products.\n+\n+### References\n+\n+To reference the relevant user documentation, see:\n+ - [Model in Image User Guide]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) user documentation\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Server Deploy Tooling](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling)\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool)\n+\n+\n+\n+### Prerequisites for all domain types\n+\n+1. The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable must be set and must reference a valid JDK8 installation. (`JAVA_HOME` is used by the WebLogic Image Tool.)\n+\n+2. Set a source directory environment variable `SRCDIR` that references the parent of the operator source tree. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   mkdir ~/wlopsrc\n+   cd ~/wlopsrc\n+   git clone https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator.git\n+   export SRCDIR=$(pwd)/weblogic-kubernetes-operator\n+   ```\n+\n+   For additional information about obtaining the operator source, see the [Developer Guide Requirements](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/developerguide/requirements/).\n+\n+3. Create a sample directory environment variable `SAMPLEDIR` that references this sample's directory:\n+\n+   ```\n+   export SAMPLEDIR=${SRCDIR}/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image/\n+   ```\n+\n+4. Create an empty, temporary working directory with 10g of space, and store its location in the `WORKDIR` environment variable. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd <location of empty temporary directory with 10g of space>\n+   export WORKDIR=$(pwd)\n+   ```\n+\n+5. Deploy the operator and set up the operator to manage the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`. Optionally, deploy a Traefik load balancer that manages the same namespace. For example, follow the same steps as the [Quick Start](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/quickstart/), up through the [Prepare for a domain]({{< relref \"/quickstart/prepare.md\" >}}) step.\n+\n+   Note that:\n+   - Deploying the Traefik load balancer is optional, but is a prerequisite for testing the web application that's deployed to WebLogic as part of this sample.\n+   - You can skip the Quick Start steps for obtaining a WebLogic image because you will be creating your own Docker image.\n+\n+\n+6. Choose the type of domain you're going to create: `WLS`, `JRF`, or `RestrictedJRF`, and set the environment variable, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, accordingly. The default is `WLS`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   export WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE=<one of WLS, JRF, or RestrictedJRF>\n+   ```\n+\n+7. Set up access to a base image for this sample that will be used as the base image for creating the final image. Do one of the following:\n+\n+   - __Option 1, download an existing WebLogic image.__\n+\n+     Set up access to this sample's base WebLogic image at the [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com):\n+\n+     a.

If you are using a `JRF` domain type, then it requires an RCU infrastructure database. See [Prerequisites for JRF Domains](#prerequisites-for-jrf-domains). You can do this step before or after you create your final image. If you're not using a `JRF` domain type, proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image).\n+\n+### Prerequisites for JRF domains\n+\n+> __NOTE__: This section is only required for demonstrating a `JRF` domain type. Skip this section and proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image) if your domain type is `WLS` or `RestrictedJRF`.\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database called an RCU database, requires initializing this database, and requires configuring your domain to access this database. All of these steps must occur before you first deploy your domain.\n+\n+Furthermore, if you want to have a restarted JRF domain access updates to the infrastructure database that the domain made at an earlier time, the restarted domain must be supplied a wallet file that was obtained from a previous run of the domain.\n+\n+The following steps demonstrate how to set up an infrastructure database that will work with this sample:\n+\n+  1. [Set up and initialize an RCU database](#set-up-and-initialize-an-rcu-database).\n+  2. [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout).\n+  3. [Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets](#set-up-rcu-model-attributes-domain-resource-attributes-and-secrets).\n+  4. [Reusing or sharing RCU tables](#reusing-or-sharing-rcu-tables).\n+\n+\n+\n+##### Set up and initialize an RCU database\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database and also requires initializing this database with a schema and a set of tables. The following example shows how to set up a sample RCU database and use the RCU tool to create the infrastructure schema for a JRF domain. The RCU database is set up with the following attributes:\n+\n+| Attribute | Value |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| database Kubernetes namespace | `default` |\n+| database Kubernetes pod | `oracle-db` |\n+| database image | `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` |\n+| database password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| infrastructure schema prefix | `FMW1` |\n+| infrastructure schema password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| database URL | `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s` |\n+\n+\n+1. Ensure you have access to the database image, and then deploy it:\n+\n+   - Use a browser to log in to `https://container-registry.oracle.com`, select `database->enterprise` and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+   - Get the database image:\n+     - In the local shell, `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+     - In the local shell, `docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim`.\n+\n+\n+       {{% notice note %}} If a local Docker login and manual pull of `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` is not sufficient (for example, if you are using a remote Kubernetes cluster), then uncomment the `imagePullSecrets` stanza in `$WORKDIR/k8s-db-slim.yaml` and create the image pull secret as follows:\n+\n+              ```\n+              kubectl create secret docker-registry regsecret \\\n+                --docker-server=container-registry.oracle.com \\\n+                --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+                --docker-password=your-password \\\n+                --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+              ```\n+       {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+\n+   - Use the sample script in `$SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service` to create an Oracle database running in the pod, `oracle-db`.\n+\n+      **NOTE**: If your database image access requires the `regsecret` image pull secret that you optionally created above, then pass `-s regsecret` to the `start-db-service.sh` command line.\n+\n+     ```\n+     cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service\n+     start-db-service.sh\n+     ```\n+\n+     This script will deploy a database with the URL, `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`, and administration password, `Oradoc_db1`.\n+\n+     {{% notice warning %}} The Oracle database Docker images are supported only for non-production use. For more details, see My Oracle Support note: Oracle Support for Database Running on Docker (Doc ID 2216342.1) : All the data is gone when the database is restarted.\n+     {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+     **NOTE**: This step is based on the steps documented in [Run a Database](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/userguide/overview/database/).\n+\n+2. Use the sample script in `SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema` to create the RCU schema with the schema prefix `FMW1`.\n+\n+   Note that this script assumes `Oradoc_db1` is the DBA password, `Oradoc_db1` is the schema password, and that the database URL is `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema\n+   ./create-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1 -i container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4\n+   ```\n+\n+   __NOTE__:  If you need to drop the repository, use this command:\n+\n+   ```\n+   drop-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1\n+   ```\n+\n+\n+##### Increase introspection job timeout\n+\n+Because JRF domain home creation takes a considerable amount of time the first time it is created, and because Model in Image creates your domain home for you using the introspection job, you should increase the timeout for the introspection job. Use the `configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds` in `k8s-domain.yaml.template` to override the default with a value of at least 300 seconds (the default is 120 seconds).  \n+\n+##### Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets\n+\n+To allow Model in Image to access the RCU database and OPSS wallet, it's necessary to set up an RCU access secret and an OPSS secret before deploying your domain. It's also necessary to define an `RCUDbInfo` stanza in your model. The sample already sets up all of these for you.  See:\n+\n+| Sample file | Description |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, with `password=welcome1`. |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, with appropriate values for attributes `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string`. |\n+| `model1.yaml.jrf` | Populates the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string` attributes by referencing their locations in the `sample-domain1-rcu-access` secret. The `build.sh` script uses this model instead of `model.yaml.wls` when the source domain type is `JRF`. |\n+| `k8s-domain.yaml.template` | Ensures that the domain mounts the OPSS key secret by setting the domain resource `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` attribute to `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, and ensures the domain mounts the RCU access secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, for reference by WDT model macros by setting the domain resource `configuration.secrets` attribute. Use configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds to increase the timeout value of the introspector job; see [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout). |\n+\n+ **NOTE**: This step is for information purposes only. Do not run the above sample files directly. The sample's main build and run scripts will run them for you.\n+\n+##### Reusing or sharing RCU tables\n+\n+Note that when you succesfully deploy your JRF domain resource for the first time, the introspector job will initialize the RCU tables for the domain using the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza in the WDT model plus the `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` specified in the domain resource. The job will also create a new domain home. Finally, the operator will also capture an OPSS wallet file from the new domain's local directory and place this file in a new Kubernetes config map.\n+\n+There are scenarios when the domain needs to be re-created between updates such as WebLogic credentials are changed, security roles defined in the WDT model have been changed or you want to share the same RCU tables with different domains.  Under these scenarios, the operator needs the `walletPasswordSecret` as well as the OPSS wallet file, together with the exact information in `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` so that the domain can be re-created and access the same set of RCU tables.  Without the wallet file and wallet password, you will not be able to re-create a domain accessing the same set of RCU tables, therefore it is highly recommended to backup the wallet file.\n+\n+To recover a domain's RCU tables between domain restarts or to share an RCU schema between different domains, it is necessary to extract this wallet file from the config map and save the OPSS wallet password secret that was used for the original domain. The wallet password and wallet file are needed again when you recreate the domain or share the database with other domains.\n+\n+To save the wallet file:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -s [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>]\n+```\n+\n+You should back up this file to a safe location that can be retrieved later.\n+\n+To reuse the wallet for subsequent redeployments or share the RCU tables between different domains:\n+\n+1. Store the wallet in a secret:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -r [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>] [-ws <name of the secret. Default DOMAIN_UID-opss-walletfile-secret> ]\n+\n+```\n+\n+2. Modify the domain resource YAML file to provide the secret names:\n+\n+```\n+  configuration:\n+    opss:\n+      # Name of secret with walletPassword for extracting the wallet\n+      walletPasswordSecret: sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret      \n+      # Name of secret with walletFile containing base64 encoded opss wallet\n+      walletFileSecret: sample-domain1-opss-walletfile-secret\n+\n+```\n+\n+See [Reusing an RCU database]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/reusing-rcu.md\" >}}) for instructions.\n+\n+### Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image\n+\n+Model in Image must contain a WebLogic install, a WebLogic Deploy Tool install, and your WDT model files. You can use the sample `./build.sh` script to build this image, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Uses `docker pull` to obtain a base image.

Later, when you run the sample, it will call `docker pull` for your base image based on the domain type.\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4`.\n+       - For `WLS`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4`.\n+\n+   - __Option 2, create your own WebLogic base image.__\n+\n+     Alternatively, you can create your own base image and override the sample's default base image name and tag by exporting the `BASE_IMAGE_NAME` and `BASE_IMAGE_TAG` environment variables prior to running the sample scripts. If you want to create your own base image, see [Preparing a Base Image]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-in-image/base-images/_index.md\" >}}).\n+\n+8. If you are using a `JRF` domain type, then it requires an RCU infrastructure database. See [Prerequisites for JRF Domains](#prerequisites-for-jrf-domains). You can do this step before or after you create your final image. If you're not using a `JRF` domain type, proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image).\n+\n+### Prerequisites for JRF domains\n+\n+> __NOTE__: This section is only required for demonstrating a `JRF` domain type. Skip this section and proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image) if your domain type is `WLS` or `RestrictedJRF`.\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database called an RCU database, requires initializing this database, and requires configuring your domain to access this database. All of these steps must occur before you first deploy your domain.\n+\n+Furthermore, if you want to have a restarted JRF domain access updates to the infrastructure database that the domain made at an earlier time, the restarted domain must be supplied a wallet file that was obtained from a previous run of the domain.\n+\n+The following steps demonstrate how to set up an infrastructure database that will work with this sample:\n+\n+  1. [Set up and initialize an RCU database](#set-up-and-initialize-an-rcu-database).\n+  2. [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout).\n+  3. [Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets](#set-up-rcu-model-attributes-domain-resource-attributes-and-secrets).\n+  4. [Reusing or sharing RCU tables](#reusing-or-sharing-rcu-tables).\n+\n+\n+\n+##### Set up and initialize an RCU database\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database and also requires initializing this database with a schema and a set of tables. The following example shows how to set up a sample RCU database and use the RCU tool to create the infrastructure schema for a JRF domain. The RCU database is set up with the following attributes:\n+\n+| Attribute | Value |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| database Kubernetes namespace | `default` |\n+| database Kubernetes pod | `oracle-db` |\n+| database image | `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` |\n+| database password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| infrastructure schema prefix | `FMW1` |\n+| infrastructure schema password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| database URL | `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s` |\n+\n+\n+1. Ensure you have access to the database image, and then deploy it:\n+\n+   - Use a browser to log in to `https://container-registry.oracle.com`, select `database->enterprise` and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+   - Get the database image:\n+     - In the local shell, `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+     - In the local shell, `docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim`.\n+\n+\n+       {{% notice note %}} If a local Docker login and manual pull of `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` is not sufficient (for example, if you are using a remote Kubernetes cluster), then uncomment the `imagePullSecrets` stanza in `$WORKDIR/k8s-db-slim.yaml` and create the image pull secret as follows:\n+\n+              ```\n+              kubectl create secret docker-registry regsecret \\\n+                --docker-server=container-registry.oracle.com \\\n+                --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+                --docker-password=your-password \\\n+                --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+              ```\n+       {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+\n+   - Use the sample script in `$SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service` to create an Oracle database running in the pod, `oracle-db`.\n+\n+      **NOTE**: If your database image access requires the `regsecret` image pull secret that you optionally created above, then pass `-s regsecret` to the `start-db-service.sh` command line.\n+\n+     ```\n+     cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service\n+     start-db-service.sh\n+     ```\n+\n+     This script will deploy a database with the URL, `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`, and administration password, `Oradoc_db1`.\n+\n+     {{% notice warning %}} The Oracle database Docker images are supported only for non-production use. For more details, see My Oracle Support note: Oracle Support for Database Running on Docker (Doc ID 2216342.1) : All the data is gone when the database is restarted.\n+     {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+     **NOTE**: This step is based on the steps documented in [Run a Database](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/userguide/overview/database/).\n+\n+2. Use the sample script in `SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema` to create the RCU schema with the schema prefix `FMW1`.\n+\n+   Note that this script assumes `Oradoc_db1` is the DBA password, `Oradoc_db1` is the schema password, and that the database URL is `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema\n+   ./create-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1 -i container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4\n+   ```\n+\n+   __NOTE__:  If you need to drop the repository, use this command:\n+\n+   ```\n+   drop-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1\n+   ```\n+\n+\n+##### Increase introspection job timeout\n+\n+Because JRF domain home creation takes a considerable amount of time the first time it is created, and because Model in Image creates your domain home for you using the introspection job, you should increase the timeout for the introspection job. Use the `configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds` in `k8s-domain.yaml.template` to override the default with a value of at least 300 seconds (the default is 120 seconds).  \n+\n+##### Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets\n+\n+To allow Model in Image to access the RCU database and OPSS wallet, it's necessary to set up an RCU access secret and an OPSS secret before deploying your domain. It's also necessary to define an `RCUDbInfo` stanza in your model. The sample already sets up all of these for you.  See:\n+\n+| Sample file | Description |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, with `password=welcome1`. |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, with appropriate values for attributes `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string`. |\n+| `model1.yaml.jrf` | Populates the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string` attributes by referencing their locations in the `sample-domain1-rcu-access` secret. The `build.sh` script uses this model instead of `model.yaml.wls` when the source domain type is `JRF`. |\n+| `k8s-domain.yaml.template` | Ensures that the domain mounts the OPSS key secret by setting the domain resource `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` attribute to `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, and ensures the domain mounts the RCU access secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, for reference by WDT model macros by setting the domain resource `configuration.secrets` attribute. Use configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds to increase the timeout value of the introspector job; see [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout). |\n+\n+ **NOTE**: This step is for information purposes only. Do not run the above sample files directly. The sample's main build and run scripts will run them for you.\n+\n+##### Reusing or sharing RCU tables\n+\n+Note that when you succesfully deploy your JRF domain resource for the first time, the introspector job will initialize the RCU tables for the domain using the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza in the WDT model plus the `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` specified in the domain resource. The job will also create a new domain home. Finally, the operator will also capture an OPSS wallet file from the new domain's local directory and place this file in a new Kubernetes config map.\n+\n+There are scenarios when the domain needs to be re-created between updates such as WebLogic credentials are changed, security roles defined in the WDT model have been changed or you want to share the same RCU tables with different domains.  Under these scenarios, the operator needs the `walletPasswordSecret` as well as the OPSS wallet file, together with the exact information in `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` so that the domain can be re-created and access the same set of RCU tables.  Without the wallet file and wallet password, you will not be able to re-create a domain accessing the same set of RCU tables, therefore it is highly recommended to backup the wallet file.\n+\n+To recover a domain's RCU tables between domain restarts or to share an RCU schema between different domains, it is necessary to extract this wallet file from the config map and save the OPSS wallet password secret that was used for the original domain. The wallet password and wallet file are needed again when you recreate the domain or share the database with other domains.\n+\n+To save the wallet file:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -s [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>]\n+```\n+\n+You should back up this file to a safe location that can be retrieved later.\n+\n+To reuse the wallet for subsequent redeployments or share the RCU tables between different domains:\n+\n+1. Store the wallet in a secret:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -r [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>] [-ws <name of the secret. Default DOMAIN_UID-opss-walletfile-secret> ]\n+\n+```\n+\n+2. Modify the domain resource YAML file to provide the secret names:\n+\n+```\n+  configuration:\n+    opss:\n+      # Name of secret with walletPassword for extracting the wallet\n+      walletPasswordSecret: sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret      \n+      # Name of secret with walletFile containing base64 encoded opss wallet\n+      walletFileSecret: sample-domain1-opss-walletfile-secret\n+\n+```\n+\n+See [Reusing an RCU database]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/reusing-rcu.md\" >}}) for instructions.\n+\n+### Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image\n+\n+Model in Image must contain a WebLogic install, a WebLogic Deploy Tool install, and your WDT model files. You can use the sample `./build.sh` script to build this image, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Uses `docker pull` to obtain a base image.

Similarly, `RestrictedJRF` domains may be used by Oracle layered products such as Oracle Communications products.\n+\n+### References\n+\n+To reference the relevant user documentation, see:\n+ - [Model in Image User Guide]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) user documentation\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Server Deploy Tooling](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling)\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool)\n+\n+\n+\n+### Prerequisites for all domain types\n+\n+1. The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable must be set and must reference a valid JDK8 installation. (`JAVA_HOME` is used by the WebLogic Image Tool.)\n+\n+2. Set a source directory environment variable `SRCDIR` that references the parent of the operator source tree. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   mkdir ~/wlopsrc\n+   cd ~/wlopsrc\n+   git clone https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator.git\n+   export SRCDIR=$(pwd)/weblogic-kubernetes-operator\n+   ```\n+\n+   For additional information about obtaining the operator source, see the [Developer Guide Requirements](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/developerguide/requirements/).\n+\n+3. Create a sample directory environment variable `SAMPLEDIR` that references this sample's directory:\n+\n+   ```\n+   export SAMPLEDIR=${SRCDIR}/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image/\n+   ```\n+\n+4. Create an empty, temporary working directory with 10g of space, and store its location in the `WORKDIR` environment variable. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd <location of empty temporary directory with 10g of space>\n+   export WORKDIR=$(pwd)\n+   ```\n+\n+5. Deploy the operator and set up the operator to manage the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`. Optionally, deploy a Traefik load balancer that manages the same namespace. For example, follow the same steps as the [Quick Start](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/quickstart/), up through the [Prepare for a domain]({{< relref \"/quickstart/prepare.md\" >}}) step.\n+\n+   Note that:\n+   - Deploying the Traefik load balancer is optional, but is a prerequisite for testing the web application that's deployed to WebLogic as part of this sample.\n+   - You can skip the Quick Start steps for obtaining a WebLogic image because you will be creating your own Docker image.\n+\n+\n+6. Choose the type of domain you're going to create: `WLS`, `JRF`, or `RestrictedJRF`, and set the environment variable, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, accordingly. The default is `WLS`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   export WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE=<one of WLS, JRF, or RestrictedJRF>\n+   ```\n+\n+7. Set up access to a base image for this sample that will be used as the base image for creating the final image. Do one of the following:\n+\n+   - __Option 1, download an existing WebLogic image.__\n+\n+     Set up access to this sample's base WebLogic image at the [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com):\n+\n+     a. Use a browser to access [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com).\n+\n+     b. Choose an image location:\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF` domains, select `Middleware`, then `fmw-infrastructure`.\n+       - For `WLS` domains, select `Middleware`, then `weblogic`.\n+\n+     c. Select Sign In and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+     d. Use your terminal to locally log in to Docker: `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+\n+     e. Later, when you run the sample, it will call `docker pull` for your base image based on the domain type.\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4`.\n+       - For `WLS`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4`.\n+\n+   - __Option 2, create your own WebLogic base image.__\n+\n+     Alternatively, you can create your own base image and override the sample's default base image name and tag by exporting the `BASE_IMAGE_NAME` and `BASE_IMAGE_TAG` environment variables prior to running the sample scripts.

If you are using a `JRF` domain type, then it requires an RCU infrastructure database. See [Prerequisites for JRF Domains](#prerequisites-for-jrf-domains). You can do this step before or after you create your final image.

The following example shows how to set up a sample RCU database and use the RCU tool to create the infrastructure schema for a JRF domain. The RCU database is set up with the following attributes:\n+\n+| Attribute | Value |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| database Kubernetes namespace | `default` |\n+| database Kubernetes pod | `oracle-db` |\n+| database image | `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` |\n+| database password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| infrastructure schema prefix | `FMW1` |\n+| infrastructure schema password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| database URL | `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s` |\n+\n+\n+1. Ensure you have access to the database image, and then deploy it:\n+\n+   - Use a browser to log in to `https://container-registry.oracle.com`, select `database->enterprise` and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+   - Get the database image:\n+     - In the local shell, `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+     - In the local shell, `docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim`.\n+\n+\n+       {{% notice note %}} If a local Docker login and manual pull of `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` is not sufficient (for example, if you are using a remote Kubernetes cluster), then uncomment the `imagePullSecrets` stanza in `$WORKDIR/k8s-db-slim.yaml` and create the image pull secret as follows:\n+\n+              ```\n+              kubectl create secret docker-registry regsecret \\\n+                --docker-server=container-registry.oracle.com \\\n+                --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+                --docker-password=your-password \\\n+                --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+              ```\n+       {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+\n+   - Use the sample script in `$SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service` to create an Oracle database running in the pod, `oracle-db`.\n+\n+      **NOTE**: If your database image access requires the `regsecret` image pull secret that you optionally created above, then pass `-s regsecret` to the `start-db-service.sh` command line.\n+\n+     ```\n+     cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service\n+     start-db-service.sh\n+     ```\n+\n+     This script will deploy a database with the URL, `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`, and administration password, `Oradoc_db1`.\n+\n+     {{% notice warning %}} The Oracle database Docker images are supported only for non-production use.

The sample's main build and run scripts will run them for you.\n+\n+##### Reusing or sharing RCU tables\n+\n+Note that when you succesfully deploy your JRF domain resource for the first time, the introspector job will initialize the RCU tables for the domain using the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza in the WDT model plus the `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` specified in the domain resource. The job will also create a new domain home. Finally, the operator will also capture an OPSS wallet file from the new domain's local directory and place this file in a new Kubernetes config map.\n+\n+There are scenarios when the domain needs to be re-created between updates such as WebLogic credentials are changed, security roles defined in the WDT model have been changed or you want to share the same RCU tables with different domains.  Under these scenarios, the operator needs the `walletPasswordSecret` as well as the OPSS wallet file, together with the exact information in `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` so that the domain can be re-created and access the same set of RCU tables.  Without the wallet file and wallet password, you will not be able to re-create a domain accessing the same set of RCU tables, therefore it is highly recommended to backup the wallet file.\n+\n+To recover a domain's RCU tables between domain restarts or to share an RCU schema between different domains, it is necessary to extract this wallet file from the config map and save the OPSS wallet password secret that was used for the original domain.

Similarly, `RestrictedJRF` domains may be used by Oracle layered products such as Oracle Communications products.\n+\n+### References\n+\n+To reference the relevant user documentation, see:\n+ - [Model in Image User Guide]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) user documentation\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Server Deploy Tooling](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling)\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool)\n+\n+\n+\n+### Prerequisites for all domain types\n+\n+1. The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable must be set and must reference a valid JDK8 installation. (`JAVA_HOME` is used by the WebLogic Image Tool.)\n+\n+2. Set a source directory environment variable `SRCDIR` that references the parent of the operator source tree. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   mkdir ~/wlopsrc\n+   cd ~/wlopsrc\n+   git clone https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator.git\n+   export SRCDIR=$(pwd)/weblogic-kubernetes-operator\n+   ```\n+\n+   For additional information about obtaining the operator source, see the [Developer Guide Requirements](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/developerguide/requirements/).\n+\n+3. Create a sample directory environment variable `SAMPLEDIR` that references this sample's directory:\n+\n+   ```\n+   export SAMPLEDIR=${SRCDIR}/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image/\n+   ```\n+\n+4. Create an empty, temporary working directory with 10g of space, and store its location in the `WORKDIR` environment variable. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd <location of empty temporary directory with 10g of space>\n+   export WORKDIR=$(pwd)\n+   ```\n+\n+5. Deploy the operator and set up the operator to manage the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`. Optionally, deploy a Traefik load balancer that manages the same namespace. For example, follow the same steps as the [Quick Start](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/quickstart/), up through the [Prepare for a domain]({{< relref \"/quickstart/prepare.md\" >}}) step.\n+\n+   Note that:\n+   - Deploying the Traefik load balancer is optional, but is a prerequisite for testing the web application that's deployed to WebLogic as part of this sample.\n+   - You can skip the Quick Start steps for obtaining a WebLogic image because you will be creating your own Docker image.\n+\n+\n+6. Choose the type of domain you're going to create: `WLS`, `JRF`, or `RestrictedJRF`, and set the environment variable, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, accordingly. The default is `WLS`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   export WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE=<one of WLS, JRF, or RestrictedJRF>\n+   ```\n+\n+7. Set up access to a base image for this sample that will be used as the base image for creating the final image. Do one of the following:\n+\n+   - __Option 1, download an existing WebLogic image.__\n+\n+     Set up access to this sample's base WebLogic image at the [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com):\n+\n+     a. Use a browser to access [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com).\n+\n+     b. Choose an image location:\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF` domains, select `Middleware`, then `fmw-infrastructure`.\n+       - For `WLS` domains, select `Middleware`, then `weblogic`.\n+\n+     c. Select Sign In and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+     d. Use your terminal to locally log in to Docker: `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+\n+     e. Later, when you run the sample, it will call `docker pull` for your base image based on the domain type.\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4`.\n+       - For `WLS`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4`.\n+\n+   - __Option 2, create your own WebLogic base image.__\n+\n+     Alternatively, you can create your own base image and override the sample's default base image name and tag by exporting the `BASE_IMAGE_NAME` and `BASE_IMAGE_TAG` environment variables prior to running the sample scripts. If you want to create your own base image, see [Preparing a Base Image]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-in-image/base-images/_index.md\" >}}).\n+\n+8. If you are using a `JRF` domain type, then it requires an RCU infrastructure database. See [Prerequisites for JRF Domains](#prerequisites-for-jrf-domains). You can do this step before or after you create your final image. If you're not using a `JRF` domain type, proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image).\n+\n+### Prerequisites for JRF domains\n+\n+> __NOTE__: This section is only required for demonstrating a `JRF` domain type. Skip this section and proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image) if your domain type is `WLS` or `RestrictedJRF`.\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database called an RCU database, requires initializing this database, and requires configuring your domain to access this database. All of these steps must occur before you first deploy your domain.\n+\n+Furthermore, if you want to have a restarted JRF domain access updates to the infrastructure database that the domain made at an earlier time, the restarted domain must be supplied a wallet file that was obtained from a previous run of the domain.\n+\n+The following steps demonstrate how to set up an infrastructure database that will work with this sample:\n+\n+  1. [Set up and initialize an RCU database](#set-up-and-initialize-an-rcu-database).\n+  2. [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout).\n+  3. [Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets](#set-up-rcu-model-attributes-domain-resource-attributes-and-secrets).\n+  4. [Reusing or sharing RCU tables](#reusing-or-sharing-rcu-tables).\n+\n+\n+\n+##### Set up and initialize an RCU database\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database and also requires initializing this database with a schema and a set of tables. The following example shows how to set up a sample RCU database and use the RCU tool to create the infrastructure schema for a JRF domain. The RCU database is set up with the following attributes:\n+\n+| Attribute | Value |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| database Kubernetes namespace | `default` |\n+| database Kubernetes pod | `oracle-db` |\n+| database image | `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` |\n+| database password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| infrastructure schema prefix | `FMW1` |\n+| infrastructure schema password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| database URL | `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s` |\n+\n+\n+1. Ensure you have access to the database image, and then deploy it:\n+\n+   - Use a browser to log in to `https://container-registry.oracle.com`, select `database->enterprise` and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+   - Get the database image:\n+     - In the local shell, `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+     - In the local shell, `docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim`.\n+\n+\n+       {{% notice note %}} If a local Docker login and manual pull of `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` is not sufficient (for example, if you are using a remote Kubernetes cluster), then uncomment the `imagePullSecrets` stanza in `$WORKDIR/k8s-db-slim.yaml` and create the image pull secret as follows:\n+\n+              ```\n+              kubectl create secret docker-registry regsecret \\\n+                --docker-server=container-registry.oracle.com \\\n+                --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+                --docker-password=your-password \\\n+                --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+              ```\n+       {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+\n+   - Use the sample script in `$SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service` to create an Oracle database running in the pod, `oracle-db`.\n+\n+      **NOTE**: If your database image access requires the `regsecret` image pull secret that you optionally created above, then pass `-s regsecret` to the `start-db-service.sh` command line.\n+\n+     ```\n+     cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service\n+     start-db-service.sh\n+     ```\n+\n+     This script will deploy a database with the URL, `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`, and administration password, `Oradoc_db1`.\n+\n+     {{% notice warning %}} The Oracle database Docker images are supported only for non-production use. For more details, see My Oracle Support note: Oracle Support for Database Running on Docker (Doc ID 2216342.1) : All the data is gone when the database is restarted.\n+     {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+     **NOTE**: This step is based on the steps documented in [Run a Database](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/userguide/overview/database/).\n+\n+2. Use the sample script in `SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema` to create the RCU schema with the schema prefix `FMW1`.\n+\n+   Note that this script assumes `Oradoc_db1` is the DBA password, `Oradoc_db1` is the schema password, and that the database URL is `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema\n+   ./create-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1 -i container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4\n+   ```\n+\n+   __NOTE__:  If you need to drop the repository, use this command:\n+\n+   ```\n+   drop-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1\n+   ```\n+\n+\n+##### Increase introspection job timeout\n+\n+Because JRF domain home creation takes a considerable amount of time the first time it is created, and because Model in Image creates your domain home for you using the introspection job, you should increase the timeout for the introspection job. Use the `configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds` in `k8s-domain.yaml.template` to override the default with a value of at least 300 seconds (the default is 120 seconds).  \n+\n+##### Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets\n+\n+To allow Model in Image to access the RCU database and OPSS wallet, it's necessary to set up an RCU access secret and an OPSS secret before deploying your domain. It's also necessary to define an `RCUDbInfo` stanza in your model. The sample already sets up all of these for you.  See:\n+\n+| Sample file | Description |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, with `password=welcome1`. |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, with appropriate values for attributes `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string`. |\n+| `model1.yaml.jrf` | Populates the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string` attributes by referencing their locations in the `sample-domain1-rcu-access` secret. The `build.sh` script uses this model instead of `model.yaml.wls` when the source domain type is `JRF`. |\n+| `k8s-domain.yaml.template` | Ensures that the domain mounts the OPSS key secret by setting the domain resource `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` attribute to `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, and ensures the domain mounts the RCU access secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, for reference by WDT model macros by setting the domain resource `configuration.secrets` attribute. Use configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds to increase the timeout value of the introspector job; see [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout). |\n+\n+ **NOTE**: This step is for information purposes only. Do not run the above sample files directly. The sample's main build and run scripts will run them for you.\n+\n+##### Reusing or sharing RCU tables\n+\n+Note that when you succesfully deploy your JRF domain resource for the first time, the introspector job will initialize the RCU tables for the domain using the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza in the WDT model plus the `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` specified in the domain resource. The job will also create a new domain home. Finally, the operator will also capture an OPSS wallet file from the new domain's local directory and place this file in a new Kubernetes config map.\n+\n+There are scenarios when the domain needs to be re-created between updates such as WebLogic credentials are changed, security roles defined in the WDT model have been changed or you want to share the same RCU tables with different domains.

For example, follow the same steps as the [Quick Start](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/quickstart/), up through the [Prepare for a domain]({{< relref \"/quickstart/prepare.md\" >}}) step.\n+\n+   Note that:\n+   - Deploying the Traefik load balancer is optional, but is a prerequisite for testing the web application that's deployed to WebLogic as part of this sample.\n+   - You can skip the Quick Start steps for obtaining a WebLogic image because you will be creating your own Docker image.\n+\n+\n+6. Choose the type of domain you're going to create: `WLS`, `JRF`, or `RestrictedJRF`, and set the environment variable, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, accordingly. The default is `WLS`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   export WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE=<one of WLS, JRF, or RestrictedJRF>\n+   ```\n+\n+7. Set up access to a base image for this sample that will be used as the base image for creating the final image. Do one of the following:\n+\n+   - __Option 1, download an existing WebLogic image.__\n+\n+     Set up access to this sample's base WebLogic image at the [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com):\n+\n+     a. Use a browser to access [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com).\n+\n+     b. Choose an image location:\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF` domains, select `Middleware`, then `fmw-infrastructure`.\n+       - For `WLS` domains, select `Middleware`, then `weblogic`.\n+\n+     c. Select Sign In and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+     d. Use your terminal to locally log in to Docker: `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+\n+     e. Later, when you run the sample, it will call `docker pull` for your base image based on the domain type.\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4`.\n+       - For `WLS`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4`.\n+\n+   - __Option 2, create your own WebLogic base image.__\n+\n+     Alternatively, you can create your own base image and override the sample's default base image name and tag by exporting the `BASE_IMAGE_NAME` and `BASE_IMAGE_TAG` environment variables prior to running the sample scripts.

[Reusing or sharing RCU tables](#reusing-or-sharing-rcu-tables).\n+\n+\n+\n+##### Set up and initialize an RCU database\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database and also requires initializing this database with a schema and a set of tables. The following example shows how to set up a sample RCU database and use the RCU tool to create the infrastructure schema for a JRF domain. The RCU database is set up with the following attributes:\n+\n+| Attribute | Value |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| database Kubernetes namespace | `default` |\n+| database Kubernetes pod | `oracle-db` |\n+| database image | `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` |\n+| database password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| infrastructure schema prefix | `FMW1` |\n+| infrastructure schema password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| database URL | `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s` |\n+\n+\n+1. Ensure you have access to the database image, and then deploy it:\n+\n+   - Use a browser to log in to `https://container-registry.oracle.com`, select `database->enterprise` and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+   - Get the database image:\n+     - In the local shell, `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+     - In the local shell, `docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim`.\n+\n+\n+       {{% notice note %}} If a local Docker login and manual pull of `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` is not sufficient (for example, if you are using a remote Kubernetes cluster), then uncomment the `imagePullSecrets` stanza in `$WORKDIR/k8s-db-slim.yaml` and create the image pull secret as follows:\n+\n+              ```\n+              kubectl create secret docker-registry regsecret \\\n+                --docker-server=container-registry.oracle.com \\\n+                --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+                --docker-password=your-password \\\n+                --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+              ```\n+       {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+\n+   - Use the sample script in `$SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service` to create an Oracle database running in the pod, `oracle-db`.\n+\n+      **NOTE**: If your database image access requires the `regsecret` image pull secret that you optionally created above, then pass `-s regsecret` to the `start-db-service.sh` command line.\n+\n+     ```\n+     cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service\n+     start-db-service.sh\n+     ```\n+\n+     This script will deploy a database with the URL, `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`, and administration password, `Oradoc_db1`.\n+\n+     {{% notice warning %}} The Oracle database Docker images are supported only for non-production use. For more details, see My Oracle Support note: Oracle Support for Database Running on Docker (Doc ID 2216342.1) : All the data is gone when the database is restarted.\n+     {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+     **NOTE**: This step is based on the steps documented in [Run a Database](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/userguide/overview/database/).\n+\n+2. Use the sample script in `SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema` to create the RCU schema with the schema prefix `FMW1`.\n+\n+   Note that this script assumes `Oradoc_db1` is the DBA password, `Oradoc_db1` is the schema password, and that the database URL is `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema\n+   ./create-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1 -i container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4\n+   ```\n+\n+   __NOTE__:  If you need to drop the repository, use this command:\n+\n+   ```\n+   drop-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1\n+   ```\n+\n+\n+##### Increase introspection job timeout\n+\n+Because JRF domain home creation takes a considerable amount of time the first time it is created, and because Model in Image creates your domain home for you using the introspection job, you should increase the timeout for the introspection job. Use the `configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds` in `k8s-domain.yaml.template` to override the default with a value of at least 300 seconds (the default is 120 seconds).  \n+\n+##### Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets\n+\n+To allow Model in Image to access the RCU database and OPSS wallet, it's necessary to set up an RCU access secret and an OPSS secret before deploying your domain. It's also necessary to define an `RCUDbInfo` stanza in your model. The sample already sets up all of these for you.  See:\n+\n+| Sample file | Description |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, with `password=welcome1`. |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, with appropriate values for attributes `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string`. |\n+| `model1.yaml.jrf` | Populates the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string` attributes by referencing their locations in the `sample-domain1-rcu-access` secret. The `build.sh` script uses this model instead of `model.yaml.wls` when the source domain type is `JRF`. |\n+| `k8s-domain.yaml.template` | Ensures that the domain mounts the OPSS key secret by setting the domain resource `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` attribute to `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, and ensures the domain mounts the RCU access secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, for reference by WDT model macros by setting the domain resource `configuration.secrets` attribute. Use configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds to increase the timeout value of the introspector job; see [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout). |\n+\n+ **NOTE**: This step is for information purposes only. Do not run the above sample files directly. The sample's main build and run scripts will run them for you.\n+\n+##### Reusing or sharing RCU tables\n+\n+Note that when you succesfully deploy your JRF domain resource for the first time, the introspector job will initialize the RCU tables for the domain using the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza in the WDT model plus the `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` specified in the domain resource. The job will also create a new domain home. Finally, the operator will also capture an OPSS wallet file from the new domain's local directory and place this file in a new Kubernetes config map.\n+\n+There are scenarios when the domain needs to be re-created between updates such as WebLogic credentials are changed, security roles defined in the WDT model have been changed or you want to share the same RCU tables with different domains.  Under these scenarios, the operator needs the `walletPasswordSecret` as well as the OPSS wallet file, together with the exact information in `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` so that the domain can be re-created and access the same set of RCU tables.  Without the wallet file and wallet password, you will not be able to re-create a domain accessing the same set of RCU tables, therefore it is highly recommended to backup the wallet file.\n+\n+To recover a domain's RCU tables between domain restarts or to share an RCU schema between different domains, it is necessary to extract this wallet file from the config map and save the OPSS wallet password secret that was used for the original domain. The wallet password and wallet file are needed again when you recreate the domain or share the database with other domains.\n+\n+To save the wallet file:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -s [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>]\n+```\n+\n+You should back up this file to a safe location that can be retrieved later.\n+\n+To reuse the wallet for subsequent redeployments or share the RCU tables between different domains:\n+\n+1. Store the wallet in a secret:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -r [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>] [-ws <name of the secret. Default DOMAIN_UID-opss-walletfile-secret> ]\n+\n+```\n+\n+2. Modify the domain resource YAML file to provide the secret names:\n+\n+```\n+  configuration:\n+    opss:\n+      # Name of secret with walletPassword for extracting the wallet\n+      walletPasswordSecret: sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret      \n+      # Name of secret with walletFile containing base64 encoded opss wallet\n+      walletFileSecret: sample-domain1-opss-walletfile-secret\n+\n+```\n+\n+See [Reusing an RCU database]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/reusing-rcu.md\" >}}) for instructions.\n+\n+### Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image\n+\n+Model in Image must contain a WebLogic install, a WebLogic Deploy Tool install, and your WDT model files. You can use the sample `./build.sh` script to build this image, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Uses `docker pull` to obtain a base image. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types) to set up access to the base image.)\n+  - Downloads the latest WebLogic Image Tool and WebLogic Deploy Tool to `WORKDIR`.\n+  - Creates and populates a staging directory `$WORKDIR/models` that contains your WDT model files and WDT application archive.\n+    - Builds  a simple servlet application in `$SAMPLEDIR/sample_app` into a WDT model application archive `$WORKDIR/models/archive1.zip`.\n+    - Copies sample model files from `$SAMPLEDIR/model-in-image` to `$WORKDIR/models`. This uses a model file that is appropriate to the domain type (for example, the `JRF` domain model includes database access configuration).\n+  - Uses the WebLogic Image Tool and the `$WORKDIR/models` staging directory to create a final image named `model-in-image:v1` that layers on the base image. Specifically, it runs the WebLogic Image Tool with its `update` option, which:\n+    - Builds the final image as a layer on the base image.\n+    - Puts a WDT install in image location, `/u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy`.\n+    - Copies the WDT model, properties, and application archive from `$WORDKIR/models` to image location, `/u01/wdt/models`.\n+\n+The script expects `JAVA_HOME`, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).)\n+\n+Run the script:\n+\n+  ```\n+  $SAMPLEDIR/build.sh\n+  ```\n+\n+If you intend to use a remote Docker registry, you need to tag and push the image to the remote Docker registry.\n+\n+1.  Tag the image for the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker tag <image-name>:<tag> <region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>:<tag>", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "81623b1d513bbbfa1f2ca588a8d757daf2e38202"}, "originalPosition": 284}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5Njc4MzU1Mw==", "bodyText": "Tom AI: Change \"docker tag : .ocir.io///:\" to \"docker tag model-in-image:v1 my.remote.registry.com/model-in-image:v1\".

Similarly, `RestrictedJRF` domains may be used by Oracle layered products such as Oracle Communications products.\n+\n+### References\n+\n+To reference the relevant user documentation, see:\n+ - [Model in Image User Guide]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) user documentation\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Server Deploy Tooling](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling)\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool)\n+\n+\n+\n+### Prerequisites for all domain types\n+\n+1. The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable must be set and must reference a valid JDK8 installation. (`JAVA_HOME` is used by the WebLogic Image Tool.)\n+\n+2. Set a source directory environment variable `SRCDIR` that references the parent of the operator source tree. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   mkdir ~/wlopsrc\n+   cd ~/wlopsrc\n+   git clone https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator.git\n+   export SRCDIR=$(pwd)/weblogic-kubernetes-operator\n+   ```\n+\n+   For additional information about obtaining the operator source, see the [Developer Guide Requirements](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/developerguide/requirements/).\n+\n+3.

Create an empty, temporary working directory with 10g of space, and store its location in the `WORKDIR` environment variable. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd <location of empty temporary directory with 10g of space>\n+   export WORKDIR=$(pwd)\n+   ```\n+\n+5. Deploy the operator and set up the operator to manage the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`. Optionally, deploy a Traefik load balancer that manages the same namespace.

The sample's main build and run scripts will run them for you.\n+\n+##### Reusing or sharing RCU tables\n+\n+Note that when you succesfully deploy your JRF domain resource for the first time, the introspector job will initialize the RCU tables for the domain using the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza in the WDT model plus the `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` specified in the domain resource. The job will also create a new domain home. Finally, the operator will also capture an OPSS wallet file from the new domain's local directory and place this file in a new Kubernetes config map.\n+\n+There are scenarios when the domain needs to be re-created between updates such as WebLogic credentials are changed, security roles defined in the WDT model have been changed or you want to share the same RCU tables with different domains.  Under these scenarios, the operator needs the `walletPasswordSecret` as well as the OPSS wallet file, together with the exact information in `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` so that the domain can be re-created and access the same set of RCU tables.

You can use the sample `./build.sh` script to build this image, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Uses `docker pull` to obtain a base image. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types) to set up access to the base image.)\n+  - Downloads the latest WebLogic Image Tool and WebLogic Deploy Tool to `WORKDIR`.\n+  - Creates and populates a staging directory `$WORKDIR/models` that contains your WDT model files and WDT application archive.\n+    - Builds  a simple servlet application in `$SAMPLEDIR/sample_app` into a WDT model application archive `$WORKDIR/models/archive1.zip`.\n+    - Copies sample model files from `$SAMPLEDIR/model-in-image` to `$WORKDIR/models`. This uses a model file that is appropriate to the domain type (for example, the `JRF` domain model includes database access configuration).\n+  - Uses the WebLogic Image Tool and the `$WORKDIR/models` staging directory to create a final image named `model-in-image:v1` that layers on the base image. Specifically, it runs the WebLogic Image Tool with its `update` option, which:\n+    - Builds the final image as a layer on the base image.\n+    - Puts a WDT install in image location, `/u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy`.\n+    - Copies the WDT model, properties, and application archive from `$WORDKIR/models` to image location, `/u01/wdt/models`.\n+\n+The script expects `JAVA_HOME`, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).)\n+\n+Run the script:\n+\n+  ```\n+  $SAMPLEDIR/build.sh\n+  ```\n+\n+If you intend to use a remote Docker registry, you need to tag and push the image to the remote Docker registry.\n+\n+1.  Tag the image for the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker tag <image-name>:<tag> <region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>:<tag>", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5NTk1MTI0MQ=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "81623b1d513bbbfa1f2ca588a8d757daf2e38202"}, "originalPosition": 284}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5NzQ5NzYwOQ==", "bodyText": "Done.", "url": "https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/pull/1478#discussion_r397497609", "createdAt": "2020-03-24T22:22:37Z", "author": {"login": "tbarnes-us"}, "path": "docs-source/content/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,520 @@\n+---\n+title: \"Model in image\"\n+date: 2019-02-23T17:32:31-05:00\n+weight: 4\n+description: \"Sample for supplying a WebLogic Deploy Tool (WDT) model that the operator automatically expands into a full domain home during runtime.\"\n+---\n+\n+### Contents\n+\n+  - [Introduction](#introduction)\n+  - [References](#references)\n+  - [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types)\n+  - [Prerequisites for JRF domains](#prerequisites-for-jrf-domains)\n+    - [Set Up and Initialize an RCU Database](#set-up-and-initialize-an-rcu-database)\n+    - [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout)\n+    - [Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets](#set-up-rcu-model-attributes-domain-resource-attributes-and-secrets)\n+    - [Reusing or sharing RCU tables](#reusing-or-sharing-rcu-tables)\n+  - [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image)\n+  - [Create and deploy your Kubernetes resources](#create-and-deploy-your-kubernetes-resources)\n+  - [Optionally test the sample application](#optionally-test-the-sample-application)\n+  - [Optionally access the WebLogic console](#optionally-access-the-weblogic-console)\n+  - [Cleanup](#cleanup)\n+\n+### Introduction\n+\n+This sample demonstrates:\n+\n+  - Using the WebLogic Image Tool to create a Docker image that contains a WebLogic install, a WebLogic Deploy Tool (WDT) install, a Java EE servlet application contained within a WDT archive, and a WebLogic domain that's defined using a WDT model file.\n+  - Modifying the WDT model that's embedded within the Docker image using a WDT model file that's supplied using a Kubernetes config map.\n+  - Defining a `domainHomeSourceType: FromModel` domain resource that references the WDT model image and the WDT config map.\n+  - Deploying the model image, domain resource, model config map, and associated secrets that define user names, passwords, and URL values for the model and its domain resource.\n+  - Deploying and accessing a Traefik load balancer that redirects HTTP protocol calls to its Java EE servlet application.\n+\n+Supported domain types:\n+\n+There are three types of domains supported by Model in Image: a standard `WLS` domain, an Oracle Fusion Middleware Infrastructure Java Required Files (`JRF`) domain, or a `RestrictedJRF` domain.\n+\n+The `JRF` domain path through the sample includes additional steps for deploying an infrastructure database and initializing the database using the Repository Creation Utility (RCU) tool. `JRF` domains may be  used by Oracle products that layer on top of WebLogic Server such as SOA, OSB, and FA. Similarly, `RestrictedJRF` domains may be used by Oracle layered products such as Oracle Communications products.\n+\n+### References\n+\n+To reference the relevant user documentation, see:\n+ - [Model in Image User Guide]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) user documentation\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Server Deploy Tooling](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling)\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool)\n+\n+\n+\n+### Prerequisites for all domain types\n+\n+1. The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable must be set and must reference a valid JDK8 installation. (`JAVA_HOME` is used by the WebLogic Image Tool.)\n+\n+2. Set a source directory environment variable `SRCDIR` that references the parent of the operator source tree. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   mkdir ~/wlopsrc\n+   cd ~/wlopsrc\n+   git clone https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator.git\n+   export SRCDIR=$(pwd)/weblogic-kubernetes-operator\n+   ```\n+\n+   For additional information about obtaining the operator source, see the [Developer Guide Requirements](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/developerguide/requirements/).\n+\n+3. Create a sample directory environment variable `SAMPLEDIR` that references this sample's directory:\n+\n+   ```\n+   export SAMPLEDIR=${SRCDIR}/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image/\n+   ```\n+\n+4. Create an empty, temporary working directory with 10g of space, and store its location in the `WORKDIR` environment variable. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd <location of empty temporary directory with 10g of space>\n+   export WORKDIR=$(pwd)\n+   ```\n+\n+5. Deploy the operator and set up the operator to manage the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`. Optionally, deploy a Traefik load balancer that manages the same namespace. For example, follow the same steps as the [Quick Start](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/quickstart/), up through the [Prepare for a domain]({{< relref \"/quickstart/prepare.md\" >}}) step.\n+\n+   Note that:\n+   - Deploying the Traefik load balancer is optional, but is a prerequisite for testing the web application that's deployed to WebLogic as part of this sample.\n+   - You can skip the Quick Start steps for obtaining a WebLogic image because you will be creating your own Docker image.\n+\n+\n+6. Choose the type of domain you're going to create: `WLS`, `JRF`, or `RestrictedJRF`, and set the environment variable, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, accordingly. The default is `WLS`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   export WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE=<one of WLS, JRF, or RestrictedJRF>\n+   ```\n+\n+7. Set up access to a base image for this sample that will be used as the base image for creating the final image. Do one of the following:\n+\n+   - __Option 1, download an existing WebLogic image.__\n+\n+     Set up access to this sample's base WebLogic image at the [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com):\n+\n+     a. Use a browser to access [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com).\n+\n+     b. Choose an image location:\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF` domains, select `Middleware`, then `fmw-infrastructure`.\n+       - For `WLS` domains, select `Middleware`, then `weblogic`.\n+\n+     c. Select Sign In and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+     d. Use your terminal to locally log in to Docker: `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+\n+     e. Later, when you run the sample, it will call `docker pull` for your base image based on the domain type.\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4`.\n+       - For `WLS`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4`.\n+\n+   - __Option 2, create your own WebLogic base image.__\n+\n+     Alternatively, you can create your own base image and override the sample's default base image name and tag by exporting the `BASE_IMAGE_NAME` and `BASE_IMAGE_TAG` environment variables prior to running the sample scripts. If you want to create your own base image, see [Preparing a Base Image]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-in-image/base-images/_index.md\" >}}).\n+\n+8. If you are using a `JRF` domain type, then it requires an RCU infrastructure database. See [Prerequisites for JRF Domains](#prerequisites-for-jrf-domains). You can do this step before or after you create your final image. If you're not using a `JRF` domain type, proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image).\n+\n+### Prerequisites for JRF domains\n+\n+> __NOTE__: This section is only required for demonstrating a `JRF` domain type. Skip this section and proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image) if your domain type is `WLS` or `RestrictedJRF`.\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database called an RCU database, requires initializing this database, and requires configuring your domain to access this database. All of these steps must occur before you first deploy your domain.\n+\n+Furthermore, if you want to have a restarted JRF domain access updates to the infrastructure database that the domain made at an earlier time, the restarted domain must be supplied a wallet file that was obtained from a previous run of the domain.\n+\n+The following steps demonstrate how to set up an infrastructure database that will work with this sample:\n+\n+  1. [Set up and initialize an RCU database](#set-up-and-initialize-an-rcu-database).\n+  2. [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout).\n+  3.

The following example shows how to set up a sample RCU database and use the RCU tool to create the infrastructure schema for a JRF domain. The RCU database is set up with the following attributes:\n+\n+| Attribute | Value |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| database Kubernetes namespace | `default` |\n+| database Kubernetes pod | `oracle-db` |\n+| database image | `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` |\n+| database password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| infrastructure schema prefix | `FMW1` |\n+| infrastructure schema password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| database URL | `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s` |\n+\n+\n+1.

You can use the sample `./build.sh` script to build this image, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Uses `docker pull` to obtain a base image. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types) to set up access to the base image.)\n+  - Downloads the latest WebLogic Image Tool and WebLogic Deploy Tool to `WORKDIR`.\n+  - Creates and populates a staging directory `$WORKDIR/models` that contains your WDT model files and WDT application archive.\n+    - Builds  a simple servlet application in `$SAMPLEDIR/sample_app` into a WDT model application archive `$WORKDIR/models/archive1.zip`.\n+    - Copies sample model files from `$SAMPLEDIR/model-in-image` to `$WORKDIR/models`. This uses a model file that is appropriate to the domain type (for example, the `JRF` domain model includes database access configuration).\n+  - Uses the WebLogic Image Tool and the `$WORKDIR/models` staging directory to create a final image named `model-in-image:v1` that layers on the base image. Specifically, it runs the WebLogic Image Tool with its `update` option, which:\n+    - Builds the final image as a layer on the base image.\n+    - Puts a WDT install in image location, `/u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy`.\n+    - Copies the WDT model, properties, and application archive from `$WORDKIR/models` to image location, `/u01/wdt/models`.\n+\n+The script expects `JAVA_HOME`, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).)\n+\n+Run the script:\n+\n+  ```\n+  $SAMPLEDIR/build.sh\n+  ```\n+\n+If you intend to use a remote Docker registry, you need to tag and push the image to the remote Docker registry.\n+\n+1.

Similarly, `RestrictedJRF` domains may be used by Oracle layered products such as Oracle Communications products.\n+\n+### References\n+\n+To reference the relevant user documentation, see:\n+ - [Model in Image User Guide]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) user documentation\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Server Deploy Tooling](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling)\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool)\n+\n+\n+\n+### Prerequisites for all domain types\n+\n+1. The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable must be set and must reference a valid JDK8 installation. (`JAVA_HOME` is used by the WebLogic Image Tool.)\n+\n+2. Set a source directory environment variable `SRCDIR` that references the parent of the operator source tree. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   mkdir ~/wlopsrc\n+   cd ~/wlopsrc\n+   git clone https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator.git\n+   export SRCDIR=$(pwd)/weblogic-kubernetes-operator\n+   ```\n+\n+   For additional information about obtaining the operator source, see the [Developer Guide Requirements](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/developerguide/requirements/).\n+\n+3. Create a sample directory environment variable `SAMPLEDIR` that references this sample's directory:\n+\n+   ```\n+   export SAMPLEDIR=${SRCDIR}/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image/\n+   ```\n+\n+4. Create an empty, temporary working directory with 10g of space, and store its location in the `WORKDIR` environment variable. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd <location of empty temporary directory with 10g of space>\n+   export WORKDIR=$(pwd)\n+   ```\n+\n+5. Deploy the operator and set up the operator to manage the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`. Optionally, deploy a Traefik load balancer that manages the same namespace. For example, follow the same steps as the [Quick Start](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/quickstart/), up through the [Prepare for a domain]({{< relref \"/quickstart/prepare.md\" >}}) step.\n+\n+   Note that:\n+   - Deploying the Traefik load balancer is optional, but is a prerequisite for testing the web application that's deployed to WebLogic as part of this sample.\n+   - You can skip the Quick Start steps for obtaining a WebLogic image because you will be creating your own Docker image.\n+\n+\n+6. Choose the type of domain you're going to create: `WLS`, `JRF`, or `RestrictedJRF`, and set the environment variable, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, accordingly. The default is `WLS`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   export WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE=<one of WLS, JRF, or RestrictedJRF>\n+   ```\n+\n+7. Set up access to a base image for this sample that will be used as the base image for creating the final image. Do one of the following:\n+\n+   - __Option 1, download an existing WebLogic image.__\n+\n+     Set up access to this sample's base WebLogic image at the [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com):\n+\n+     a. Use a browser to access [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com).\n+\n+     b. Choose an image location:\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF` domains, select `Middleware`, then `fmw-infrastructure`.\n+       - For `WLS` domains, select `Middleware`, then `weblogic`.\n+\n+     c. Select Sign In and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+     d. Use your terminal to locally log in to Docker: `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+\n+     e. Later, when you run the sample, it will call `docker pull` for your base image based on the domain type.\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4`.\n+       - For `WLS`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4`.\n+\n+   - __Option 2, create your own WebLogic base image.__\n+\n+     Alternatively, you can create your own base image and override the sample's default base image name and tag by exporting the `BASE_IMAGE_NAME` and `BASE_IMAGE_TAG` environment variables prior to running the sample scripts. If you want to create your own base image, see [Preparing a Base Image]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-in-image/base-images/_index.md\" >}}).\n+\n+8. If you are using a `JRF` domain type, then it requires an RCU infrastructure database. See [Prerequisites for JRF Domains](#prerequisites-for-jrf-domains). You can do this step before or after you create your final image. If you're not using a `JRF` domain type, proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image).\n+\n+### Prerequisites for JRF domains\n+\n+> __NOTE__: This section is only required for demonstrating a `JRF` domain type. Skip this section and proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image) if your domain type is `WLS` or `RestrictedJRF`.\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database called an RCU database, requires initializing this database, and requires configuring your domain to access this database. All of these steps must occur before you first deploy your domain.\n+\n+Furthermore, if you want to have a restarted JRF domain access updates to the infrastructure database that the domain made at an earlier time, the restarted domain must be supplied a wallet file that was obtained from a previous run of the domain.\n+\n+The following steps demonstrate how to set up an infrastructure database that will work with this sample:\n+\n+  1. [Set up and initialize an RCU database](#set-up-and-initialize-an-rcu-database).\n+  2. [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout).\n+  3. [Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets](#set-up-rcu-model-attributes-domain-resource-attributes-and-secrets).\n+  4. [Reusing or sharing RCU tables](#reusing-or-sharing-rcu-tables).\n+\n+\n+\n+##### Set up and initialize an RCU database\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database and also requires initializing this database with a schema and a set of tables. The following example shows how to set up a sample RCU database and use the RCU tool to create the infrastructure schema for a JRF domain. The RCU database is set up with the following attributes:\n+\n+| Attribute | Value |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| database Kubernetes namespace | `default` |\n+| database Kubernetes pod | `oracle-db` |\n+| database image | `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` |\n+| database password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| infrastructure schema prefix | `FMW1` |\n+| infrastructure schema password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| database URL | `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s` |\n+\n+\n+1. Ensure you have access to the database image, and then deploy it:\n+\n+   - Use a browser to log in to `https://container-registry.oracle.com`, select `database->enterprise` and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+   - Get the database image:\n+     - In the local shell, `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+     - In the local shell, `docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim`.\n+\n+\n+       {{% notice note %}} If a local Docker login and manual pull of `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` is not sufficient (for example, if you are using a remote Kubernetes cluster), then uncomment the `imagePullSecrets` stanza in `$WORKDIR/k8s-db-slim.yaml` and create the image pull secret as follows:\n+\n+              ```\n+              kubectl create secret docker-registry regsecret \\\n+                --docker-server=container-registry.oracle.com \\\n+                --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+                --docker-password=your-password \\\n+                --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+              ```\n+       {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+\n+   - Use the sample script in `$SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service` to create an Oracle database running in the pod, `oracle-db`.\n+\n+      **NOTE**: If your database image access requires the `regsecret` image pull secret that you optionally created above, then pass `-s regsecret` to the `start-db-service.sh` command line.\n+\n+     ```\n+     cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service\n+     start-db-service.sh\n+     ```\n+\n+     This script will deploy a database with the URL, `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`, and administration password, `Oradoc_db1`.\n+\n+     {{% notice warning %}} The Oracle database Docker images are supported only for non-production use. For more details, see My Oracle Support note: Oracle Support for Database Running on Docker (Doc ID 2216342.1) : All the data is gone when the database is restarted.\n+     {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+     **NOTE**: This step is based on the steps documented in [Run a Database](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/userguide/overview/database/).\n+\n+2. Use the sample script in `SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema` to create the RCU schema with the schema prefix `FMW1`.\n+\n+   Note that this script assumes `Oradoc_db1` is the DBA password, `Oradoc_db1` is the schema password, and that the database URL is `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema\n+   ./create-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1 -i container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4\n+   ```\n+\n+   __NOTE__:  If you need to drop the repository, use this command:\n+\n+   ```\n+   drop-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1\n+   ```\n+\n+\n+##### Increase introspection job timeout\n+\n+Because JRF domain home creation takes a considerable amount of time the first time it is created, and because Model in Image creates your domain home for you using the introspection job, you should increase the timeout for the introspection job. Use the `configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds` in `k8s-domain.yaml.template` to override the default with a value of at least 300 seconds (the default is 120 seconds).  \n+\n+##### Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets\n+\n+To allow Model in Image to access the RCU database and OPSS wallet, it's necessary to set up an RCU access secret and an OPSS secret before deploying your domain. It's also necessary to define an `RCUDbInfo` stanza in your model. The sample already sets up all of these for you.  See:\n+\n+| Sample file | Description |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, with `password=welcome1`. |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, with appropriate values for attributes `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string`. |\n+| `model1.yaml.jrf` | Populates the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string` attributes by referencing their locations in the `sample-domain1-rcu-access` secret. The `build.sh` script uses this model instead of `model.yaml.wls` when the source domain type is `JRF`. |\n+| `k8s-domain.yaml.template` | Ensures that the domain mounts the OPSS key secret by setting the domain resource `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` attribute to `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, and ensures the domain mounts the RCU access secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, for reference by WDT model macros by setting the domain resource `configuration.secrets` attribute. Use configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds to increase the timeout value of the introspector job; see [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout). |\n+\n+ **NOTE**: This step is for information purposes only. Do not run the above sample files directly. The sample's main build and run scripts will run them for you.\n+\n+##### Reusing or sharing RCU tables\n+\n+Note that when you succesfully deploy your JRF domain resource for the first time, the introspector job will initialize the RCU tables for the domain using the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza in the WDT model plus the `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` specified in the domain resource. The job will also create a new domain home. Finally, the operator will also capture an OPSS wallet file from the new domain's local directory and place this file in a new Kubernetes config map.\n+\n+There are scenarios when the domain needs to be re-created between updates such as WebLogic credentials are changed, security roles defined in the WDT model have been changed or you want to share the same RCU tables with different domains.  Under these scenarios, the operator needs the `walletPasswordSecret` as well as the OPSS wallet file, together with the exact information in `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` so that the domain can be re-created and access the same set of RCU tables.  Without the wallet file and wallet password, you will not be able to re-create a domain accessing the same set of RCU tables, therefore it is highly recommended to backup the wallet file.\n+\n+To recover a domain's RCU tables between domain restarts or to share an RCU schema between different domains, it is necessary to extract this wallet file from the config map and save the OPSS wallet password secret that was used for the original domain. The wallet password and wallet file are needed again when you recreate the domain or share the database with other domains.\n+\n+To save the wallet file:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -s [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>]\n+```\n+\n+You should back up this file to a safe location that can be retrieved later.\n+\n+To reuse the wallet for subsequent redeployments or share the RCU tables between different domains:\n+\n+1. Store the wallet in a secret:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -r [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>] [-ws <name of the secret. Default DOMAIN_UID-opss-walletfile-secret> ]\n+\n+```\n+\n+2. Modify the domain resource YAML file to provide the secret names:\n+\n+```\n+  configuration:\n+    opss:\n+      # Name of secret with walletPassword for extracting the wallet\n+      walletPasswordSecret: sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret      \n+      # Name of secret with walletFile containing base64 encoded opss wallet\n+      walletFileSecret: sample-domain1-opss-walletfile-secret\n+\n+```\n+\n+See [Reusing an RCU database]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/reusing-rcu.md\" >}}) for instructions.\n+\n+### Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image\n+\n+Model in Image must contain a WebLogic install, a WebLogic Deploy Tool install, and your WDT model files.

Similarly, `RestrictedJRF` domains may be used by Oracle layered products such as Oracle Communications products.\n+\n+### References\n+\n+To reference the relevant user documentation, see:\n+ - [Model in Image User Guide]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) user documentation\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Server Deploy Tooling](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling)\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool)\n+\n+\n+\n+### Prerequisites for all domain types\n+\n+1. The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable must be set and must reference a valid JDK8 installation. (`JAVA_HOME` is used by the WebLogic Image Tool.)\n+\n+2. Set a source directory environment variable `SRCDIR` that references the parent of the operator source tree. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   mkdir ~/wlopsrc\n+   cd ~/wlopsrc\n+   git clone https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator.git\n+   export SRCDIR=$(pwd)/weblogic-kubernetes-operator\n+   ```\n+\n+   For additional information about obtaining the operator source, see the [Developer Guide Requirements](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/developerguide/requirements/).\n+\n+3. Create a sample directory environment variable `SAMPLEDIR` that references this sample's directory:\n+\n+   ```\n+   export SAMPLEDIR=${SRCDIR}/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image/\n+   ```\n+\n+4. Create an empty, temporary working directory with 10g of space, and store its location in the `WORKDIR` environment variable. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd <location of empty temporary directory with 10g of space>\n+   export WORKDIR=$(pwd)\n+   ```\n+\n+5. Deploy the operator and set up the operator to manage the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`. Optionally, deploy a Traefik load balancer that manages the same namespace. For example, follow the same steps as the [Quick Start](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/quickstart/), up through the [Prepare for a domain]({{< relref \"/quickstart/prepare.md\" >}}) step.\n+\n+   Note that:\n+   - Deploying the Traefik load balancer is optional, but is a prerequisite for testing the web application that's deployed to WebLogic as part of this sample.\n+   - You can skip the Quick Start steps for obtaining a WebLogic image because you will be creating your own Docker image.\n+\n+\n+6. Choose the type of domain you're going to create: `WLS`, `JRF`, or `RestrictedJRF`, and set the environment variable, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, accordingly. The default is `WLS`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   export WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE=<one of WLS, JRF, or RestrictedJRF>\n+   ```\n+\n+7. Set up access to a base image for this sample that will be used as the base image for creating the final image. Do one of the following:\n+\n+   - __Option 1, download an existing WebLogic image.__\n+\n+     Set up access to this sample's base WebLogic image at the [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com):\n+\n+     a. Use a browser to access [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com).\n+\n+     b. Choose an image location:\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF` domains, select `Middleware`, then `fmw-infrastructure`.\n+       - For `WLS` domains, select `Middleware`, then `weblogic`.\n+\n+     c. Select Sign In and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+     d. Use your terminal to locally log in to Docker: `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+\n+     e. Later, when you run the sample, it will call `docker pull` for your base image based on the domain type.\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4`.\n+       - For `WLS`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4`.\n+\n+   - __Option 2, create your own WebLogic base image.__\n+\n+     Alternatively, you can create your own base image and override the sample's default base image name and tag by exporting the `BASE_IMAGE_NAME` and `BASE_IMAGE_TAG` environment variables prior to running the sample scripts. If you want to create your own base image, see [Preparing a Base Image]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-in-image/base-images/_index.md\" >}}).\n+\n+8. If you are using a `JRF` domain type, then it requires an RCU infrastructure database. See [Prerequisites for JRF Domains](#prerequisites-for-jrf-domains). You can do this step before or after you create your final image. If you're not using a `JRF` domain type, proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image).\n+\n+### Prerequisites for JRF domains\n+\n+> __NOTE__: This section is only required for demonstrating a `JRF` domain type. Skip this section and proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image) if your domain type is `WLS` or `RestrictedJRF`.\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database called an RCU database, requires initializing this database, and requires configuring your domain to access this database. All of these steps must occur before you first deploy your domain.\n+\n+Furthermore, if you want to have a restarted JRF domain access updates to the infrastructure database that the domain made at an earlier time, the restarted domain must be supplied a wallet file that was obtained from a previous run of the domain.\n+\n+The following steps demonstrate how to set up an infrastructure database that will work with this sample:\n+\n+  1. [Set up and initialize an RCU database](#set-up-and-initialize-an-rcu-database).\n+  2. [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout).\n+  3. [Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets](#set-up-rcu-model-attributes-domain-resource-attributes-and-secrets).\n+  4. [Reusing or sharing RCU tables](#reusing-or-sharing-rcu-tables).\n+\n+\n+\n+##### Set up and initialize an RCU database\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database and also requires initializing this database with a schema and a set of tables. The following example shows how to set up a sample RCU database and use the RCU tool to create the infrastructure schema for a JRF domain. The RCU database is set up with the following attributes:\n+\n+| Attribute | Value |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| database Kubernetes namespace | `default` |\n+| database Kubernetes pod | `oracle-db` |\n+| database image | `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` |\n+| database password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| infrastructure schema prefix | `FMW1` |\n+| infrastructure schema password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| database URL | `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s` |\n+\n+\n+1. Ensure you have access to the database image, and then deploy it:\n+\n+   - Use a browser to log in to `https://container-registry.oracle.com`, select `database->enterprise` and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+   - Get the database image:\n+     - In the local shell, `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+     - In the local shell, `docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim`.\n+\n+\n+       {{% notice note %}} If a local Docker login and manual pull of `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` is not sufficient (for example, if you are using a remote Kubernetes cluster), then uncomment the `imagePullSecrets` stanza in `$WORKDIR/k8s-db-slim.yaml` and create the image pull secret as follows:\n+\n+              ```\n+              kubectl create secret docker-registry regsecret \\\n+                --docker-server=container-registry.oracle.com \\\n+                --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+                --docker-password=your-password \\\n+                --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+              ```\n+       {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+\n+   - Use the sample script in `$SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service` to create an Oracle database running in the pod, `oracle-db`.\n+\n+      **NOTE**: If your database image access requires the `regsecret` image pull secret that you optionally created above, then pass `-s regsecret` to the `start-db-service.sh` command line.\n+\n+     ```\n+     cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service\n+     start-db-service.sh\n+     ```\n+\n+     This script will deploy a database with the URL, `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`, and administration password, `Oradoc_db1`.\n+\n+     {{% notice warning %}} The Oracle database Docker images are supported only for non-production use. For more details, see My Oracle Support note: Oracle Support for Database Running on Docker (Doc ID 2216342.1) : All the data is gone when the database is restarted.\n+     {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+     **NOTE**: This step is based on the steps documented in [Run a Database](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/userguide/overview/database/).\n+\n+2. Use the sample script in `SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema` to create the RCU schema with the schema prefix `FMW1`.\n+\n+   Note that this script assumes `Oradoc_db1` is the DBA password, `Oradoc_db1` is the schema password, and that the database URL is `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema\n+   ./create-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1 -i container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4\n+   ```\n+\n+   __NOTE__:  If you need to drop the repository, use this command:\n+\n+   ```\n+   drop-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1\n+   ```\n+\n+\n+##### Increase introspection job timeout\n+\n+Because JRF domain home creation takes a considerable amount of time the first time it is created, and because Model in Image creates your domain home for you using the introspection job, you should increase the timeout for the introspection job. Use the `configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds` in `k8s-domain.yaml.template` to override the default with a value of at least 300 seconds (the default is 120 seconds).  \n+\n+##### Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets\n+\n+To allow Model in Image to access the RCU database and OPSS wallet, it's necessary to set up an RCU access secret and an OPSS secret before deploying your domain. It's also necessary to define an `RCUDbInfo` stanza in your model. The sample already sets up all of these for you.  See:\n+\n+| Sample file | Description |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, with `password=welcome1`. |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, with appropriate values for attributes `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string`. |\n+| `model1.yaml.jrf` | Populates the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string` attributes by referencing their locations in the `sample-domain1-rcu-access` secret. The `build.sh` script uses this model instead of `model.yaml.wls` when the source domain type is `JRF`. |\n+| `k8s-domain.yaml.template` | Ensures that the domain mounts the OPSS key secret by setting the domain resource `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` attribute to `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, and ensures the domain mounts the RCU access secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, for reference by WDT model macros by setting the domain resource `configuration.secrets` attribute. Use configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds to increase the timeout value of the introspector job; see [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout). |\n+\n+ **NOTE**: This step is for information purposes only. Do not run the above sample files directly. The sample's main build and run scripts will run them for you.\n+\n+##### Reusing or sharing RCU tables\n+\n+Note that when you succesfully deploy your JRF domain resource for the first time, the introspector job will initialize the RCU tables for the domain using the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza in the WDT model plus the `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` specified in the domain resource. The job will also create a new domain home. Finally, the operator will also capture an OPSS wallet file from the new domain's local directory and place this file in a new Kubernetes config map.\n+\n+There are scenarios when the domain needs to be re-created between updates such as WebLogic credentials are changed, security roles defined in the WDT model have been changed or you want to share the same RCU tables with different domains.  Under these scenarios, the operator needs the `walletPasswordSecret` as well as the OPSS wallet file, together with the exact information in `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` so that the domain can be re-created and access the same set of RCU tables.  Without the wallet file and wallet password, you will not be able to re-create a domain accessing the same set of RCU tables, therefore it is highly recommended to backup the wallet file.\n+\n+To recover a domain's RCU tables between domain restarts or to share an RCU schema between different domains, it is necessary to extract this wallet file from the config map and save the OPSS wallet password secret that was used for the original domain. The wallet password and wallet file are needed again when you recreate the domain or share the database with other domains.\n+\n+To save the wallet file:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -s [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>]\n+```\n+\n+You should back up this file to a safe location that can be retrieved later.\n+\n+To reuse the wallet for subsequent redeployments or share the RCU tables between different domains:\n+\n+1. Store the wallet in a secret:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -r [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>] [-ws <name of the secret. Default DOMAIN_UID-opss-walletfile-secret> ]\n+\n+```\n+\n+2. Modify the domain resource YAML file to provide the secret names:\n+\n+```\n+  configuration:\n+    opss:\n+      # Name of secret with walletPassword for extracting the wallet\n+      walletPasswordSecret: sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret      \n+      # Name of secret with walletFile containing base64 encoded opss wallet\n+      walletFileSecret: sample-domain1-opss-walletfile-secret\n+\n+```\n+\n+See [Reusing an RCU database]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/reusing-rcu.md\" >}}) for instructions.\n+\n+### Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image\n+\n+Model in Image must contain a WebLogic install, a WebLogic Deploy Tool install, and your WDT model files. You can use the sample `./build.sh` script to build this image, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Uses `docker pull` to obtain a base image. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types) to set up access to the base image.)\n+  - Downloads the latest WebLogic Image Tool and WebLogic Deploy Tool to `WORKDIR`.\n+  - Creates and populates a staging directory `$WORKDIR/models` that contains your WDT model files and WDT application archive.\n+    - Builds  a simple servlet application in `$SAMPLEDIR/sample_app` into a WDT model application archive `$WORKDIR/models/archive1.zip`.\n+    - Copies sample model files from `$SAMPLEDIR/model-in-image` to `$WORKDIR/models`. This uses a model file that is appropriate to the domain type (for example, the `JRF` domain model includes database access configuration).\n+  - Uses the WebLogic Image Tool and the `$WORKDIR/models` staging directory to create a final image named `model-in-image:v1` that layers on the base image. Specifically, it runs the WebLogic Image Tool with its `update` option, which:\n+    - Builds the final image as a layer on the base image.\n+    - Puts a WDT install in image location, `/u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy`.\n+    - Copies the WDT model, properties, and application archive from `$WORDKIR/models` to image location, `/u01/wdt/models`.\n+\n+The script expects `JAVA_HOME`, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).)\n+\n+Run the script:\n+\n+  ```\n+  $SAMPLEDIR/build.sh\n+  ```\n+\n+If you intend to use a remote Docker registry, you need to tag and push the image to the remote Docker registry.\n+\n+1.  Tag the image for the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker tag <image-name>:<tag> <region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>:<tag>\n+```\n+\n+2.  Push the image to the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker push <region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>:<tag>\n+```\n+\n+3.

[Reusing or sharing RCU tables](#reusing-or-sharing-rcu-tables).\n+\n+\n+\n+##### Set up and initialize an RCU database\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database and also requires initializing this database with a schema and a set of tables. The following example shows how to set up a sample RCU database and use the RCU tool to create the infrastructure schema for a JRF domain. The RCU database is set up with the following attributes:\n+\n+| Attribute | Value |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| database Kubernetes namespace | `default` |\n+| database Kubernetes pod | `oracle-db` |\n+| database image | `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` |\n+| database password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| infrastructure schema prefix | `FMW1` |\n+| infrastructure schema password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| database URL | `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s` |\n+\n+\n+1. Ensure you have access to the database image, and then deploy it:\n+\n+   - Use a browser to log in to `https://container-registry.oracle.com`, select `database->enterprise` and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+   - Get the database image:\n+     - In the local shell, `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+     - In the local shell, `docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim`.\n+\n+\n+       {{% notice note %}} If a local Docker login and manual pull of `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` is not sufficient (for example, if you are using a remote Kubernetes cluster), then uncomment the `imagePullSecrets` stanza in `$WORKDIR/k8s-db-slim.yaml` and create the image pull secret as follows:\n+\n+              ```\n+              kubectl create secret docker-registry regsecret \\\n+                --docker-server=container-registry.oracle.com \\\n+                --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+                --docker-password=your-password \\\n+                --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+              ```\n+       {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+\n+   - Use the sample script in `$SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service` to create an Oracle database running in the pod, `oracle-db`.\n+\n+      **NOTE**: If your database image access requires the `regsecret` image pull secret that you optionally created above, then pass `-s regsecret` to the `start-db-service.sh` command line.\n+\n+     ```\n+     cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service\n+     start-db-service.sh\n+     ```\n+\n+     This script will deploy a database with the URL, `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`, and administration password, `Oradoc_db1`.\n+\n+     {{% notice warning %}} The Oracle database Docker images are supported only for non-production use. For more details, see My Oracle Support note: Oracle Support for Database Running on Docker (Doc ID 2216342.1) : All the data is gone when the database is restarted.\n+     {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+     **NOTE**: This step is based on the steps documented in [Run a Database](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/userguide/overview/database/).\n+\n+2. Use the sample script in `SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema` to create the RCU schema with the schema prefix `FMW1`.\n+\n+   Note that this script assumes `Oradoc_db1` is the DBA password, `Oradoc_db1` is the schema password, and that the database URL is `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema\n+   ./create-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1 -i container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4\n+   ```\n+\n+   __NOTE__:  If you need to drop the repository, use this command:\n+\n+   ```\n+   drop-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1\n+   ```\n+\n+\n+##### Increase introspection job timeout\n+\n+Because JRF domain home creation takes a considerable amount of time the first time it is created, and because Model in Image creates your domain home for you using the introspection job, you should increase the timeout for the introspection job. Use the `configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds` in `k8s-domain.yaml.template` to override the default with a value of at least 300 seconds (the default is 120 seconds).  \n+\n+##### Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets\n+\n+To allow Model in Image to access the RCU database and OPSS wallet, it's necessary to set up an RCU access secret and an OPSS secret before deploying your domain. It's also necessary to define an `RCUDbInfo` stanza in your model. The sample already sets up all of these for you.  See:\n+\n+| Sample file | Description |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, with `password=welcome1`. |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, with appropriate values for attributes `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string`. |\n+| `model1.yaml.jrf` | Populates the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string` attributes by referencing their locations in the `sample-domain1-rcu-access` secret. The `build.sh` script uses this model instead of `model.yaml.wls` when the source domain type is `JRF`. |\n+| `k8s-domain.yaml.template` | Ensures that the domain mounts the OPSS key secret by setting the domain resource `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` attribute to `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, and ensures the domain mounts the RCU access secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, for reference by WDT model macros by setting the domain resource `configuration.secrets` attribute. Use configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds to increase the timeout value of the introspector job; see [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout). |\n+\n+ **NOTE**: This step is for information purposes only. Do not run the above sample files directly. The sample's main build and run scripts will run them for you.\n+\n+##### Reusing or sharing RCU tables\n+\n+Note that when you succesfully deploy your JRF domain resource for the first time, the introspector job will initialize the RCU tables for the domain using the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza in the WDT model plus the `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` specified in the domain resource. The job will also create a new domain home. Finally, the operator will also capture an OPSS wallet file from the new domain's local directory and place this file in a new Kubernetes config map.\n+\n+There are scenarios when the domain needs to be re-created between updates such as WebLogic credentials are changed, security roles defined in the WDT model have been changed or you want to share the same RCU tables with different domains.  Under these scenarios, the operator needs the `walletPasswordSecret` as well as the OPSS wallet file, together with the exact information in `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` so that the domain can be re-created and access the same set of RCU tables.  Without the wallet file and wallet password, you will not be able to re-create a domain accessing the same set of RCU tables, therefore it is highly recommended to backup the wallet file.\n+\n+To recover a domain's RCU tables between domain restarts or to share an RCU schema between different domains, it is necessary to extract this wallet file from the config map and save the OPSS wallet password secret that was used for the original domain. The wallet password and wallet file are needed again when you recreate the domain or share the database with other domains.\n+\n+To save the wallet file:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -s [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>]\n+```\n+\n+You should back up this file to a safe location that can be retrieved later.\n+\n+To reuse the wallet for subsequent redeployments or share the RCU tables between different domains:\n+\n+1. Store the wallet in a secret:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -r [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>] [-ws <name of the secret. Default DOMAIN_UID-opss-walletfile-secret> ]\n+\n+```\n+\n+2. Modify the domain resource YAML file to provide the secret names:\n+\n+```\n+  configuration:\n+    opss:\n+      # Name of secret with walletPassword for extracting the wallet\n+      walletPasswordSecret: sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret      \n+      # Name of secret with walletFile containing base64 encoded opss wallet\n+      walletFileSecret: sample-domain1-opss-walletfile-secret\n+\n+```\n+\n+See [Reusing an RCU database]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/reusing-rcu.md\" >}}) for instructions.\n+\n+### Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image\n+\n+Model in Image must contain a WebLogic install, a WebLogic Deploy Tool install, and your WDT model files. You can use the sample `./build.sh` script to build this image, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Uses `docker pull` to obtain a base image. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types) to set up access to the base image.)\n+  - Downloads the latest WebLogic Image Tool and WebLogic Deploy Tool to `WORKDIR`.\n+  - Creates and populates a staging directory `$WORKDIR/models` that contains your WDT model files and WDT application archive.\n+    - Builds  a simple servlet application in `$SAMPLEDIR/sample_app` into a WDT model application archive `$WORKDIR/models/archive1.zip`.\n+    - Copies sample model files from `$SAMPLEDIR/model-in-image` to `$WORKDIR/models`. This uses a model file that is appropriate to the domain type (for example, the `JRF` domain model includes database access configuration).\n+  - Uses the WebLogic Image Tool and the `$WORKDIR/models` staging directory to create a final image named `model-in-image:v1` that layers on the base image. Specifically, it runs the WebLogic Image Tool with its `update` option, which:\n+    - Builds the final image as a layer on the base image.\n+    - Puts a WDT install in image location, `/u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy`.\n+    - Copies the WDT model, properties, and application archive from `$WORDKIR/models` to image location, `/u01/wdt/models`.\n+\n+The script expects `JAVA_HOME`, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).)\n+\n+Run the script:\n+\n+  ```\n+  $SAMPLEDIR/build.sh\n+  ```\n+\n+If you intend to use a remote Docker registry, you need to tag and push the image to the remote Docker registry.\n+\n+1.  Tag the image for the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker tag <image-name>:<tag> <region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>:<tag>\n+```\n+\n+2.  Push the image to the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker push <region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>:<tag>\n+```\n+\n+3. Create the pull secret for the remote Docker registry:\n+\n+```\n+ kubectl -n <domain namespace> create secret docker-registry <secret name> \\", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5NTk1MTMyMg=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "81623b1d513bbbfa1f2ca588a8d757daf2e38202"}, "originalPosition": 296}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMjQ1NDIyMDQ3OnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "docs-source/content/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md", "isResolved": true, "comments": {"totalCount": 3, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMy0yMVQwMjowODowMlrOF5m9mw==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMy0yNFQyMjoyNDoyNlrOF7FYPg==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5NTk1MTUxNQ==", "bodyText": "The sample should not be based on OKE it should be based on a generic Kubernetes cluster similar to our other samples", "url": "https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/pull/1478#discussion_r395951515", "createdAt": "2020-03-21T02:08:02Z", "author": {"login": "mriccell"}, "path": "docs-source/content/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,520 @@\n+---\n+title: \"Model in image\"\n+date: 2019-02-23T17:32:31-05:00\n+weight: 4\n+description: \"Sample for supplying a WebLogic Deploy Tool (WDT) model that the operator automatically expands into a full domain home during runtime.\"\n+---\n+\n+### Contents\n+\n+  - [Introduction](#introduction)\n+  - [References](#references)\n+  - [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types)\n+  - [Prerequisites for JRF domains](#prerequisites-for-jrf-domains)\n+    - [Set Up and Initialize an RCU Database](#set-up-and-initialize-an-rcu-database)\n+    - [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout)\n+    - [Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets](#set-up-rcu-model-attributes-domain-resource-attributes-and-secrets)\n+    - [Reusing or sharing RCU tables](#reusing-or-sharing-rcu-tables)\n+  - [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image)\n+  - [Create and deploy your Kubernetes resources](#create-and-deploy-your-kubernetes-resources)\n+  - [Optionally test the sample application](#optionally-test-the-sample-application)\n+  - [Optionally access the WebLogic console](#optionally-access-the-weblogic-console)\n+  - [Cleanup](#cleanup)\n+\n+### Introduction\n+\n+This sample demonstrates:\n+\n+  - Using the WebLogic Image Tool to create a Docker image that contains a WebLogic install, a WebLogic Deploy Tool (WDT) install, a Java EE servlet application contained within a WDT archive, and a WebLogic domain that's defined using a WDT model file.\n+  - Modifying the WDT model that's embedded within the Docker image using a WDT model file that's supplied using a Kubernetes config map.\n+  - Defining a `domainHomeSourceType: FromModel` domain resource that references the WDT model image and the WDT config map.\n+  - Deploying the model image, domain resource, model config map, and associated secrets that define user names, passwords, and URL values for the model and its domain resource.\n+  - Deploying and accessing a Traefik load balancer that redirects HTTP protocol calls to its Java EE servlet application.\n+\n+Supported domain types:\n+\n+There are three types of domains supported by Model in Image: a standard `WLS` domain, an Oracle Fusion Middleware Infrastructure Java Required Files (`JRF`) domain, or a `RestrictedJRF` domain.\n+\n+The `JRF` domain path through the sample includes additional steps for deploying an infrastructure database and initializing the database using the Repository Creation Utility (RCU) tool. `JRF` domains may be  used by Oracle products that layer on top of WebLogic Server such as SOA, OSB, and FA. Similarly, `RestrictedJRF` domains may be used by Oracle layered products such as Oracle Communications products.\n+\n+### References\n+\n+To reference the relevant user documentation, see:\n+ - [Model in Image User Guide]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) user documentation\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Server Deploy Tooling](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling)\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool)\n+\n+\n+\n+### Prerequisites for all domain types\n+\n+1. The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable must be set and must reference a valid JDK8 installation. (`JAVA_HOME` is used by the WebLogic Image Tool.)\n+\n+2. Set a source directory environment variable `SRCDIR` that references the parent of the operator source tree. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   mkdir ~/wlopsrc\n+   cd ~/wlopsrc\n+   git clone https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator.git\n+   export SRCDIR=$(pwd)/weblogic-kubernetes-operator\n+   ```\n+\n+   For additional information about obtaining the operator source, see the [Developer Guide Requirements](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/developerguide/requirements/).\n+\n+3. Create a sample directory environment variable `SAMPLEDIR` that references this sample's directory:\n+\n+   ```\n+   export SAMPLEDIR=${SRCDIR}/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image/\n+   ```\n+\n+4. Create an empty, temporary working directory with 10g of space, and store its location in the `WORKDIR` environment variable. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd <location of empty temporary directory with 10g of space>\n+   export WORKDIR=$(pwd)\n+   ```\n+\n+5. Deploy the operator and set up the operator to manage the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`. Optionally, deploy a Traefik load balancer that manages the same namespace. For example, follow the same steps as the [Quick Start](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/quickstart/), up through the [Prepare for a domain]({{< relref \"/quickstart/prepare.md\" >}}) step.\n+\n+   Note that:\n+   - Deploying the Traefik load balancer is optional, but is a prerequisite for testing the web application that's deployed to WebLogic as part of this sample.\n+   - You can skip the Quick Start steps for obtaining a WebLogic image because you will be creating your own Docker image.\n+\n+\n+6. Choose the type of domain you're going to create: `WLS`, `JRF`, or `RestrictedJRF`, and set the environment variable, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, accordingly. The default is `WLS`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   export WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE=<one of WLS, JRF, or RestrictedJRF>\n+   ```\n+\n+7. Set up access to a base image for this sample that will be used as the base image for creating the final image. Do one of the following:\n+\n+   - __Option 1, download an existing WebLogic image.__\n+\n+     Set up access to this sample's base WebLogic image at the [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com):\n+\n+     a. Use a browser to access [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com).\n+\n+     b. Choose an image location:\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF` domains, select `Middleware`, then `fmw-infrastructure`.\n+       - For `WLS` domains, select `Middleware`, then `weblogic`.\n+\n+     c. Select Sign In and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+     d. Use your terminal to locally log in to Docker: `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+\n+     e. Later, when you run the sample, it will call `docker pull` for your base image based on the domain type.\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4`.\n+       - For `WLS`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4`.\n+\n+   - __Option 2, create your own WebLogic base image.__\n+\n+     Alternatively, you can create your own base image and override the sample's default base image name and tag by exporting the `BASE_IMAGE_NAME` and `BASE_IMAGE_TAG` environment variables prior to running the sample scripts.

Use the `configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds` in `k8s-domain.yaml.template` to override the default with a value of at least 300 seconds (the default is 120 seconds).  \n+\n+##### Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets\n+\n+To allow Model in Image to access the RCU database and OPSS wallet, it's necessary to set up an RCU access secret and an OPSS secret before deploying your domain. It's also necessary to define an `RCUDbInfo` stanza in your model. The sample already sets up all of these for you.  See:\n+\n+| Sample file | Description |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, with `password=welcome1`. |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, with appropriate values for attributes `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string`. |\n+| `model1.yaml.jrf` | Populates the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string` attributes by referencing their locations in the `sample-domain1-rcu-access` secret. The `build.sh` script uses this model instead of `model.yaml.wls` when the source domain type is `JRF`. |\n+| `k8s-domain.yaml.template` | Ensures that the domain mounts the OPSS key secret by setting the domain resource `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` attribute to `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, and ensures the domain mounts the RCU access secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, for reference by WDT model macros by setting the domain resource `configuration.secrets` attribute. Use configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds to increase the timeout value of the introspector job; see [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout). |\n+\n+ **NOTE**: This step is for information purposes only. Do not run the above sample files directly. The sample's main build and run scripts will run them for you.\n+\n+##### Reusing or sharing RCU tables\n+\n+Note that when you succesfully deploy your JRF domain resource for the first time, the introspector job will initialize the RCU tables for the domain using the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza in the WDT model plus the `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` specified in the domain resource. The job will also create a new domain home. Finally, the operator will also capture an OPSS wallet file from the new domain's local directory and place this file in a new Kubernetes config map.\n+\n+There are scenarios when the domain needs to be re-created between updates such as WebLogic credentials are changed, security roles defined in the WDT model have been changed or you want to share the same RCU tables with different domains.  Under these scenarios, the operator needs the `walletPasswordSecret` as well as the OPSS wallet file, together with the exact information in `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` so that the domain can be re-created and access the same set of RCU tables.  Without the wallet file and wallet password, you will not be able to re-create a domain accessing the same set of RCU tables, therefore it is highly recommended to backup the wallet file.\n+\n+To recover a domain's RCU tables between domain restarts or to share an RCU schema between different domains, it is necessary to extract this wallet file from the config map and save the OPSS wallet password secret that was used for the original domain. The wallet password and wallet file are needed again when you recreate the domain or share the database with other domains.\n+\n+To save the wallet file:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -s [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>]\n+```\n+\n+You should back up this file to a safe location that can be retrieved later.\n+\n+To reuse the wallet for subsequent redeployments or share the RCU tables between different domains:\n+\n+1. Store the wallet in a secret:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -r [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>] [-ws <name of the secret. Default DOMAIN_UID-opss-walletfile-secret> ]\n+\n+```\n+\n+2. Modify the domain resource YAML file to provide the secret names:\n+\n+```\n+  configuration:\n+    opss:\n+      # Name of secret with walletPassword for extracting the wallet\n+      walletPasswordSecret: sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret      \n+      # Name of secret with walletFile containing base64 encoded opss wallet\n+      walletFileSecret: sample-domain1-opss-walletfile-secret\n+\n+```\n+\n+See [Reusing an RCU database]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/reusing-rcu.md\" >}}) for instructions.\n+\n+### Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image\n+\n+Model in Image must contain a WebLogic install, a WebLogic Deploy Tool install, and your WDT model files. You can use the sample `./build.sh` script to build this image, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Uses `docker pull` to obtain a base image. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types) to set up access to the base image.)\n+  - Downloads the latest WebLogic Image Tool and WebLogic Deploy Tool to `WORKDIR`.\n+  - Creates and populates a staging directory `$WORKDIR/models` that contains your WDT model files and WDT application archive.\n+    - Builds  a simple servlet application in `$SAMPLEDIR/sample_app` into a WDT model application archive `$WORKDIR/models/archive1.zip`.\n+    - Copies sample model files from `$SAMPLEDIR/model-in-image` to `$WORKDIR/models`. This uses a model file that is appropriate to the domain type (for example, the `JRF` domain model includes database access configuration).\n+  - Uses the WebLogic Image Tool and the `$WORKDIR/models` staging directory to create a final image named `model-in-image:v1` that layers on the base image. Specifically, it runs the WebLogic Image Tool with its `update` option, which:\n+    - Builds the final image as a layer on the base image.\n+    - Puts a WDT install in image location, `/u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy`.\n+    - Copies the WDT model, properties, and application archive from `$WORDKIR/models` to image location, `/u01/wdt/models`.\n+\n+The script expects `JAVA_HOME`, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).)\n+\n+Run the script:\n+\n+  ```\n+  $SAMPLEDIR/build.sh\n+  ```\n+\n+If you intend to use a remote Docker registry, you need to tag and push the image to the remote Docker registry.\n+\n+1.  Tag the image for the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker tag <image-name>:<tag> <region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>:<tag>\n+```\n+\n+2.  Push the image to the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker push <region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>:<tag>\n+```\n+\n+3. Create the pull secret for the remote Docker registry:\n+\n+```\n+ kubectl -n <domain namespace> create secret docker-registry <secret name> \\\n+     --docker-server=<region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name> \\\n+     --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+     --docker-password=your-password \\\n+     --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+\n+```\n+\n+4. Update the domain template file `$SAMPLEDIR/k8s-domain.yaml.template` to provide the `imagePullSecrets`:\n+\n+```\n+  imagePullSecrets:\n+  - name: <secret name>\n+\n+```\n+\n+5.

Similarly, `RestrictedJRF` domains may be used by Oracle layered products such as Oracle Communications products.\n+\n+### References\n+\n+To reference the relevant user documentation, see:\n+ - [Model in Image User Guide]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) user documentation\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Server Deploy Tooling](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling)\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool)\n+\n+\n+\n+### Prerequisites for all domain types\n+\n+1. The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable must be set and must reference a valid JDK8 installation. (`JAVA_HOME` is used by the WebLogic Image Tool.)\n+\n+2. Set a source directory environment variable `SRCDIR` that references the parent of the operator source tree. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   mkdir ~/wlopsrc\n+   cd ~/wlopsrc\n+   git clone https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator.git\n+   export SRCDIR=$(pwd)/weblogic-kubernetes-operator\n+   ```\n+\n+   For additional information about obtaining the operator source, see the [Developer Guide Requirements](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/developerguide/requirements/).\n+\n+3. Create a sample directory environment variable `SAMPLEDIR` that references this sample's directory:\n+\n+   ```\n+   export SAMPLEDIR=${SRCDIR}/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image/\n+   ```\n+\n+4. Create an empty, temporary working directory with 10g of space, and store its location in the `WORKDIR` environment variable. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd <location of empty temporary directory with 10g of space>\n+   export WORKDIR=$(pwd)\n+   ```\n+\n+5. Deploy the operator and set up the operator to manage the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`. Optionally, deploy a Traefik load balancer that manages the same namespace. For example, follow the same steps as the [Quick Start](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/quickstart/), up through the [Prepare for a domain]({{< relref \"/quickstart/prepare.md\" >}}) step.\n+\n+   Note that:\n+   - Deploying the Traefik load balancer is optional, but is a prerequisite for testing the web application that's deployed to WebLogic as part of this sample.\n+   - You can skip the Quick Start steps for obtaining a WebLogic image because you will be creating your own Docker image.\n+\n+\n+6. Choose the type of domain you're going to create: `WLS`, `JRF`, or `RestrictedJRF`, and set the environment variable, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, accordingly. The default is `WLS`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   export WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE=<one of WLS, JRF, or RestrictedJRF>\n+   ```\n+\n+7. Set up access to a base image for this sample that will be used as the base image for creating the final image. Do one of the following:\n+\n+   - __Option 1, download an existing WebLogic image.__\n+\n+     Set up access to this sample's base WebLogic image at the [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com):\n+\n+     a. Use a browser to access [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com).\n+\n+     b. Choose an image location:\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF` domains, select `Middleware`, then `fmw-infrastructure`.\n+       - For `WLS` domains, select `Middleware`, then `weblogic`.\n+\n+     c. Select Sign In and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+     d. Use your terminal to locally log in to Docker: `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+\n+     e. Later, when you run the sample, it will call `docker pull` for your base image based on the domain type.\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4`.\n+       - For `WLS`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4`.\n+\n+   - __Option 2, create your own WebLogic base image.__\n+\n+     Alternatively, you can create your own base image and override the sample's default base image name and tag by exporting the `BASE_IMAGE_NAME` and `BASE_IMAGE_TAG` environment variables prior to running the sample scripts. If you want to create your own base image, see [Preparing a Base Image]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-in-image/base-images/_index.md\" >}}).\n+\n+8. If you are using a `JRF` domain type, then it requires an RCU infrastructure database. See [Prerequisites for JRF Domains](#prerequisites-for-jrf-domains). You can do this step before or after you create your final image. If you're not using a `JRF` domain type, proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image).\n+\n+### Prerequisites for JRF domains\n+\n+> __NOTE__: This section is only required for demonstrating a `JRF` domain type. Skip this section and proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image) if your domain type is `WLS` or `RestrictedJRF`.\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database called an RCU database, requires initializing this database, and requires configuring your domain to access this database. All of these steps must occur before you first deploy your domain.\n+\n+Furthermore, if you want to have a restarted JRF domain access updates to the infrastructure database that the domain made at an earlier time, the restarted domain must be supplied a wallet file that was obtained from a previous run of the domain.\n+\n+The following steps demonstrate how to set up an infrastructure database that will work with this sample:\n+\n+  1. [Set up and initialize an RCU database](#set-up-and-initialize-an-rcu-database).\n+  2. [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout).\n+  3. [Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets](#set-up-rcu-model-attributes-domain-resource-attributes-and-secrets).\n+  4. [Reusing or sharing RCU tables](#reusing-or-sharing-rcu-tables).\n+\n+\n+\n+##### Set up and initialize an RCU database\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database and also requires initializing this database with a schema and a set of tables. The following example shows how to set up a sample RCU database and use the RCU tool to create the infrastructure schema for a JRF domain. The RCU database is set up with the following attributes:\n+\n+| Attribute | Value |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| database Kubernetes namespace | `default` |\n+| database Kubernetes pod | `oracle-db` |\n+| database image | `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` |\n+| database password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| infrastructure schema prefix | `FMW1` |\n+| infrastructure schema password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| database URL | `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s` |\n+\n+\n+1. Ensure you have access to the database image, and then deploy it:\n+\n+   - Use a browser to log in to `https://container-registry.oracle.com`, select `database->enterprise` and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+   - Get the database image:\n+     - In the local shell, `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+     - In the local shell, `docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim`.\n+\n+\n+       {{% notice note %}} If a local Docker login and manual pull of `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` is not sufficient (for example, if you are using a remote Kubernetes cluster), then uncomment the `imagePullSecrets` stanza in `$WORKDIR/k8s-db-slim.yaml` and create the image pull secret as follows:\n+\n+              ```\n+              kubectl create secret docker-registry regsecret \\\n+                --docker-server=container-registry.oracle.com \\\n+                --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+                --docker-password=your-password \\\n+                --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+              ```\n+       {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+\n+   - Use the sample script in `$SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service` to create an Oracle database running in the pod, `oracle-db`.\n+\n+      **NOTE**: If your database image access requires the `regsecret` image pull secret that you optionally created above, then pass `-s regsecret` to the `start-db-service.sh` command line.\n+\n+     ```\n+     cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service\n+     start-db-service.sh\n+     ```\n+\n+     This script will deploy a database with the URL, `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`, and administration password, `Oradoc_db1`.\n+\n+     {{% notice warning %}} The Oracle database Docker images are supported only for non-production use.

The wallet password and wallet file are needed again when you recreate the domain or share the database with other domains.\n+\n+To save the wallet file:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -s [-wf <name of the wallet file.

You can use the sample `./build.sh` script to build this image, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Uses `docker pull` to obtain a base image. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types) to set up access to the base image.)\n+  - Downloads the latest WebLogic Image Tool and WebLogic Deploy Tool to `WORKDIR`.\n+  - Creates and populates a staging directory `$WORKDIR/models` that contains your WDT model files and WDT application archive.\n+    - Builds  a simple servlet application in `$SAMPLEDIR/sample_app` into a WDT model application archive `$WORKDIR/models/archive1.zip`.\n+    - Copies sample model files from `$SAMPLEDIR/model-in-image` to `$WORKDIR/models`. This uses a model file that is appropriate to the domain type (for example, the `JRF` domain model includes database access configuration).\n+  - Uses the WebLogic Image Tool and the `$WORKDIR/models` staging directory to create a final image named `model-in-image:v1` that layers on the base image. Specifically, it runs the WebLogic Image Tool with its `update` option, which:\n+    - Builds the final image as a layer on the base image.\n+    - Puts a WDT install in image location, `/u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy`.\n+    - Copies the WDT model, properties, and application archive from `$WORDKIR/models` to image location, `/u01/wdt/models`.\n+\n+The script expects `JAVA_HOME`, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized.

Similarly, `RestrictedJRF` domains may be used by Oracle layered products such as Oracle Communications products.\n+\n+### References\n+\n+To reference the relevant user documentation, see:\n+ - [Model in Image User Guide]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) user documentation\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Server Deploy Tooling](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling)\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool)\n+\n+\n+\n+### Prerequisites for all domain types\n+\n+1. The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable must be set and must reference a valid JDK8 installation. (`JAVA_HOME` is used by the WebLogic Image Tool.)\n+\n+2. Set a source directory environment variable `SRCDIR` that references the parent of the operator source tree. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   mkdir ~/wlopsrc\n+   cd ~/wlopsrc\n+   git clone https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator.git\n+   export SRCDIR=$(pwd)/weblogic-kubernetes-operator\n+   ```\n+\n+   For additional information about obtaining the operator source, see the [Developer Guide Requirements](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/developerguide/requirements/).\n+\n+3. Create a sample directory environment variable `SAMPLEDIR` that references this sample's directory:\n+\n+   ```\n+   export SAMPLEDIR=${SRCDIR}/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image/\n+   ```\n+\n+4. Create an empty, temporary working directory with 10g of space, and store its location in the `WORKDIR` environment variable. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd <location of empty temporary directory with 10g of space>\n+   export WORKDIR=$(pwd)\n+   ```\n+\n+5. Deploy the operator and set up the operator to manage the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`. Optionally, deploy a Traefik load balancer that manages the same namespace. For example, follow the same steps as the [Quick Start](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/quickstart/), up through the [Prepare for a domain]({{< relref \"/quickstart/prepare.md\" >}}) step.\n+\n+   Note that:\n+   - Deploying the Traefik load balancer is optional, but is a prerequisite for testing the web application that's deployed to WebLogic as part of this sample.\n+   - You can skip the Quick Start steps for obtaining a WebLogic image because you will be creating your own Docker image.\n+\n+\n+6. Choose the type of domain you're going to create: `WLS`, `JRF`, or `RestrictedJRF`, and set the environment variable, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, accordingly. The default is `WLS`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   export WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE=<one of WLS, JRF, or RestrictedJRF>\n+   ```\n+\n+7. Set up access to a base image for this sample that will be used as the base image for creating the final image. Do one of the following:\n+\n+   - __Option 1, download an existing WebLogic image.__\n+\n+     Set up access to this sample's base WebLogic image at the [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com):\n+\n+     a. Use a browser to access [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com).\n+\n+     b. Choose an image location:\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF` domains, select `Middleware`, then `fmw-infrastructure`.\n+       - For `WLS` domains, select `Middleware`, then `weblogic`.\n+\n+     c. Select Sign In and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+     d. Use your terminal to locally log in to Docker: `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+\n+     e. Later, when you run the sample, it will call `docker pull` for your base image based on the domain type.\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4`.\n+       - For `WLS`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4`.\n+\n+   - __Option 2, create your own WebLogic base image.__\n+\n+     Alternatively, you can create your own base image and override the sample's default base image name and tag by exporting the `BASE_IMAGE_NAME` and `BASE_IMAGE_TAG` environment variables prior to running the sample scripts. If you want to create your own base image, see [Preparing a Base Image]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-in-image/base-images/_index.md\" >}}).\n+\n+8. If you are using a `JRF` domain type, then it requires an RCU infrastructure database. See [Prerequisites for JRF Domains](#prerequisites-for-jrf-domains). You can do this step before or after you create your final image. If you're not using a `JRF` domain type, proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image).\n+\n+### Prerequisites for JRF domains\n+\n+> __NOTE__: This section is only required for demonstrating a `JRF` domain type. Skip this section and proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image) if your domain type is `WLS` or `RestrictedJRF`.\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database called an RCU database, requires initializing this database, and requires configuring your domain to access this database. All of these steps must occur before you first deploy your domain.\n+\n+Furthermore, if you want to have a restarted JRF domain access updates to the infrastructure database that the domain made at an earlier time, the restarted domain must be supplied a wallet file that was obtained from a previous run of the domain.\n+\n+The following steps demonstrate how to set up an infrastructure database that will work with this sample:\n+\n+  1. [Set up and initialize an RCU database](#set-up-and-initialize-an-rcu-database).\n+  2. [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout).\n+  3. [Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets](#set-up-rcu-model-attributes-domain-resource-attributes-and-secrets).\n+  4. [Reusing or sharing RCU tables](#reusing-or-sharing-rcu-tables).\n+\n+\n+\n+##### Set up and initialize an RCU database\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database and also requires initializing this database with a schema and a set of tables. The following example shows how to set up a sample RCU database and use the RCU tool to create the infrastructure schema for a JRF domain. The RCU database is set up with the following attributes:\n+\n+| Attribute | Value |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| database Kubernetes namespace | `default` |\n+| database Kubernetes pod | `oracle-db` |\n+| database image | `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` |\n+| database password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| infrastructure schema prefix | `FMW1` |\n+| infrastructure schema password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| database URL | `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s` |\n+\n+\n+1. Ensure you have access to the database image, and then deploy it:\n+\n+   - Use a browser to log in to `https://container-registry.oracle.com`, select `database->enterprise` and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+   - Get the database image:\n+     - In the local shell, `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+     - In the local shell, `docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim`.\n+\n+\n+       {{% notice note %}} If a local Docker login and manual pull of `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` is not sufficient (for example, if you are using a remote Kubernetes cluster), then uncomment the `imagePullSecrets` stanza in `$WORKDIR/k8s-db-slim.yaml` and create the image pull secret as follows:\n+\n+              ```\n+              kubectl create secret docker-registry regsecret \\\n+                --docker-server=container-registry.oracle.com \\\n+                --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+                --docker-password=your-password \\\n+                --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+              ```\n+       {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+\n+   - Use the sample script in `$SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service` to create an Oracle database running in the pod, `oracle-db`.\n+\n+      **NOTE**: If your database image access requires the `regsecret` image pull secret that you optionally created above, then pass `-s regsecret` to the `start-db-service.sh` command line.\n+\n+     ```\n+     cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service\n+     start-db-service.sh\n+     ```\n+\n+     This script will deploy a database with the URL, `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`, and administration password, `Oradoc_db1`.\n+\n+     {{% notice warning %}} The Oracle database Docker images are supported only for non-production use. For more details, see My Oracle Support note: Oracle Support for Database Running on Docker (Doc ID 2216342.1) : All the data is gone when the database is restarted.\n+     {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+     **NOTE**: This step is based on the steps documented in [Run a Database](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/userguide/overview/database/).\n+\n+2. Use the sample script in `SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema` to create the RCU schema with the schema prefix `FMW1`.\n+\n+   Note that this script assumes `Oradoc_db1` is the DBA password, `Oradoc_db1` is the schema password, and that the database URL is `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema\n+   ./create-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1 -i container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4\n+   ```\n+\n+   __NOTE__:  If you need to drop the repository, use this command:\n+\n+   ```\n+   drop-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1\n+   ```\n+\n+\n+##### Increase introspection job timeout\n+\n+Because JRF domain home creation takes a considerable amount of time the first time it is created, and because Model in Image creates your domain home for you using the introspection job, you should increase the timeout for the introspection job. Use the `configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds` in `k8s-domain.yaml.template` to override the default with a value of at least 300 seconds (the default is 120 seconds).  \n+\n+##### Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets\n+\n+To allow Model in Image to access the RCU database and OPSS wallet, it's necessary to set up an RCU access secret and an OPSS secret before deploying your domain. It's also necessary to define an `RCUDbInfo` stanza in your model. The sample already sets up all of these for you.  See:\n+\n+| Sample file | Description |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, with `password=welcome1`. |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, with appropriate values for attributes `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string`. |\n+| `model1.yaml.jrf` | Populates the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string` attributes by referencing their locations in the `sample-domain1-rcu-access` secret. The `build.sh` script uses this model instead of `model.yaml.wls` when the source domain type is `JRF`. |\n+| `k8s-domain.yaml.template` | Ensures that the domain mounts the OPSS key secret by setting the domain resource `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` attribute to `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, and ensures the domain mounts the RCU access secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, for reference by WDT model macros by setting the domain resource `configuration.secrets` attribute. Use configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds to increase the timeout value of the introspector job; see [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout). |\n+\n+ **NOTE**: This step is for information purposes only. Do not run the above sample files directly. The sample's main build and run scripts will run them for you.\n+\n+##### Reusing or sharing RCU tables\n+\n+Note that when you succesfully deploy your JRF domain resource for the first time, the introspector job will initialize the RCU tables for the domain using the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza in the WDT model plus the `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` specified in the domain resource. The job will also create a new domain home. Finally, the operator will also capture an OPSS wallet file from the new domain's local directory and place this file in a new Kubernetes config map.\n+\n+There are scenarios when the domain needs to be re-created between updates such as WebLogic credentials are changed, security roles defined in the WDT model have been changed or you want to share the same RCU tables with different domains.  Under these scenarios, the operator needs the `walletPasswordSecret` as well as the OPSS wallet file, together with the exact information in `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` so that the domain can be re-created and access the same set of RCU tables.  Without the wallet file and wallet password, you will not be able to re-create a domain accessing the same set of RCU tables, therefore it is highly recommended to backup the wallet file.\n+\n+To recover a domain's RCU tables between domain restarts or to share an RCU schema between different domains, it is necessary to extract this wallet file from the config map and save the OPSS wallet password secret that was used for the original domain. The wallet password and wallet file are needed again when you recreate the domain or share the database with other domains.\n+\n+To save the wallet file:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -s [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>]\n+```\n+\n+You should back up this file to a safe location that can be retrieved later.\n+\n+To reuse the wallet for subsequent redeployments or share the RCU tables between different domains:\n+\n+1. Store the wallet in a secret:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -r [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>] [-ws <name of the secret. Default DOMAIN_UID-opss-walletfile-secret> ]\n+\n+```\n+\n+2. Modify the domain resource YAML file to provide the secret names:\n+\n+```\n+  configuration:\n+    opss:\n+      # Name of secret with walletPassword for extracting the wallet\n+      walletPasswordSecret: sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret      \n+      # Name of secret with walletFile containing base64 encoded opss wallet\n+      walletFileSecret: sample-domain1-opss-walletfile-secret\n+\n+```\n+\n+See [Reusing an RCU database]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/reusing-rcu.md\" >}}) for instructions.\n+\n+### Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image\n+\n+Model in Image must contain a WebLogic install, a WebLogic Deploy Tool install, and your WDT model files.

This is because the domain home is stored in an image directory which will not survive the restart of the owning pod.\n+\n+_How do Model in Image updates work during runtime?_\n+\n+After you make a change to your domain resource `restartVersion` or `image` attribute, the operator will rerun the domain's introspector job. This job will reload all of your secrets and environment variables, merge all of your model files, and generate a new domain home. If the job succeeds, then the operator will make the updated domain home available to pods using a config map named `DOMAIN_UID-weblogic-domain-introspect-cm`. Finally, the operator will subsequently roll (restart) each running WebLogic Server pod in the domain so that it can load the new configuration. A domain roll begins by restarting the domain's Administration Server and then proceeds to restart each Manager Server in the domain.\n+\n+_Can we use custom configuration overrides to do the updates instead?_\n+\n+No. Custom configuration overrides, which are WebLogic configuration overrides specified using a domain resource `configuration.overridesConfigMap`, as described in [Configuration overrides]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/configoverrides/_index.md\" >}}), aren't supported in combination with Model in Image. Model in Image will generate an error if custom overrides are specified. This should not be a concern because model file, secret, and/or model image updates are simpler and more flexible than custom configuration override updates. Unlike configuration overrides, the syntax for a model file update exactly matches the syntax for specifying your model file in the first place.\n+\n+\n+#### Supported and unsupported updates\n+\n+ - You can add new MBeans or resources simply by specifying their corresponding model file YAML snippet along with their parent bean hierarchy. See [Example of adding a data source](#example-of-adding-a-datasource).\n+\n+ - You can recreate, change, or add secrets that your model depends on. For example, you can change a database password secret.\n+\n+ - You can change or add environment variables that your model macros may depend on (macros that use the `@@ENV:myenvvar@@` syntax).\n+\n+ - You can remove a named MBean or resource by specifying a model file with a `!` symbol just before the bean or resource name. For example, if you have a data source named `mynewdatasource` defined in your model, it can be removed by specifying a small model file that loads after the model file that defines the data source, where the small model file looks like this:\n+\n+  ```\n+  resources:\n+    JDBCSystemResource:\n+      !mynewdatasource:\n+  ```\n+\n+  For more information, see [Declaring Named MBeans to Delete](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling#declaring-named-mbeans-to-delete) in the WebLogic Deploying Tooling documentation.\n+\n+ - You can add or alter an MBean attribute by specifying a YAML snippet along with its parent bean hierarchy that references an existing MBean and the attribute. For example, to add or alter the max capacity of a data source named `mynewdatasource`:\n+\n+  ```\n+  resources:\n+    JDBCSystemResource:\n+      mynewdatasource:\n+        JdbcResource:\n+          JDBCConnectionPoolParams:\n+            MaxCapacity: 5\n+  ```\n+\n+  For more information, see [Using Multiple Models](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling#using-multiple-models) in the WebLogic Deploy Tooling documentation.\n+\n+ - There is no way to directly delete an attribute from an MBean that's already been specified by a model file. The work-around is to do this using two model files: (a) add a model file that deletes the named bean/resource that is a parent to the attribute you want to delete, and (b) add another  subsequent model file that fully defines the named bean/resource but without the attribute you want to delete.\n+\n+ - The following runtime updates haven't been tested and are _not_ supported in the first release of Model in Image. If you need to make these kinds of updates, consider shutting down your domain entirely before making the change:\n+   - Adding, removing, or altering the network configuration of an existing Managed Server. This includes, but isn't limited to network channels, ports, and cluster addresses.\n+   - Adding a Managed Server to an existing configured cluster.\n+   - Altering the `cluster-size` or `max-cluster-size` of an existing dynamic cluster.\n+   - TBD This needs some research. Check with QA, etc.\n+\n+#### Changing a domain resource 'restartVersion'\n+\n+As was mentioned in the [overview](#overview), one way to tell the operator to apply your configuration changes to a running domain is by altering the domain resource `restartVersion`. Here are some common ways to do this:\n+\n+ - You can alter `restartVersion` interactively using `kubectl edit -n MY_NAMESPACE domain MY_DOMAINUID`.\n+\n+ - If you have your domain's resource file, then you can alter this file and call `kubectl apply -f` on the file.\n+\n+ - You can use the Kubernetes `get` and `patch` commands. Here's a sample automation script:\n+\n+   ```\n+   #!/bin/bash\n+   NAMESPACE=${1:-sample-domain1-ns}\n+   DOMAINUID=${2:-sample-domain1}\n+   currentRV=$(kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} get domain ${DOMAINUID} -o=jsonpath='{.spec.restartVersion}')\n+   if [ $? = 0 ]; then\n+     # we enter here only if the previous command succeeded\n+\n+     nextRV=$((currentRV + 1))\n+\n+     echo \"@@ Info: Rolling domain '${DOMAINUID}' in namespace '${NAMESPACE}' from restartVersion='${currentRV}' to restartVersion='${nextRV}'.\"\n+\n+     kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} patch domain ${DOMAINUID} --type='json' \\\n+       -p='[{\"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/spec/restartVersion\", \"value\": \"'${nextRV}'\" }]'\n+   fi\n+   ```\n+\n+#### Using the WDT Discover Domain Tool", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "f7a1c52c69582021aa843a9dd5fd64090be18f46"}, "originalPosition": 128}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5NjcwODA0Mw==", "bodyText": "Okay, now I understand your earlier comment, @mriccell.

This is because the domain home is stored in an image directory which will not survive the restart of the owning pod.\n+\n+_How do Model in Image updates work during runtime?_\n+\n+After you make a change to your domain resource `restartVersion` or `image` attribute, the operator will rerun the domain's introspector job. This job will reload all of your secrets and environment variables, merge all of your model files, and generate a new domain home. If the job succeeds, then the operator will make the updated domain home available to pods using a config map named `DOMAIN_UID-weblogic-domain-introspect-cm`. Finally, the operator will subsequently roll (restart) each running WebLogic Server pod in the domain so that it can load the new configuration. A domain roll begins by restarting the domain's Administration Server and then proceeds to restart each Manager Server in the domain.\n+\n+_Can we use custom configuration overrides to do the updates instead?_\n+\n+No. Custom configuration overrides, which are WebLogic configuration overrides specified using a domain resource `configuration.overridesConfigMap`, as described in [Configuration overrides]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/configoverrides/_index.md\" >}}), aren't supported in combination with Model in Image. Model in Image will generate an error if custom overrides are specified. This should not be a concern because model file, secret, and/or model image updates are simpler and more flexible than custom configuration override updates. Unlike configuration overrides, the syntax for a model file update exactly matches the syntax for specifying your model file in the first place.\n+\n+\n+#### Supported and unsupported updates\n+\n+ - You can add new MBeans or resources simply by specifying their corresponding model file YAML snippet along with their parent bean hierarchy. See [Example of adding a data source](#example-of-adding-a-datasource).\n+\n+ - You can recreate, change, or add secrets that your model depends on. For example, you can change a database password secret.\n+\n+ - You can change or add environment variables that your model macros may depend on (macros that use the `@@ENV:myenvvar@@` syntax).\n+\n+ - You can remove a named MBean or resource by specifying a model file with a `!` symbol just before the bean or resource name. For example, if you have a data source named `mynewdatasource` defined in your model, it can be removed by specifying a small model file that loads after the model file that defines the data source, where the small model file looks like this:\n+\n+  ```\n+  resources:\n+    JDBCSystemResource:\n+      !mynewdatasource:\n+  ```\n+\n+  For more information, see [Declaring Named MBeans to Delete](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling#declaring-named-mbeans-to-delete) in the WebLogic Deploying Tooling documentation.\n+\n+ - You can add or alter an MBean attribute by specifying a YAML snippet along with its parent bean hierarchy that references an existing MBean and the attribute. For example, to add or alter the max capacity of a data source named `mynewdatasource`:\n+\n+  ```\n+  resources:\n+    JDBCSystemResource:\n+      mynewdatasource:\n+        JdbcResource:\n+          JDBCConnectionPoolParams:\n+            MaxCapacity: 5\n+  ```\n+\n+  For more information, see [Using Multiple Models](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling#using-multiple-models) in the WebLogic Deploy Tooling documentation.\n+\n+ - There is no way to directly delete an attribute from an MBean that's already been specified by a model file. The work-around is to do this using two model files: (a) add a model file that deletes the named bean/resource that is a parent to the attribute you want to delete, and (b) add another  subsequent model file that fully defines the named bean/resource but without the attribute you want to delete.\n+\n+ - The following runtime updates haven't been tested and are _not_ supported in the first release of Model in Image. If you need to make these kinds of updates, consider shutting down your domain entirely before making the change:\n+   - Adding, removing, or altering the network configuration of an existing Managed Server.

If the job succeeds, then the operator will make the updated domain home available to pods using a config map named `DOMAIN_UID-weblogic-domain-introspect-cm`. Finally, the operator will subsequently roll (restart) each running WebLogic Server pod in the domain so that it can load the new configuration. A domain roll begins by restarting the domain's Administration Server and then proceeds to restart each Manager Server in the domain.\n+\n+_Can we use custom configuration overrides to do the updates instead?_\n+\n+No. Custom configuration overrides, which are WebLogic configuration overrides specified using a domain resource `configuration.overridesConfigMap`, as described in [Configuration overrides]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/configoverrides/_index.md\" >}}), aren't supported in combination with Model in Image. Model in Image will generate an error if custom overrides are specified.

For example, you can change a database password secret.\n+\n+ - You can change or add environment variables that your model macros may depend on (macros that use the `@@ENV:myenvvar@@` syntax).\n+\n+ - You can remove a named MBean or resource by specifying a model file with a `!` symbol just before the bean or resource name. For example, if you have a data source named `mynewdatasource` defined in your model, it can be removed by specifying a small model file that loads after the model file that defines the data source, where the small model file looks like this:\n+\n+  ```\n+  resources:\n+    JDBCSystemResource:\n+      !mynewdatasource:\n+  ```\n+\n+  For more information, see [Declaring Named MBeans to Delete](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling#declaring-named-mbeans-to-delete) in the WebLogic Deploying Tooling documentation.\n+\n+ - You can add or alter an MBean attribute by specifying a YAML snippet along with its parent bean hierarchy that references an existing MBean and the attribute.

The work-around is to do this using two model files: (a) add a model file that deletes the named bean/resource that is a parent to the attribute you want to delete, and (b) add another  subsequent model file that fully defines the named bean/resource but without the attribute you want to delete.\n+\n+ - The following runtime updates haven't been tested and are _not_ supported in the first release of Model in Image.

See [Using the WDT Discover Domain Tool](#using-the-wdt-discover-tool).\n+\n+ - For simple ways to change `restartVersion`, see [Changing a domain resource 'restartVersion'](#changing-a-domain-resource-restartversion).\n+\n+ - For a sample of adding a data source to a running domain, see [Example of adding a data source](#example-of-adding-a-data-source).\n+\n+ - For a discussion of model file syntax, see the [WebLogic Deploy Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling) documentation and [Model files]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md\" >}}).\n+\n+ - If the introspector job reports a failure, see [Debugging]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/debugging.md\" >}}) for debugging advice.\n+\n+#### Frequently asked questions\n+\n+_Why is it necessary to specify updates using model files?_\n+\n+Similar to Domain in Image, if you make a direct runtime WebLogic configuration update of a Model in Image domain using the WebLogic console or WLST scripts, then the update is ephemeral. This is because the domain home is stored in an image directory which will not survive the restart of the owning pod.\n+\n+_How do Model in Image updates work during runtime?_\n+\n+After you make a change to your domain resource `restartVersion` or `image` attribute, the operator will rerun the domain's introspector job. This job will reload all of your secrets and environment variables, merge all of your model files, and generate a new domain home. If the job succeeds, then the operator will make the updated domain home available to pods using a config map named `DOMAIN_UID-weblogic-domain-introspect-cm`. Finally, the operator will subsequently roll (restart) each running WebLogic Server pod in the domain so that it can load the new configuration. A domain roll begins by restarting the domain's Administration Server and then proceeds to restart each Manager Server in the domain.\n+\n+_Can we use custom configuration overrides to do the updates instead?_\n+\n+No. Custom configuration overrides, which are WebLogic configuration overrides specified using a domain resource `configuration.overridesConfigMap`, as described in [Configuration overrides]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/configoverrides/_index.md\" >}}), aren't supported in combination with Model in Image. Model in Image will generate an error if custom overrides are specified. This should not be a concern because model file, secret, and/or model image updates are simpler and more flexible than custom configuration override updates. Unlike configuration overrides, the syntax for a model file update exactly matches the syntax for specifying your model file in the first place.\n+\n+\n+#### Supported and unsupported updates\n+\n+ - You can add new MBeans or resources simply by specifying their corresponding model file YAML snippet along with their parent bean hierarchy. See [Example of adding a data source](#example-of-adding-a-datasource).\n+\n+ - You can recreate, change, or add secrets that your model depends on. For example, you can change a database password secret.\n+\n+ - You can change or add environment variables that your model macros may depend on (macros that use the `@@ENV:myenvvar@@` syntax).\n+\n+ - You can remove a named MBean or resource by specifying a model file with a `!` symbol just before the bean or resource name. For example, if you have a data source named `mynewdatasource` defined in your model, it can be removed by specifying a small model file that loads after the model file that defines the data source, where the small model file looks like this:\n+\n+  ```\n+  resources:\n+    JDBCSystemResource:\n+      !mynewdatasource:\n+  ```\n+\n+  For more information, see [Declaring Named MBeans to Delete](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling#declaring-named-mbeans-to-delete) in the WebLogic Deploying Tooling documentation.\n+\n+ - You can add or alter an MBean attribute by specifying a YAML snippet along with its parent bean hierarchy that references an existing MBean and the attribute. For example, to add or alter the max capacity of a data source named `mynewdatasource`:\n+\n+  ```\n+  resources:\n+    JDBCSystemResource:\n+      mynewdatasource:\n+        JdbcResource:\n+          JDBCConnectionPoolParams:\n+            MaxCapacity: 5\n+  ```\n+\n+  For more information, see [Using Multiple Models](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling#using-multiple-models) in the WebLogic Deploy Tooling documentation.\n+\n+ - There is no way to directly delete an attribute from an MBean that's already been specified by a model file.

If you are using a `JRF` domain type, then it requires an RCU infrastructure database. See [Prerequisites for JRF Domains](#prerequisites-for-jrf-domains). You can do this step before or after you create your final image. If you're not using a `JRF` domain type, proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image).\n+\n+### Prerequisites for JRF domains\n+\n+> __NOTE__: This section is only required for demonstrating a `JRF` domain type. Skip this section and proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image) if your domain type is `WLS` or `RestrictedJRF`.\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database called an RCU database, requires initializing this database, and requires configuring your domain to access this database. All of these steps must occur before you first deploy your domain.\n+\n+Furthermore, if you want to have a restarted JRF domain access updates to the infrastructure database that the domain made at an earlier time, the restarted domain must be supplied a wallet file that was obtained from a previous run of the domain.\n+\n+The following steps demonstrate how to set up an infrastructure database that will work with this sample:\n+\n+  1. [Set up and initialize an RCU database](#set-up-and-initialize-an-rcu-database).\n+  2. [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout).\n+  3. [Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets](#set-up-rcu-model-attributes-domain-resource-attributes-and-secrets).\n+  4. [Reusing or sharing RCU tables](#reusing-or-sharing-rcu-tables).\n+\n+\n+\n+##### Set up and initialize an RCU database\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database and also requires initializing this database with a schema and a set of tables. The following example shows how to set up a sample RCU database and use the RCU tool to create the infrastructure schema for a JRF domain. The RCU database is set up with the following attributes:\n+\n+| Attribute | Value |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| database Kubernetes namespace | `default` |\n+| database Kubernetes pod | `oracle-db` |\n+| database image | `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` |\n+| database password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| infrastructure schema prefix | `FMW1` |\n+| infrastructure schema password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| database URL | `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s` |\n+\n+\n+1. Ensure you have access to the database image, and then deploy it:\n+\n+   - Use a browser to log in to `https://container-registry.oracle.com`, select `database->enterprise` and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+   - Get the database image:\n+     - In the local shell, `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+     - In the local shell, `docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim`.\n+\n+\n+       {{% notice note %}} If a local Docker login and manual pull of `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` is not sufficient (for example, if you are using a remote Kubernetes cluster), then uncomment the `imagePullSecrets` stanza in `$WORKDIR/k8s-db-slim.yaml` and create the image pull secret as follows:\n+\n+              ```\n+              kubectl create secret docker-registry regsecret \\\n+                --docker-server=container-registry.oracle.com \\\n+                --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+                --docker-password=your-password \\\n+                --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+              ```\n+       {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+\n+   - Use the sample script in `$SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service` to create an Oracle database running in the pod, `oracle-db`.\n+\n+      **NOTE**: If your database image access requires the `regsecret` image pull secret that you optionally created above, then pass `-s regsecret` to the `start-db-service.sh` command line.\n+\n+     ```\n+     cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service\n+     start-db-service.sh\n+     ```\n+\n+     This script will deploy a database with the URL, `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`, and administration password, `Oradoc_db1`.\n+\n+     {{% notice warning %}} The Oracle database Docker images are supported only for non-production use.

The following example shows how to set up a sample RCU database and use the RCU tool to create the infrastructure schema for a JRF domain. The RCU database is set up with the following attributes:\n+\n+| Attribute | Value |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| database Kubernetes namespace | `default` |\n+| database Kubernetes pod | `oracle-db` |\n+| database image | `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` |\n+| database password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| infrastructure schema prefix | `FMW1` |\n+| infrastructure schema password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| database URL | `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s` |\n+\n+\n+1. Ensure you have access to the database image, and then deploy it:\n+\n+   - Use a browser to log in to `https://container-registry.oracle.com`, select `database->enterprise` and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+   - Get the database image:\n+     - In the local shell, `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+     - In the local shell, `docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim`.\n+\n+\n+       {{% notice note %}} If a local Docker login and manual pull of `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` is not sufficient (for example, if you are using a remote Kubernetes cluster), then uncomment the `imagePullSecrets` stanza in `$WORKDIR/k8s-db-slim.yaml` and create the image pull secret as follows:\n+\n+              ```\n+              kubectl create secret docker-registry regsecret \\\n+                --docker-server=container-registry.oracle.com \\\n+                --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+                --docker-password=your-password \\\n+                --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+              ```\n+       {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+\n+   - Use the sample script in `$SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service` to create an Oracle database running in the pod, `oracle-db`.\n+\n+      **NOTE**: If your database image access requires the `regsecret` image pull secret that you optionally created above, then pass `-s regsecret` to the `start-db-service.sh` command line.\n+\n+     ```\n+     cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service\n+     start-db-service.sh\n+     ```\n+\n+     This script will deploy a database with the URL, `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`, and administration password, `Oradoc_db1`.\n+\n+     {{% notice warning %}} The Oracle database Docker images are supported only for non-production use.

Similarly, `RestrictedJRF` domains may be used by Oracle layered products such as Oracle Communications products.\n+\n+### References\n+\n+To reference the relevant user documentation, see:\n+ - [Model in Image User Guide]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) user documentation\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Server Deploy Tooling](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling)\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool)\n+\n+\n+\n+### Prerequisites for all domain types\n+\n+1. The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable must be set and must reference a valid JDK 8 installation. (`JAVA_HOME` is used by the WebLogic Image Tool.)\n+\n+2. Set a source directory environment variable `SRCDIR` that references the parent of the operator source tree. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   mkdir ~/wlopsrc\n+   cd ~/wlopsrc\n+   git clone https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator.git\n+   export SRCDIR=$(pwd)/weblogic-kubernetes-operator\n+   ```\n+\n+   For additional information about obtaining the operator source, see the [Developer Guide Requirements](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/developerguide/requirements/).\n+\n+3. Create a sample directory environment variable `SAMPLEDIR` that references this sample's directory:\n+\n+   ```\n+   export SAMPLEDIR=${SRCDIR}/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image/\n+   ```\n+\n+4. Create an empty, temporary working directory with 10g of space, and store its location in the `WORKDIR` environment variable. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd <location of empty temporary directory with 10g of space>\n+   export WORKDIR=$(pwd)\n+   ```\n+\n+5. Deploy the operator and set up the operator to manage the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`. Optionally, deploy a Traefik load balancer that manages the same namespace. For example, follow the same steps as the [Quick Start](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/quickstart/), up through the [Prepare for a domain]({{< relref \"/quickstart/prepare.md\" >}}) step.\n+\n+   Note that:\n+   - Deploying the Traefik load balancer is optional, but is a prerequisite for testing the web application that's deployed to WebLogic as part of this sample.\n+   - You can skip the Quick Start steps for obtaining a WebLogic image because you will be creating your own Docker image.\n+\n+\n+6. Choose the type of domain you're going to create: `WLS`, `JRF`, or `RestrictedJRF`, and set the environment variable, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, accordingly. The default is `WLS`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   export WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE=<one of WLS, JRF, or RestrictedJRF>\n+   ```\n+\n+7. Set up access to a base image for this sample that will be used as the base image for creating the final image. Do one of the following:\n+\n+   - __Option 1, download an existing WebLogic image.__\n+\n+     Set up access to this sample's base WebLogic image at the [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com):\n+\n+     a. Use a browser to access [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com).\n+\n+     b. Choose an image location:\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF` domains, select `Middleware`, then `fmw-infrastructure`.\n+       - For `WLS` domains, select `Middleware`, then `weblogic`.\n+\n+     c. Select Sign In and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+     d. Use your terminal to locally log in to Docker: `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+\n+     e. Later, when you run the sample, it will call `docker pull` for your base image based on the domain type.\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4`.\n+       - For `WLS`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4`.\n+\n+   - __Option 2, create your own WebLogic base image.__\n+\n+     Alternatively, you can create your own base image and override the sample's default base image name and tag by exporting the `BASE_IMAGE_NAME` and `BASE_IMAGE_TAG` environment variables prior to running the sample scripts. If you want to create your own base image, see [Preparing a Base Image]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-in-image/base-images/_index.md\" >}}).\n+\n+8. If you are using a `JRF` domain type, then it requires an RCU infrastructure database. See [Prerequisites for JRF Domains](#prerequisites-for-jrf-domains). You can do this step before or after you create your final image. If you're not using a `JRF` domain type, proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image).\n+\n+### Prerequisites for JRF domains\n+\n+> __NOTE__: This section is only required for demonstrating a `JRF` domain type.

Ensure you have access to the database image, and then deploy it:\n+\n+   - Use a browser to log in to `https://container-registry.oracle.com`, select `database->enterprise` and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+   - Get the database image:\n+     - In the local shell, `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+     - In the local shell, `docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim`.\n+\n+\n+       {{% notice note %}} If a local Docker login and manual pull of `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` is not sufficient (for example, if you are using a remote Kubernetes cluster), then uncomment the `imagePullSecrets` stanza in `$WORKDIR/k8s-db-slim.yaml` and create the image pull secret as follows:\n+\n+              ```\n+              kubectl create secret docker-registry regsecret \\\n+                --docker-server=container-registry.oracle.com \\\n+                --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+                --docker-password=your-password \\\n+                --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+              ```\n+       {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+\n+   - Use the sample script in `$SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service` to create an Oracle database running in the pod, `oracle-db`.\n+\n+      **NOTE**: If your database image access requires the `regsecret` image pull secret that you optionally created above, then pass `-s regsecret` to the `start-db-service.sh` command line.\n+\n+     ```\n+     cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service\n+     start-db-service.sh\n+     ```\n+\n+     This script will deploy a database with the URL, `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`, and administration password, `Oradoc_db1`.\n+\n+     {{% notice warning %}} The Oracle database Docker images are supported only for non-production use.

Similarly, `RestrictedJRF` domains may be used by Oracle layered products such as Oracle Communications products.\n+\n+### References\n+\n+To reference the relevant user documentation, see:\n+ - [Model in Image User Guide]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) user documentation\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Server Deploy Tooling](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling)\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool)\n+\n+\n+\n+### Prerequisites for all domain types\n+\n+1. The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable must be set and must reference a valid JDK 8 installation. (`JAVA_HOME` is used by the WebLogic Image Tool.)\n+\n+2. Set a source directory environment variable `SRCDIR` that references the parent of the operator source tree. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   mkdir ~/wlopsrc\n+   cd ~/wlopsrc\n+   git clone https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator.git\n+   export SRCDIR=$(pwd)/weblogic-kubernetes-operator\n+   ```\n+\n+   For additional information about obtaining the operator source, see the [Developer Guide Requirements](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/developerguide/requirements/).\n+\n+3. Create a sample directory environment variable `SAMPLEDIR` that references this sample's directory:\n+\n+   ```\n+   export SAMPLEDIR=${SRCDIR}/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image/\n+   ```\n+\n+4. Create an empty, temporary working directory with 10g of space, and store its location in the `WORKDIR` environment variable. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd <location of empty temporary directory with 10g of space>\n+   export WORKDIR=$(pwd)\n+   ```\n+\n+5. Deploy the operator and set up the operator to manage the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`. Optionally, deploy a Traefik load balancer that manages the same namespace. For example, follow the same steps as the [Quick Start](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/quickstart/), up through the [Prepare for a domain]({{< relref \"/quickstart/prepare.md\" >}}) step.\n+\n+   Note that:\n+   - Deploying the Traefik load balancer is optional, but is a prerequisite for testing the web application that's deployed to WebLogic as part of this sample.\n+   - You can skip the Quick Start steps for obtaining a WebLogic image because you will be creating your own Docker image.\n+\n+\n+6. Choose the type of domain you're going to create: `WLS`, `JRF`, or `RestrictedJRF`, and set the environment variable, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, accordingly. The default is `WLS`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   export WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE=<one of WLS, JRF, or RestrictedJRF>\n+   ```\n+\n+7. Set up access to a base image for this sample that will be used as the base image for creating the final image. Do one of the following:\n+\n+   - __Option 1, download an existing WebLogic image.__\n+\n+     Set up access to this sample's base WebLogic image at the [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com):\n+\n+     a. Use a browser to access [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com).\n+\n+     b. Choose an image location:\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF` domains, select `Middleware`, then `fmw-infrastructure`.\n+       - For `WLS` domains, select `Middleware`, then `weblogic`.\n+\n+     c. Select Sign In and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+     d. Use your terminal to locally log in to Docker: `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+\n+     e. Later, when you run the sample, it will call `docker pull` for your base image based on the domain type.\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4`.\n+       - For `WLS`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4`.\n+\n+   - __Option 2, create your own WebLogic base image.__\n+\n+     Alternatively, you can create your own base image and override the sample's default base image name and tag by exporting the `BASE_IMAGE_NAME` and `BASE_IMAGE_TAG` environment variables prior to running the sample scripts. If you want to create your own base image, see [Preparing a Base Image]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-in-image/base-images/_index.md\" >}}).\n+\n+8. If you are using a `JRF` domain type, then it requires an RCU infrastructure database. See [Prerequisites for JRF Domains](#prerequisites-for-jrf-domains). You can do this step before or after you create your final image. If you're not using a `JRF` domain type, proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image).\n+\n+### Prerequisites for JRF domains\n+\n+> __NOTE__: This section is only required for demonstrating a `JRF` domain type. Skip this section and proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image) if your domain type is `WLS` or `RestrictedJRF`.\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database called an RCU database, requires initializing this database, and requires configuring your domain to access this database. All of these steps must occur before you first deploy your domain.\n+\n+Furthermore, if you want to have a restarted JRF domain access updates to the infrastructure database that the domain made at an earlier time, the restarted domain must be supplied a wallet file that was obtained from a previous run of the domain.\n+\n+The following steps demonstrate how to set up an infrastructure database that will work with this sample:\n+\n+  1. [Set up and initialize an RCU database](#set-up-and-initialize-an-rcu-database).\n+  2. [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout).\n+  3. [Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets](#set-up-rcu-model-attributes-domain-resource-attributes-and-secrets).\n+  4. [Reusing or sharing RCU tables](#reusing-or-sharing-rcu-tables).\n+\n+\n+\n+##### Set up and initialize an RCU database\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database and also requires initializing this database with a schema and a set of tables. The following example shows how to set up a sample RCU database and use the RCU tool to create the infrastructure schema for a JRF domain. The RCU database is set up with the following attributes:\n+\n+| Attribute | Value |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| database Kubernetes namespace | `default` |\n+| database Kubernetes pod | `oracle-db` |\n+| database image | `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` |\n+| database password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| infrastructure schema prefix | `FMW1` |\n+| infrastructure schema password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| database URL | `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s` |\n+\n+\n+1. Ensure you have access to the database image, and then deploy it:\n+\n+   - Use a browser to log in to `https://container-registry.oracle.com`, select `database->enterprise` and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+   - Get the database image:\n+     - In the local shell, `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+     - In the local shell, `docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim`.\n+\n+\n+       {{% notice note %}} If a local Docker login and manual pull of `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` is not sufficient (for example, if you are using a remote Kubernetes cluster), then uncomment the `imagePullSecrets` stanza in `$WORKDIR/k8s-db-slim.yaml` and create the image pull secret as follows:\n+\n+              ```\n+              kubectl create secret docker-registry regsecret \\\n+                --docker-server=container-registry.oracle.com \\\n+                --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+                --docker-password=your-password \\\n+                --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+              ```\n+       {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+\n+   - Use the sample script in `$SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service` to create an Oracle database running in the pod, `oracle-db`.\n+\n+      **NOTE**: If your database image access requires the `regsecret` image pull secret that you optionally created above, then pass `-s regsecret` to the `start-db-service.sh` command line.\n+\n+     ```\n+     cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service\n+     start-db-service.sh\n+     ```\n+\n+     This script will deploy a database with the URL, `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`, and administration password, `Oradoc_db1`.\n+\n+     {{% notice warning %}} The Oracle database Docker images are supported only for non-production use. For more details, see My Oracle Support note: Oracle Support for Database Running on Docker (Doc ID 2216342.1) : All the data is gone when the database is restarted.\n+     {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+     **NOTE**: This step is based on the steps documented in [Run a Database](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/userguide/overview/database/).\n+\n+2. Use the sample script in `SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema` to create the RCU schema with the schema prefix `FMW1`.\n+\n+   Note that this script assumes `Oradoc_db1` is the DBA password, `Oradoc_db1` is the schema password, and that the database URL is `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema\n+   ./create-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1 -i container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4\n+   ```\n+\n+   __NOTE__:  If you need to drop the repository, use this command:\n+\n+   ```\n+   drop-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1\n+   ```\n+\n+\n+##### Increase introspection job timeout\n+\n+Because JRF domain home creation takes a considerable amount of time the first time it is created, and because Model in Image creates your domain home for you using the introspection job, you should increase the timeout for the introspection job. Use the `configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds` in `k8s-domain.yaml.template` to override the default with a value of at least 300 seconds (the default is 120 seconds).  \n+\n+##### Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets\n+\n+To allow Model in Image to access the RCU database and OPSS wallet, it's necessary to set up an RCU access secret and an OPSS secret before deploying your domain. It's also necessary to define an `RCUDbInfo` stanza in your model. The sample already sets up all of these for you.  See:\n+\n+| Sample file | Description |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, with `password=welcome1`. |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, with appropriate values for attributes `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string`. |\n+| `model1.yaml.jrf` | Populates the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string` attributes by referencing their locations in the `sample-domain1-rcu-access` secret. The `build.sh` script uses this model instead of `model.yaml.wls` when the source domain type is `JRF`. |\n+| `k8s-domain.yaml.template` | Ensures that the domain mounts the OPSS key secret by setting the domain resource `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` attribute to `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, and ensures the domain mounts the RCU access secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, for reference by WDT model macros by setting the domain resource `configuration.secrets` attribute. Use configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds to increase the timeout value of the introspector job; see [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout). |\n+\n+ **NOTE**: This step is for information purposes only. Do not run the above sample files directly. The sample's main build and run scripts will run them for you.\n+\n+##### Reusing or sharing RCU tables\n+\n+Note that when you succesfully deploy your JRF domain resource for the first time, the introspector job will initialize the RCU tables for the domain using the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza in the WDT model plus the `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` specified in the domain resource. The job will also create a new domain home. Finally, the operator will also capture an OPSS wallet file from the new domain's local directory and place this file in a new Kubernetes config map.\n+\n+There are scenarios when the domain needs to be re-created between updates such as WebLogic credentials are changed, security roles defined in the WDT model have been changed or you want to share the same RCU tables with different domains.  Under these scenarios, the operator needs the `walletPasswordSecret` as well as the OPSS wallet file, together with the exact information in `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` so that the domain can be re-created and access the same set of RCU tables.  Without the wallet file and wallet password, you will not be able to re-create a domain accessing the same set of RCU tables, therefore it is highly recommended to backup the wallet file.\n+\n+To recover a domain's RCU tables between domain restarts or to share an RCU schema between different domains, it is necessary to extract this wallet file from the config map and save the OPSS wallet password secret that was used for the original domain. The wallet password and wallet file are needed again when you recreate the domain or share the database with other domains.\n+\n+To save the wallet file:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -s [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>]\n+```\n+\n+You should back up this file to a safe location that can be retrieved later.\n+\n+To reuse the wallet for subsequent redeployments or share the RCU tables between different domains:\n+\n+1. Store the wallet in a secret:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -r [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>] [-ws <name of the secret. Default DOMAIN_UID-opss-walletfile-secret> ]\n+\n+```\n+\n+2. Modify the domain resource YAML file to provide the secret names:\n+\n+```\n+  configuration:\n+    opss:\n+      # Name of secret with walletPassword for extracting the wallet\n+      walletPasswordSecret: sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret      \n+      # Name of secret with walletFile containing base64 encoded opss wallet\n+      walletFileSecret: sample-domain1-opss-walletfile-secret\n+\n+```\n+\n+See [Reusing an RCU database]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/reusing-rcu.md\" >}}) for instructions.\n+\n+### Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image\n+\n+Model in Image must contain a WebLogic install, a WebLogic Deploy Tool install, and your WDT model files. You can use the sample `./build.sh` script to build this image, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Uses `docker pull` to obtain a base image. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types) to set up access to the base image.)\n+  - Downloads the latest WebLogic Image Tool and WebLogic Deploy Tool to `WORKDIR`.\n+  - Creates and populates a staging directory `$WORKDIR/models` that contains your WDT model files and WDT application archive.\n+    - Builds  a simple servlet application in `$SAMPLEDIR/sample_app` into a WDT model application archive `$WORKDIR/models/archive1.zip`.\n+    - Copies sample model files from `$SAMPLEDIR/model-in-image` to `$WORKDIR/models`. This uses a model file that is appropriate to the domain type (for example, the `JRF` domain model includes database access configuration).\n+  - Uses the WebLogic Image Tool and the `$WORKDIR/models` staging directory to create a final image named `model-in-image:v1` that layers on the base image. Specifically, it runs the WebLogic Image Tool with its `update` option, which:\n+    - Builds the final image as a layer on the base image.\n+    - Puts a WDT install in image location, `/u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy`.\n+    - Copies the WDT model, properties, and application archive from `$WORDKIR/models` to image location, `/u01/wdt/models`.\n+\n+The script expects `JAVA_HOME`, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).)\n+\n+Run the script:\n+\n+  ```\n+  $SAMPLEDIR/build.sh\n+  ```\n+\n+If you intend to use a remote Docker registry, you need to tag and push the image to the remote Docker registry.\n+\n+1.  Tag the image for the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker tag <image-name>:<tag> <region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>:<tag>\n+```\n+\n+2.  Push the image to the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker push <region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>:<tag>\n+```\n+\n+3. Create the pull secret for the remote Docker registry:\n+\n+```\n+ kubectl -n <domain namespace> create secret docker-registry <secret name> \\\n+     --docker-server=<region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name> \\\n+     --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+     --docker-password=your-password \\\n+     --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+\n+```\n+\n+4. Update the domain template file `$SAMPLEDIR/k8s-domain.yaml.template` to provide the `imagePullSecrets`:\n+\n+```\n+  imagePullSecrets:\n+  - name: <secret name>\n+\n+```\n+\n+5. Export the environment variables for the image name and tag using the same values in step 1:\n+\n+```\n+export MODEL_IMAGE_NAME=\"<region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>\"\n+export MODEL_IMAGE_TAG=\"<tag>\"\n+```\n+\n+### Create and deploy your Kubernetes resources\n+\n+To deploy the sample operator domain and its required Kubernetes resources, use the sample script, `$SAMPLEDIR/run_domain.sh`, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Deletes the domain with a `DomainUID` of `domain1` in the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`, if it already exists.\n+  - Creates a secret containing your WebLogic administrator user name and password.\n+  - Creates a secret containing your Model in Image runtime encryption password:\n+    - All model-in-image domains must supply a runtime encryption secret with a `password` value.\n+    - It is used to encrypt configuration that is passed around internally by the Operator.\n+    - The value must be kept private but can be arbitrary: you can optionally supply a different secret value every time you restart the domain.\n+  - Creates secrets containing your RCU access URL, credentials, and prefix (these are unused unless the domain type is `JRF`).\n+  - Creates a config map containing an additional WDT model properties file, `$SAMPLEDIR/model1.20.properties`.\n+  - Generates a domain resource YAML file, `$WORKDIR/k8s-domain.yaml`, using `$SAMPLEDIR/k8s-domain.yaml.template`.\n+  - Deploys `k8s-domain.yaml`.\n+  - Displays the status of the domain pods.\n+\n+The script expects `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE` and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized.

Similarly, `RestrictedJRF` domains may be used by Oracle layered products such as Oracle Communications products.\n+\n+### References\n+\n+To reference the relevant user documentation, see:\n+ - [Model in Image User Guide]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) user documentation\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Server Deploy Tooling](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling)\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool)\n+\n+\n+\n+### Prerequisites for all domain types\n+\n+1. The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable must be set and must reference a valid JDK 8 installation. (`JAVA_HOME` is used by the WebLogic Image Tool.)\n+\n+2. Set a source directory environment variable `SRCDIR` that references the parent of the operator source tree. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   mkdir ~/wlopsrc\n+   cd ~/wlopsrc\n+   git clone https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator.git\n+   export SRCDIR=$(pwd)/weblogic-kubernetes-operator\n+   ```\n+\n+   For additional information about obtaining the operator source, see the [Developer Guide Requirements](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/developerguide/requirements/).\n+\n+3. Create a sample directory environment variable `SAMPLEDIR` that references this sample's directory:\n+\n+   ```\n+   export SAMPLEDIR=${SRCDIR}/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image/\n+   ```\n+\n+4. Create an empty, temporary working directory with 10g of space, and store its location in the `WORKDIR` environment variable. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd <location of empty temporary directory with 10g of space>\n+   export WORKDIR=$(pwd)\n+   ```\n+\n+5. Deploy the operator and set up the operator to manage the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`. Optionally, deploy a Traefik load balancer that manages the same namespace. For example, follow the same steps as the [Quick Start](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/quickstart/), up through the [Prepare for a domain]({{< relref \"/quickstart/prepare.md\" >}}) step.\n+\n+   Note that:\n+   - Deploying the Traefik load balancer is optional, but is a prerequisite for testing the web application that's deployed to WebLogic as part of this sample.\n+   - You can skip the Quick Start steps for obtaining a WebLogic image because you will be creating your own Docker image.\n+\n+\n+6. Choose the type of domain you're going to create: `WLS`, `JRF`, or `RestrictedJRF`, and set the environment variable, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, accordingly. The default is `WLS`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   export WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE=<one of WLS, JRF, or RestrictedJRF>\n+   ```\n+\n+7. Set up access to a base image for this sample that will be used as the base image for creating the final image. Do one of the following:\n+\n+   - __Option 1, download an existing WebLogic image.__\n+\n+     Set up access to this sample's base WebLogic image at the [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com):\n+\n+     a. Use a browser to access [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com).\n+\n+     b. Choose an image location:\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF` domains, select `Middleware`, then `fmw-infrastructure`.\n+       - For `WLS` domains, select `Middleware`, then `weblogic`.\n+\n+     c. Select Sign In and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+     d. Use your terminal to locally log in to Docker: `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+\n+     e. Later, when you run the sample, it will call `docker pull` for your base image based on the domain type.\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4`.\n+       - For `WLS`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4`.\n+\n+   - __Option 2, create your own WebLogic base image.__\n+\n+     Alternatively, you can create your own base image and override the sample's default base image name and tag by exporting the `BASE_IMAGE_NAME` and `BASE_IMAGE_TAG` environment variables prior to running the sample scripts. If you want to create your own base image, see [Preparing a Base Image]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-in-image/base-images/_index.md\" >}}).\n+\n+8. If you are using a `JRF` domain type, then it requires an RCU infrastructure database. See [Prerequisites for JRF Domains](#prerequisites-for-jrf-domains). You can do this step before or after you create your final image. If you're not using a `JRF` domain type, proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image).\n+\n+### Prerequisites for JRF domains\n+\n+> __NOTE__: This section is only required for demonstrating a `JRF` domain type. Skip this section and proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image) if your domain type is `WLS` or `RestrictedJRF`.\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database called an RCU database, requires initializing this database, and requires configuring your domain to access this database. All of these steps must occur before you first deploy your domain.\n+\n+Furthermore, if you want to have a restarted JRF domain access updates to the infrastructure database that the domain made at an earlier time, the restarted domain must be supplied a wallet file that was obtained from a previous run of the domain.\n+\n+The following steps demonstrate how to set up an infrastructure database that will work with this sample:\n+\n+  1. [Set up and initialize an RCU database](#set-up-and-initialize-an-rcu-database).\n+  2. [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout).\n+  3. [Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets](#set-up-rcu-model-attributes-domain-resource-attributes-and-secrets).\n+  4. [Reusing or sharing RCU tables](#reusing-or-sharing-rcu-tables).\n+\n+\n+\n+##### Set up and initialize an RCU database\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database and also requires initializing this database with a schema and a set of tables. The following example shows how to set up a sample RCU database and use the RCU tool to create the infrastructure schema for a JRF domain. The RCU database is set up with the following attributes:\n+\n+| Attribute | Value |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| database Kubernetes namespace | `default` |\n+| database Kubernetes pod | `oracle-db` |\n+| database image | `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` |\n+| database password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| infrastructure schema prefix | `FMW1` |\n+| infrastructure schema password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| database URL | `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s` |\n+\n+\n+1. Ensure you have access to the database image, and then deploy it:\n+\n+   - Use a browser to log in to `https://container-registry.oracle.com`, select `database->enterprise` and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+   - Get the database image:\n+     - In the local shell, `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+     - In the local shell, `docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim`.\n+\n+\n+       {{% notice note %}} If a local Docker login and manual pull of `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` is not sufficient (for example, if you are using a remote Kubernetes cluster), then uncomment the `imagePullSecrets` stanza in `$WORKDIR/k8s-db-slim.yaml` and create the image pull secret as follows:\n+\n+              ```\n+              kubectl create secret docker-registry regsecret \\\n+                --docker-server=container-registry.oracle.com \\\n+                --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+                --docker-password=your-password \\\n+                --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+              ```\n+       {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+\n+   - Use the sample script in `$SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service` to create an Oracle database running in the pod, `oracle-db`.\n+\n+      **NOTE**: If your database image access requires the `regsecret` image pull secret that you optionally created above, then pass `-s regsecret` to the `start-db-service.sh` command line.\n+\n+     ```\n+     cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service\n+     start-db-service.sh\n+     ```\n+\n+     This script will deploy a database with the URL, `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`, and administration password, `Oradoc_db1`.\n+\n+     {{% notice warning %}} The Oracle database Docker images are supported only for non-production use. For more details, see My Oracle Support note: Oracle Support for Database Running on Docker (Doc ID 2216342.1) : All the data is gone when the database is restarted.\n+     {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+     **NOTE**: This step is based on the steps documented in [Run a Database](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/userguide/overview/database/).\n+\n+2. Use the sample script in `SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema` to create the RCU schema with the schema prefix `FMW1`.\n+\n+   Note that this script assumes `Oradoc_db1` is the DBA password, `Oradoc_db1` is the schema password, and that the database URL is `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema\n+   ./create-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1 -i container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4\n+   ```\n+\n+   __NOTE__:  If you need to drop the repository, use this command:\n+\n+   ```\n+   drop-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1\n+   ```\n+\n+\n+##### Increase introspection job timeout\n+\n+Because JRF domain home creation takes a considerable amount of time the first time it is created, and because Model in Image creates your domain home for you using the introspection job, you should increase the timeout for the introspection job. Use the `configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds` in `k8s-domain.yaml.template` to override the default with a value of at least 300 seconds (the default is 120 seconds).  \n+\n+##### Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets\n+\n+To allow Model in Image to access the RCU database and OPSS wallet, it's necessary to set up an RCU access secret and an OPSS secret before deploying your domain. It's also necessary to define an `RCUDbInfo` stanza in your model. The sample already sets up all of these for you.  See:\n+\n+| Sample file | Description |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, with `password=welcome1`. |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, with appropriate values for attributes `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string`. |\n+| `model1.yaml.jrf` | Populates the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string` attributes by referencing their locations in the `sample-domain1-rcu-access` secret. The `build.sh` script uses this model instead of `model.yaml.wls` when the source domain type is `JRF`. |\n+| `k8s-domain.yaml.template` | Ensures that the domain mounts the OPSS key secret by setting the domain resource `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` attribute to `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, and ensures the domain mounts the RCU access secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, for reference by WDT model macros by setting the domain resource `configuration.secrets` attribute. Use configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds to increase the timeout value of the introspector job; see [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout). |\n+\n+ **NOTE**: This step is for information purposes only. Do not run the above sample files directly. The sample's main build and run scripts will run them for you.\n+\n+##### Reusing or sharing RCU tables\n+\n+Note that when you succesfully deploy your JRF domain resource for the first time, the introspector job will initialize the RCU tables for the domain using the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza in the WDT model plus the `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` specified in the domain resource. The job will also create a new domain home. Finally, the operator will also capture an OPSS wallet file from the new domain's local directory and place this file in a new Kubernetes config map.\n+\n+There are scenarios when the domain needs to be re-created between updates such as WebLogic credentials are changed, security roles defined in the WDT model have been changed or you want to share the same RCU tables with different domains.  Under these scenarios, the operator needs the `walletPasswordSecret` as well as the OPSS wallet file, together with the exact information in `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` so that the domain can be re-created and access the same set of RCU tables.  Without the wallet file and wallet password, you will not be able to re-create a domain accessing the same set of RCU tables, therefore it is highly recommended to backup the wallet file.\n+\n+To recover a domain's RCU tables between domain restarts or to share an RCU schema between different domains, it is necessary to extract this wallet file from the config map and save the OPSS wallet password secret that was used for the original domain. The wallet password and wallet file are needed again when you recreate the domain or share the database with other domains.\n+\n+To save the wallet file:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -s [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>]\n+```\n+\n+You should back up this file to a safe location that can be retrieved later.\n+\n+To reuse the wallet for subsequent redeployments or share the RCU tables between different domains:\n+\n+1. Store the wallet in a secret:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -r [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>] [-ws <name of the secret. Default DOMAIN_UID-opss-walletfile-secret> ]\n+\n+```\n+\n+2. Modify the domain resource YAML file to provide the secret names:\n+\n+```\n+  configuration:\n+    opss:\n+      # Name of secret with walletPassword for extracting the wallet\n+      walletPasswordSecret: sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret      \n+      # Name of secret with walletFile containing base64 encoded opss wallet\n+      walletFileSecret: sample-domain1-opss-walletfile-secret\n+\n+```\n+\n+See [Reusing an RCU database]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/reusing-rcu.md\" >}}) for instructions.\n+\n+### Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image\n+\n+Model in Image must contain a WebLogic install, a WebLogic Deploy Tool install, and your WDT model files. You can use the sample `./build.sh` script to build this image, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Uses `docker pull` to obtain a base image. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types) to set up access to the base image.)\n+  - Downloads the latest WebLogic Image Tool and WebLogic Deploy Tool to `WORKDIR`.\n+  - Creates and populates a staging directory `$WORKDIR/models` that contains your WDT model files and WDT application archive.\n+    - Builds  a simple servlet application in `$SAMPLEDIR/sample_app` into a WDT model application archive `$WORKDIR/models/archive1.zip`.\n+    - Copies sample model files from `$SAMPLEDIR/model-in-image` to `$WORKDIR/models`. This uses a model file that is appropriate to the domain type (for example, the `JRF` domain model includes database access configuration).\n+  - Uses the WebLogic Image Tool and the `$WORKDIR/models` staging directory to create a final image named `model-in-image:v1` that layers on the base image. Specifically, it runs the WebLogic Image Tool with its `update` option, which:\n+    - Builds the final image as a layer on the base image.\n+    - Puts a WDT install in image location, `/u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy`.\n+    - Copies the WDT model, properties, and application archive from `$WORDKIR/models` to image location, `/u01/wdt/models`.\n+\n+The script expects `JAVA_HOME`, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).)\n+\n+Run the script:\n+\n+  ```\n+  $SAMPLEDIR/build.sh\n+  ```\n+\n+If you intend to use a remote Docker registry, you need to tag and push the image to the remote Docker registry.\n+\n+1.  Tag the image for the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker tag <image-name>:<tag> <region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>:<tag>\n+```\n+\n+2.  Push the image to the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker push <region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>:<tag>\n+```\n+\n+3. Create the pull secret for the remote Docker registry:\n+\n+```\n+ kubectl -n <domain namespace> create secret docker-registry <secret name> \\\n+     --docker-server=<region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name> \\\n+     --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+     --docker-password=your-password \\\n+     --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+\n+```\n+\n+4. Update the domain template file `$SAMPLEDIR/k8s-domain.yaml.template` to provide the `imagePullSecrets`:\n+\n+```\n+  imagePullSecrets:\n+  - name: <secret name>\n+\n+```\n+\n+5. Export the environment variables for the image name and tag using the same values in step 1:\n+\n+```\n+export MODEL_IMAGE_NAME=\"<region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>\"\n+export MODEL_IMAGE_TAG=\"<tag>\"\n+```\n+\n+### Create and deploy your Kubernetes resources\n+\n+To deploy the sample operator domain and its required Kubernetes resources, use the sample script, `$SAMPLEDIR/run_domain.sh`, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Deletes the domain with a `DomainUID` of `domain1` in the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`, if it already exists.\n+  - Creates a secret containing your WebLogic administrator user name and password.\n+  - Creates a secret containing your Model in Image runtime encryption password:\n+    - All model-in-image domains must supply a runtime encryption secret with a `password` value.\n+    - It is used to encrypt configuration that is passed around internally by the Operator.\n+    - The value must be kept private but can be arbitrary: you can optionally supply a different secret value every time you restart the domain.\n+  - Creates secrets containing your RCU access URL, credentials, and prefix (these are unused unless the domain type is `JRF`).\n+  - Creates a config map containing an additional WDT model properties file, `$SAMPLEDIR/model1.20.properties`.\n+  - Generates a domain resource YAML file, `$WORKDIR/k8s-domain.yaml`, using `$SAMPLEDIR/k8s-domain.yaml.template`.\n+  - Deploys `k8s-domain.yaml`.\n+  - Displays the status of the domain pods.\n+\n+The script expects `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE` and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).)\n+\n+Run the script:\n+\n+  ```\n+  $SAMPLEDIR/run_domain.sh\n+  ```\n+\n+At the end, you will see the message `Getting pod status - ctrl-c when all is running and ready to exit`.

For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   mkdir ~/wlopsrc\n+   cd ~/wlopsrc\n+   git clone https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator.git\n+   export SRCDIR=$(pwd)/weblogic-kubernetes-operator\n+   ```\n+\n+   For additional information about obtaining the operator source, see the [Developer Guide Requirements](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/developerguide/requirements/).\n+\n+3. Create a sample directory environment variable `SAMPLEDIR` that references this sample's directory:\n+\n+   ```\n+   export SAMPLEDIR=${SRCDIR}/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image/\n+   ```\n+\n+4. Create an empty, temporary working directory with 10g of space, and store its location in the `WORKDIR` environment variable. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd <location of empty temporary directory with 10g of space>\n+   export WORKDIR=$(pwd)\n+   ```\n+\n+5. Deploy the operator and set up the operator to manage the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`. Optionally, deploy a Traefik load balancer that manages the same namespace. For example, follow the same steps as the [Quick Start](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/quickstart/), up through the [Prepare for a domain]({{< relref \"/quickstart/prepare.md\" >}}) step.\n+\n+   Note that:\n+   - Deploying the Traefik load balancer is optional, but is a prerequisite for testing the web application that's deployed to WebLogic as part of this sample.\n+   - You can skip the Quick Start steps for obtaining a WebLogic image because you will be creating your own Docker image.\n+\n+\n+6. Choose the type of domain you're going to create: `WLS`, `JRF`, or `RestrictedJRF`, and set the environment variable, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, accordingly. The default is `WLS`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   export WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE=<one of WLS, JRF, or RestrictedJRF>\n+   ```\n+\n+7. Set up access to a base image for this sample that will be used as the base image for creating the final image. Do one of the following:\n+\n+   - __Option 1, download an existing WebLogic image.__\n+\n+     Set up access to this sample's base WebLogic image at the [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com):\n+\n+     a. Use a browser to access [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com).\n+\n+     b. Choose an image location:\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF` domains, select `Middleware`, then `fmw-infrastructure`.\n+       - For `WLS` domains, select `Middleware`, then `weblogic`.\n+\n+     c. Select Sign In and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+     d. Use your terminal to locally log in to Docker: `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+\n+     e. Later, when you run the sample, it will call `docker pull` for your base image based on the domain type.\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4`.\n+       - For `WLS`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4`.\n+\n+   - __Option 2, create your own WebLogic base image.__\n+\n+     Alternatively, you can create your own base image and override the sample's default base image name and tag by exporting the `BASE_IMAGE_NAME` and `BASE_IMAGE_TAG` environment variables prior to running the sample scripts. If you want to create your own base image, see [Preparing a Base Image]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-in-image/base-images/_index.md\" >}}).\n+\n+8. If you are using a `JRF` domain type, then it requires an RCU infrastructure database. See [Prerequisites for JRF Domains](#prerequisites-for-jrf-domains). You can do this step before or after you create your final image. If you're not using a `JRF` domain type, proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image).\n+\n+### Prerequisites for JRF domains\n+\n+> __NOTE__: This section is only required for demonstrating a `JRF` domain type. Skip this section and proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image) if your domain type is `WLS` or `RestrictedJRF`.\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database called an RCU database, requires initializing this database, and requires configuring your domain to access this database. All of these steps must occur before you first deploy your domain.\n+\n+Furthermore, if you want to have a restarted JRF domain access updates to the infrastructure database that the domain made at an earlier time, the restarted domain must be supplied a wallet file that was obtained from a previous run of the domain.\n+\n+The following steps demonstrate how to set up an infrastructure database that will work with this sample:\n+\n+  1. [Set up and initialize an RCU database](#set-up-and-initialize-an-rcu-database).\n+  2. [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout).\n+  3. [Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets](#set-up-rcu-model-attributes-domain-resource-attributes-and-secrets).\n+  4. [Reusing or sharing RCU tables](#reusing-or-sharing-rcu-tables).\n+\n+\n+\n+##### Set up and initialize an RCU database\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database and also requires initializing this database with a schema and a set of tables. The following example shows how to set up a sample RCU database and use the RCU tool to create the infrastructure schema for a JRF domain. The RCU database is set up with the following attributes:\n+\n+| Attribute | Value |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| database Kubernetes namespace | `default` |\n+| database Kubernetes pod | `oracle-db` |\n+| database image | `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` |\n+| database password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| infrastructure schema prefix | `FMW1` |\n+| infrastructure schema password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| database URL | `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s` |\n+\n+\n+1. Ensure you have access to the database image, and then deploy it:\n+\n+   - Use a browser to log in to `https://container-registry.oracle.com`, select `database->enterprise` and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+   - Get the database image:\n+     - In the local shell, `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+     - In the local shell, `docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim`.\n+\n+\n+       {{% notice note %}} If a local Docker login and manual pull of `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` is not sufficient (for example, if you are using a remote Kubernetes cluster), then uncomment the `imagePullSecrets` stanza in `$WORKDIR/k8s-db-slim.yaml` and create the image pull secret as follows:\n+\n+              ```\n+              kubectl create secret docker-registry regsecret \\\n+                --docker-server=container-registry.oracle.com \\\n+                --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+                --docker-password=your-password \\\n+                --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+              ```\n+       {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+\n+   - Use the sample script in `$SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service` to create an Oracle database running in the pod, `oracle-db`.\n+\n+      **NOTE**: If your database image access requires the `regsecret` image pull secret that you optionally created above, then pass `-s regsecret` to the `start-db-service.sh` command line.\n+\n+     ```\n+     cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service\n+     start-db-service.sh\n+     ```\n+\n+     This script will deploy a database with the URL, `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`, and administration password, `Oradoc_db1`.\n+\n+     {{% notice warning %}} The Oracle database Docker images are supported only for non-production use. For more details, see My Oracle Support note: Oracle Support for Database Running on Docker (Doc ID 2216342.1) : All the data is gone when the database is restarted.\n+     {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+     **NOTE**: This step is based on the steps documented in [Run a Database](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/userguide/overview/database/).\n+\n+2. Use the sample script in `SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema` to create the RCU schema with the schema prefix `FMW1`.\n+\n+   Note that this script assumes `Oradoc_db1` is the DBA password, `Oradoc_db1` is the schema password, and that the database URL is `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema\n+   ./create-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1 -i container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4\n+   ```\n+\n+   __NOTE__:  If you need to drop the repository, use this command:\n+\n+   ```\n+   drop-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1\n+   ```\n+\n+\n+##### Increase introspection job timeout\n+\n+Because JRF domain home creation takes a considerable amount of time the first time it is created, and because Model in Image creates your domain home for you using the introspection job, you should increase the timeout for the introspection job. Use the `configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds` in `k8s-domain.yaml.template` to override the default with a value of at least 300 seconds (the default is 120 seconds).  \n+\n+##### Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets\n+\n+To allow Model in Image to access the RCU database and OPSS wallet, it's necessary to set up an RCU access secret and an OPSS secret before deploying your domain. It's also necessary to define an `RCUDbInfo` stanza in your model. The sample already sets up all of these for you.  See:\n+\n+| Sample file | Description |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, with `password=welcome1`. |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, with appropriate values for attributes `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string`. |\n+| `model1.yaml.jrf` | Populates the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string` attributes by referencing their locations in the `sample-domain1-rcu-access` secret. The `build.sh` script uses this model instead of `model.yaml.wls` when the source domain type is `JRF`. |\n+| `k8s-domain.yaml.template` | Ensures that the domain mounts the OPSS key secret by setting the domain resource `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` attribute to `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, and ensures the domain mounts the RCU access secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, for reference by WDT model macros by setting the domain resource `configuration.secrets` attribute. Use configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds to increase the timeout value of the introspector job; see [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout). |\n+\n+ **NOTE**: This step is for information purposes only. Do not run the above sample files directly. The sample's main build and run scripts will run them for you.\n+\n+##### Reusing or sharing RCU tables\n+\n+Note that when you succesfully deploy your JRF domain resource for the first time, the introspector job will initialize the RCU tables for the domain using the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza in the WDT model plus the `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` specified in the domain resource. The job will also create a new domain home. Finally, the operator will also capture an OPSS wallet file from the new domain's local directory and place this file in a new Kubernetes config map.\n+\n+There are scenarios when the domain needs to be re-created between updates such as WebLogic credentials are changed, security roles defined in the WDT model have been changed or you want to share the same RCU tables with different domains.  Under these scenarios, the operator needs the `walletPasswordSecret` as well as the OPSS wallet file, together with the exact information in `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` so that the domain can be re-created and access the same set of RCU tables.  Without the wallet file and wallet password, you will not be able to re-create a domain accessing the same set of RCU tables, therefore it is highly recommended to backup the wallet file.\n+\n+To recover a domain's RCU tables between domain restarts or to share an RCU schema between different domains, it is necessary to extract this wallet file from the config map and save the OPSS wallet password secret that was used for the original domain. The wallet password and wallet file are needed again when you recreate the domain or share the database with other domains.\n+\n+To save the wallet file:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -s [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>]\n+```\n+\n+You should back up this file to a safe location that can be retrieved later.\n+\n+To reuse the wallet for subsequent redeployments or share the RCU tables between different domains:\n+\n+1. Store the wallet in a secret:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -r [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>] [-ws <name of the secret. Default DOMAIN_UID-opss-walletfile-secret> ]\n+\n+```\n+\n+2. Modify the domain resource YAML file to provide the secret names:\n+\n+```\n+  configuration:\n+    opss:\n+      # Name of secret with walletPassword for extracting the wallet\n+      walletPasswordSecret: sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret      \n+      # Name of secret with walletFile containing base64 encoded opss wallet\n+      walletFileSecret: sample-domain1-opss-walletfile-secret\n+\n+```\n+\n+See [Reusing an RCU database]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/reusing-rcu.md\" >}}) for instructions.\n+\n+### Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image\n+\n+Model in Image must contain a WebLogic install, a WebLogic Deploy Tool install, and your WDT model files. You can use the sample `./build.sh` script to build this image, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Uses `docker pull` to obtain a base image. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types) to set up access to the base image.)\n+  - Downloads the latest WebLogic Image Tool and WebLogic Deploy Tool to `WORKDIR`.\n+  - Creates and populates a staging directory `$WORKDIR/models` that contains your WDT model files and WDT application archive.\n+    - Builds  a simple servlet application in `$SAMPLEDIR/sample_app` into a WDT model application archive `$WORKDIR/models/archive1.zip`.\n+    - Copies sample model files from `$SAMPLEDIR/model-in-image` to `$WORKDIR/models`. This uses a model file that is appropriate to the domain type (for example, the `JRF` domain model includes database access configuration).\n+  - Uses the WebLogic Image Tool and the `$WORKDIR/models` staging directory to create a final image named `model-in-image:v1` that layers on the base image. Specifically, it runs the WebLogic Image Tool with its `update` option, which:\n+    - Builds the final image as a layer on the base image.\n+    - Puts a WDT install in image location, `/u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy`.\n+    - Copies the WDT model, properties, and application archive from `$WORDKIR/models` to image location, `/u01/wdt/models`.\n+\n+The script expects `JAVA_HOME`, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).)\n+\n+Run the script:\n+\n+  ```\n+  $SAMPLEDIR/build.sh\n+  ```\n+\n+If you intend to use a remote Docker registry, you need to tag and push the image to the remote Docker registry.\n+\n+1.  Tag the image for the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker tag <image-name>:<tag> <region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>:<tag>\n+```\n+\n+2.  Push the image to the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker push <region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>:<tag>\n+```\n+\n+3. Create the pull secret for the remote Docker registry:\n+\n+```\n+ kubectl -n <domain namespace> create secret docker-registry <secret name> \\\n+     --docker-server=<region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name> \\\n+     --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+     --docker-password=your-password \\\n+     --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+\n+```\n+\n+4. Update the domain template file `$SAMPLEDIR/k8s-domain.yaml.template` to provide the `imagePullSecrets`:\n+\n+```\n+  imagePullSecrets:\n+  - name: <secret name>\n+\n+```\n+\n+5. Export the environment variables for the image name and tag using the same values in step 1:\n+\n+```\n+export MODEL_IMAGE_NAME=\"<region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>\"\n+export MODEL_IMAGE_TAG=\"<tag>\"\n+```\n+\n+### Create and deploy your Kubernetes resources\n+\n+To deploy the sample operator domain and its required Kubernetes resources, use the sample script, `$SAMPLEDIR/run_domain.sh`, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Deletes the domain with a `DomainUID` of `domain1` in the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`, if it already exists.\n+  - Creates a secret containing your WebLogic administrator user name and password.\n+  - Creates a secret containing your Model in Image runtime encryption password:\n+    - All model-in-image domains must supply a runtime encryption secret with a `password` value.\n+    - It is used to encrypt configuration that is passed around internally by the Operator.\n+    - The value must be kept private but can be arbitrary: you can optionally supply a different secret value every time you restart the domain.\n+  - Creates secrets containing your RCU access URL, credentials, and prefix (these are unused unless the domain type is `JRF`).\n+  - Creates a config map containing an additional WDT model properties file, `$SAMPLEDIR/model1.20.properties`.\n+  - Generates a domain resource YAML file, `$WORKDIR/k8s-domain.yaml`, using `$SAMPLEDIR/k8s-domain.yaml.template`.\n+  - Deploys `k8s-domain.yaml`.\n+  - Displays the status of the domain pods.\n+\n+The script expects `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE` and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).)\n+\n+Run the script:\n+\n+  ```\n+  $SAMPLEDIR/run_domain.sh\n+  ```\n+\n+At the end, you will see the message `Getting pod status - ctrl-c when all is running and ready to exit`. Then you should see a WebLogic Administration Server and two Managed Server pods start. After all the pods are up, you can use `ctrl-c` to exit the build script.\n+", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5NjY4MjA1OA=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "3f46823be21e32c4b54a101d5590aeb40dbcdb15"}, "originalPosition": 344}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5NzUxNzY3MA==", "bodyText": "Done.", "url": "https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/pull/1478#discussion_r397517670", "createdAt": "2020-03-24T23:14:28Z", "author": {"login": "tbarnes-us"}, "path": "docs-source/content/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,520 @@\n+---\n+title: \"Model in image\"\n+date: 2019-02-23T17:32:31-05:00\n+weight: 4\n+description: \"Sample for supplying a WebLogic Deploy Tool (WDT) model that the operator automatically expands into a full domain home during runtime.\"\n+---\n+\n+### Contents\n+\n+  - [Introduction](#introduction)\n+  - [References](#references)\n+  - [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types)\n+  - [Prerequisites for JRF domains](#prerequisites-for-jrf-domains)\n+    - [Set Up and Initialize an RCU Database](#set-up-and-initialize-an-rcu-database)\n+    - [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout)\n+    - [Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets](#set-up-rcu-model-attributes-domain-resource-attributes-and-secrets)\n+    - [Reusing or sharing RCU tables](#reusing-or-sharing-rcu-tables)\n+  - [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image)\n+  - [Create and deploy your Kubernetes resources](#create-and-deploy-your-kubernetes-resources)\n+  - [Optionally test the sample application](#optionally-test-the-sample-application)\n+  - [Optionally access the WebLogic console](#optionally-access-the-weblogic-console)\n+  - [Cleanup](#cleanup)\n+\n+### Introduction\n+\n+This sample demonstrates:\n+\n+  - Using the WebLogic Image Tool to create a Docker image that contains a WebLogic install, a WebLogic Deploy Tool (WDT) install, a Java EE servlet application contained within a WDT archive, and a WebLogic domain that's defined using a WDT model file.\n+  - Modifying the WDT model that's embedded within the Docker image using a WDT model file that's supplied using a Kubernetes config map.\n+  - Defining a `domainHomeSourceType: FromModel` domain resource that references the WDT model image and the WDT config map.\n+  - Deploying the model image, domain resource, model config map, and associated secrets that define user names, passwords, and URL values for the model and its domain resource.\n+  - Deploying and accessing a Traefik load balancer that redirects HTTP protocol calls to its Java EE servlet application.\n+\n+Supported domain types:\n+\n+There are three types of domains supported by Model in Image: a standard `WLS` domain, an Oracle Fusion Middleware Infrastructure Java Required Files (`JRF`) domain, or a `RestrictedJRF` domain.\n+\n+The `JRF` domain path through the sample includes additional steps for deploying an infrastructure database and initializing the database using the Repository Creation Utility (RCU) tool. `JRF` domains may be  used by Oracle products that layer on top of WebLogic Server such as SOA and OSB. Similarly, `RestrictedJRF` domains may be used by Oracle layered products such as Oracle Communications products.\n+\n+### References\n+\n+To reference the relevant user documentation, see:\n+ - [Model in Image User Guide]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) user documentation\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Server Deploy Tooling](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling)\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool)\n+\n+\n+\n+### Prerequisites for all domain types\n+\n+1. The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable must be set and must reference a valid JDK 8 installation. (`JAVA_HOME` is used by the WebLogic Image Tool.)\n+\n+2. Set a source directory environment variable `SRCDIR` that references the parent of the operator source tree. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   mkdir ~/wlopsrc\n+   cd ~/wlopsrc\n+   git clone https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator.git\n+   export SRCDIR=$(pwd)/weblogic-kubernetes-operator\n+   ```\n+\n+   For additional information about obtaining the operator source, see the [Developer Guide Requirements](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/developerguide/requirements/).\n+\n+3. Create a sample directory environment variable `SAMPLEDIR` that references this sample's directory:\n+\n+   ```\n+   export SAMPLEDIR=${SRCDIR}/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image/\n+   ```\n+\n+4. Create an empty, temporary working directory with 10g of space, and store its location in the `WORKDIR` environment variable. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd <location of empty temporary directory with 10g of space>\n+   export WORKDIR=$(pwd)\n+   ```\n+\n+5. Deploy the operator and set up the operator to manage the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`. Optionally, deploy a Traefik load balancer that manages the same namespace. For example, follow the same steps as the [Quick Start](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/quickstart/), up through the [Prepare for a domain]({{< relref \"/quickstart/prepare.md\" >}}) step.\n+\n+   Note that:\n+   - Deploying the Traefik load balancer is optional, but is a prerequisite for testing the web application that's deployed to WebLogic as part of this sample.\n+   - You can skip the Quick Start steps for obtaining a WebLogic image because you will be creating your own Docker image.\n+\n+\n+6. Choose the type of domain you're going to create: `WLS`, `JRF`, or `RestrictedJRF`, and set the environment variable, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, accordingly. The default is `WLS`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   export WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE=<one of WLS, JRF, or RestrictedJRF>\n+   ```\n+\n+7. Set up access to a base image for this sample that will be used as the base image for creating the final image. Do one of the following:\n+\n+   - __Option 1, download an existing WebLogic image.__\n+\n+     Set up access to this sample's base WebLogic image at the [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com):\n+\n+     a. Use a browser to access [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com).\n+\n+     b. Choose an image location:\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF` domains, select `Middleware`, then `fmw-infrastructure`.\n+       - For `WLS` domains, select `Middleware`, then `weblogic`.\n+\n+     c. Select Sign In and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+     d. Use your terminal to locally log in to Docker: `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+\n+     e. Later, when you run the sample, it will call `docker pull` for your base image based on the domain type.\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4`.\n+       - For `WLS`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4`.\n+\n+   - __Option 2, create your own WebLogic base image.__\n+\n+     Alternatively, you can create your own base image and override the sample's default base image name and tag by exporting the `BASE_IMAGE_NAME` and `BASE_IMAGE_TAG` environment variables prior to running the sample scripts. If you want to create your own base image, see [Preparing a Base Image]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-in-image/base-images/_index.md\" >}}).\n+\n+8. If you are using a `JRF` domain type, then it requires an RCU infrastructure database. See [Prerequisites for JRF Domains](#prerequisites-for-jrf-domains). You can do this step before or after you create your final image. If you're not using a `JRF` domain type, proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image).\n+\n+### Prerequisites for JRF domains\n+\n+> __NOTE__: This section is only required for demonstrating a `JRF` domain type. Skip this section and proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image) if your domain type is `WLS` or `RestrictedJRF`.\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database called an RCU database, requires initializing this database, and requires configuring your domain to access this database. All of these steps must occur before you first deploy your domain.\n+\n+Furthermore, if you want to have a restarted JRF domain access updates to the infrastructure database that the domain made at an earlier time, the restarted domain must be supplied a wallet file that was obtained from a previous run of the domain.\n+\n+The following steps demonstrate how to set up an infrastructure database that will work with this sample:\n+\n+  1. [Set up and initialize an RCU database](#set-up-and-initialize-an-rcu-database).\n+  2. [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout).\n+  3. [Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets](#set-up-rcu-model-attributes-domain-resource-attributes-and-secrets).\n+  4. [Reusing or sharing RCU tables](#reusing-or-sharing-rcu-tables).\n+\n+\n+\n+##### Set up and initialize an RCU database\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database and also requires initializing this database with a schema and a set of tables. The following example shows how to set up a sample RCU database and use the RCU tool to create the infrastructure schema for a JRF domain. The RCU database is set up with the following attributes:\n+\n+| Attribute | Value |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| database Kubernetes namespace | `default` |\n+| database Kubernetes pod | `oracle-db` |\n+| database image | `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` |\n+| database password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| infrastructure schema prefix | `FMW1` |\n+| infrastructure schema password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| database URL | `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s` |\n+\n+\n+1. Ensure you have access to the database image, and then deploy it:\n+\n+   - Use a browser to log in to `https://container-registry.oracle.com`, select `database->enterprise` and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+   - Get the database image:\n+     - In the local shell, `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+     - In the local shell, `docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim`.\n+\n+\n+       {{% notice note %}} If a local Docker login and manual pull of `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` is not sufficient (for example, if you are using a remote Kubernetes cluster), then uncomment the `imagePullSecrets` stanza in `$WORKDIR/k8s-db-slim.yaml` and create the image pull secret as follows:\n+\n+              ```\n+              kubectl create secret docker-registry regsecret \\\n+                --docker-server=container-registry.oracle.com \\\n+                --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+                --docker-password=your-password \\\n+                --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+              ```\n+       {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+\n+   - Use the sample script in `$SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service` to create an Oracle database running in the pod, `oracle-db`.\n+\n+      **NOTE**: If your database image access requires the `regsecret` image pull secret that you optionally created above, then pass `-s regsecret` to the `start-db-service.sh` command line.\n+\n+     ```\n+     cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service\n+     start-db-service.sh\n+     ```\n+\n+     This script will deploy a database with the URL, `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`, and administration password, `Oradoc_db1`.\n+\n+     {{% notice warning %}} The Oracle database Docker images are supported only for non-production use. For more details, see My Oracle Support note: Oracle Support for Database Running on Docker (Doc ID 2216342.1) : All the data is gone when the database is restarted.\n+     {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+     **NOTE**: This step is based on the steps documented in [Run a Database](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/userguide/overview/database/).\n+\n+2. Use the sample script in `SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema` to create the RCU schema with the schema prefix `FMW1`.\n+\n+   Note that this script assumes `Oradoc_db1` is the DBA password, `Oradoc_db1` is the schema password, and that the database URL is `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema\n+   ./create-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1 -i container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4\n+   ```\n+\n+   __NOTE__:  If you need to drop the repository, use this command:\n+\n+   ```\n+   drop-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1\n+   ```\n+\n+\n+##### Increase introspection job timeout\n+\n+Because JRF domain home creation takes a considerable amount of time the first time it is created, and because Model in Image creates your domain home for you using the introspection job, you should increase the timeout for the introspection job. Use the `configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds` in `k8s-domain.yaml.template` to override the default with a value of at least 300 seconds (the default is 120 seconds).  \n+\n+##### Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets\n+\n+To allow Model in Image to access the RCU database and OPSS wallet, it's necessary to set up an RCU access secret and an OPSS secret before deploying your domain. It's also necessary to define an `RCUDbInfo` stanza in your model. The sample already sets up all of these for you.  See:\n+\n+| Sample file | Description |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, with `password=welcome1`. |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, with appropriate values for attributes `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string`. |\n+| `model1.yaml.jrf` | Populates the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string` attributes by referencing their locations in the `sample-domain1-rcu-access` secret. The `build.sh` script uses this model instead of `model.yaml.wls` when the source domain type is `JRF`. |\n+| `k8s-domain.yaml.template` | Ensures that the domain mounts the OPSS key secret by setting the domain resource `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` attribute to `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, and ensures the domain mounts the RCU access secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, for reference by WDT model macros by setting the domain resource `configuration.secrets` attribute. Use configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds to increase the timeout value of the introspector job; see [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout). |\n+\n+ **NOTE**: This step is for information purposes only. Do not run the above sample files directly. The sample's main build and run scripts will run them for you.\n+\n+##### Reusing or sharing RCU tables\n+\n+Note that when you succesfully deploy your JRF domain resource for the first time, the introspector job will initialize the RCU tables for the domain using the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza in the WDT model plus the `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` specified in the domain resource. The job will also create a new domain home. Finally, the operator will also capture an OPSS wallet file from the new domain's local directory and place this file in a new Kubernetes config map.\n+\n+There are scenarios when the domain needs to be re-created between updates such as WebLogic credentials are changed, security roles defined in the WDT model have been changed or you want to share the same RCU tables with different domains.  Under these scenarios, the operator needs the `walletPasswordSecret` as well as the OPSS wallet file, together with the exact information in `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` so that the domain can be re-created and access the same set of RCU tables.  Without the wallet file and wallet password, you will not be able to re-create a domain accessing the same set of RCU tables, therefore it is highly recommended to backup the wallet file.\n+\n+To recover a domain's RCU tables between domain restarts or to share an RCU schema between different domains, it is necessary to extract this wallet file from the config map and save the OPSS wallet password secret that was used for the original domain. The wallet password and wallet file are needed again when you recreate the domain or share the database with other domains.\n+\n+To save the wallet file:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -s [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>]\n+```\n+\n+You should back up this file to a safe location that can be retrieved later.\n+\n+To reuse the wallet for subsequent redeployments or share the RCU tables between different domains:\n+\n+1. Store the wallet in a secret:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -r [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>] [-ws <name of the secret. Default DOMAIN_UID-opss-walletfile-secret> ]\n+\n+```\n+\n+2. Modify the domain resource YAML file to provide the secret names:\n+\n+```\n+  configuration:\n+    opss:\n+      # Name of secret with walletPassword for extracting the wallet\n+      walletPasswordSecret: sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret      \n+      # Name of secret with walletFile containing base64 encoded opss wallet\n+      walletFileSecret: sample-domain1-opss-walletfile-secret\n+\n+```\n+\n+See [Reusing an RCU database]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/reusing-rcu.md\" >}}) for instructions.\n+\n+### Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image\n+\n+Model in Image must contain a WebLogic install, a WebLogic Deploy Tool install, and your WDT model files. You can use the sample `./build.sh` script to build this image, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Uses `docker pull` to obtain a base image. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types) to set up access to the base image.)\n+  - Downloads the latest WebLogic Image Tool and WebLogic Deploy Tool to `WORKDIR`.\n+  - Creates and populates a staging directory `$WORKDIR/models` that contains your WDT model files and WDT application archive.\n+    - Builds  a simple servlet application in `$SAMPLEDIR/sample_app` into a WDT model application archive `$WORKDIR/models/archive1.zip`.\n+    - Copies sample model files from `$SAMPLEDIR/model-in-image` to `$WORKDIR/models`. This uses a model file that is appropriate to the domain type (for example, the `JRF` domain model includes database access configuration).\n+  - Uses the WebLogic Image Tool and the `$WORKDIR/models` staging directory to create a final image named `model-in-image:v1` that layers on the base image. Specifically, it runs the WebLogic Image Tool with its `update` option, which:\n+    - Builds the final image as a layer on the base image.\n+    - Puts a WDT install in image location, `/u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy`.\n+    - Copies the WDT model, properties, and application archive from `$WORDKIR/models` to image location, `/u01/wdt/models`.\n+\n+The script expects `JAVA_HOME`, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).)\n+\n+Run the script:\n+\n+  ```\n+  $SAMPLEDIR/build.sh\n+  ```\n+\n+If you intend to use a remote Docker registry, you need to tag and push the image to the remote Docker registry.\n+\n+1.  Tag the image for the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker tag <image-name>:<tag> <region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>:<tag>\n+```\n+\n+2.  Push the image to the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker push <region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>:<tag>\n+```\n+\n+3. Create the pull secret for the remote Docker registry:\n+\n+```\n+ kubectl -n <domain namespace> create secret docker-registry <secret name> \\\n+     --docker-server=<region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name> \\\n+     --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+     --docker-password=your-password \\\n+     --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+\n+```\n+\n+4. Update the domain template file `$SAMPLEDIR/k8s-domain.yaml.template` to provide the `imagePullSecrets`:\n+\n+```\n+  imagePullSecrets:\n+  - name: <secret name>\n+\n+```\n+\n+5. Export the environment variables for the image name and tag using the same values in step 1:\n+\n+```\n+export MODEL_IMAGE_NAME=\"<region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>\"\n+export MODEL_IMAGE_TAG=\"<tag>\"\n+```\n+\n+### Create and deploy your Kubernetes resources\n+\n+To deploy the sample operator domain and its required Kubernetes resources, use the sample script, `$SAMPLEDIR/run_domain.sh`, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Deletes the domain with a `DomainUID` of `domain1` in the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`, if it already exists.\n+  - Creates a secret containing your WebLogic administrator user name and password.\n+  - Creates a secret containing your Model in Image runtime encryption password:\n+    - All model-in-image domains must supply a runtime encryption secret with a `password` value.\n+    - It is used to encrypt configuration that is passed around internally by the Operator.\n+    - The value must be kept private but can be arbitrary: you can optionally supply a different secret value every time you restart the domain.\n+  - Creates secrets containing your RCU access URL, credentials, and prefix (these are unused unless the domain type is `JRF`).\n+  - Creates a config map containing an additional WDT model properties file, `$SAMPLEDIR/model1.20.properties`.\n+  - Generates a domain resource YAML file, `$WORKDIR/k8s-domain.yaml`, using `$SAMPLEDIR/k8s-domain.yaml.template`.\n+  - Deploys `k8s-domain.yaml`.\n+  - Displays the status of the domain pods.\n+\n+The script expects `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE` and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).)\n+\n+Run the script:\n+\n+  ```\n+  $SAMPLEDIR/run_domain.sh\n+  ```\n+\n+At the end, you will see the message `Getting pod status - ctrl-c when all is running and ready to exit`. Then you should see a WebLogic Administration Server and two Managed Server pods start. After all the pods are up, you can use `ctrl-c` to exit the build script.\n+", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5NjY4MjA1OA=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "3f46823be21e32c4b54a101d5590aeb40dbcdb15"}, "originalPosition": 344}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMjQ1OTAzOTU3OnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "docs-source/content/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md", "isResolved": true, "comments": {"totalCount": 3, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMy0yM1QxODo1MjozN1rOF6Tk6A==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMy0yNFQyMzoxNzozMFrOF7Gnug==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5NjY4MjQ3Mg==", "bodyText": "We're not going to support Helm 2.x with operator 3.0.0.", "url": "https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/pull/1478#discussion_r396682472", "createdAt": "2020-03-23T18:52:37Z", "author": {"login": "rjeberhard"}, "path": "docs-source/content/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,520 @@\n+---\n+title: \"Model in image\"\n+date: 2019-02-23T17:32:31-05:00\n+weight: 4\n+description: \"Sample for supplying a WebLogic Deploy Tool (WDT) model that the operator automatically expands into a full domain home during runtime.\"\n+---\n+\n+### Contents\n+\n+  - [Introduction](#introduction)\n+  - [References](#references)\n+  - [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types)\n+  - [Prerequisites for JRF domains](#prerequisites-for-jrf-domains)\n+    - [Set Up and Initialize an RCU Database](#set-up-and-initialize-an-rcu-database)\n+    - [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout)\n+    - [Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets](#set-up-rcu-model-attributes-domain-resource-attributes-and-secrets)\n+    - [Reusing or sharing RCU tables](#reusing-or-sharing-rcu-tables)\n+  - [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image)\n+  - [Create and deploy your Kubernetes resources](#create-and-deploy-your-kubernetes-resources)\n+  - [Optionally test the sample application](#optionally-test-the-sample-application)\n+  - [Optionally access the WebLogic console](#optionally-access-the-weblogic-console)\n+  - [Cleanup](#cleanup)\n+\n+### Introduction\n+\n+This sample demonstrates:\n+\n+  - Using the WebLogic Image Tool to create a Docker image that contains a WebLogic install, a WebLogic Deploy Tool (WDT) install, a Java EE servlet application contained within a WDT archive, and a WebLogic domain that's defined using a WDT model file.\n+  - Modifying the WDT model that's embedded within the Docker image using a WDT model file that's supplied using a Kubernetes config map.\n+  - Defining a `domainHomeSourceType: FromModel` domain resource that references the WDT model image and the WDT config map.\n+  - Deploying the model image, domain resource, model config map, and associated secrets that define user names, passwords, and URL values for the model and its domain resource.\n+  - Deploying and accessing a Traefik load balancer that redirects HTTP protocol calls to its Java EE servlet application.\n+\n+Supported domain types:\n+\n+There are three types of domains supported by Model in Image: a standard `WLS` domain, an Oracle Fusion Middleware Infrastructure Java Required Files (`JRF`) domain, or a `RestrictedJRF` domain.\n+\n+The `JRF` domain path through the sample includes additional steps for deploying an infrastructure database and initializing the database using the Repository Creation Utility (RCU) tool. `JRF` domains may be  used by Oracle products that layer on top of WebLogic Server such as SOA and OSB. Similarly, `RestrictedJRF` domains may be used by Oracle layered products such as Oracle Communications products.\n+\n+### References\n+\n+To reference the relevant user documentation, see:\n+ - [Model in Image User Guide]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) user documentation\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Server Deploy Tooling](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling)\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool)\n+\n+\n+\n+### Prerequisites for all domain types\n+\n+1. The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable must be set and must reference a valid JDK 8 installation. (`JAVA_HOME` is used by the WebLogic Image Tool.)\n+\n+2. Set a source directory environment variable `SRCDIR` that references the parent of the operator source tree. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   mkdir ~/wlopsrc\n+   cd ~/wlopsrc\n+   git clone https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator.git\n+   export SRCDIR=$(pwd)/weblogic-kubernetes-operator\n+   ```\n+\n+   For additional information about obtaining the operator source, see the [Developer Guide Requirements](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/developerguide/requirements/).\n+\n+3. Create a sample directory environment variable `SAMPLEDIR` that references this sample's directory:\n+\n+   ```\n+   export SAMPLEDIR=${SRCDIR}/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image/\n+   ```\n+\n+4. Create an empty, temporary working directory with 10g of space, and store its location in the `WORKDIR` environment variable. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd <location of empty temporary directory with 10g of space>\n+   export WORKDIR=$(pwd)\n+   ```\n+\n+5. Deploy the operator and set up the operator to manage the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`. Optionally, deploy a Traefik load balancer that manages the same namespace. For example, follow the same steps as the [Quick Start](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/quickstart/), up through the [Prepare for a domain]({{< relref \"/quickstart/prepare.md\" >}}) step.\n+\n+   Note that:\n+   - Deploying the Traefik load balancer is optional, but is a prerequisite for testing the web application that's deployed to WebLogic as part of this sample.\n+   - You can skip the Quick Start steps for obtaining a WebLogic image because you will be creating your own Docker image.\n+\n+\n+6. Choose the type of domain you're going to create: `WLS`, `JRF`, or `RestrictedJRF`, and set the environment variable, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, accordingly. The default is `WLS`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   export WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE=<one of WLS, JRF, or RestrictedJRF>\n+   ```\n+\n+7. Set up access to a base image for this sample that will be used as the base image for creating the final image. Do one of the following:\n+\n+   - __Option 1, download an existing WebLogic image.__\n+\n+     Set up access to this sample's base WebLogic image at the [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com):\n+\n+     a. Use a browser to access [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com).\n+\n+     b. Choose an image location:\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF` domains, select `Middleware`, then `fmw-infrastructure`.\n+       - For `WLS` domains, select `Middleware`, then `weblogic`.\n+\n+     c. Select Sign In and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+     d. Use your terminal to locally log in to Docker: `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+\n+     e. Later, when you run the sample, it will call `docker pull` for your base image based on the domain type.\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4`.\n+       - For `WLS`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4`.\n+\n+   - __Option 2, create your own WebLogic base image.__\n+\n+     Alternatively, you can create your own base image and override the sample's default base image name and tag by exporting the `BASE_IMAGE_NAME` and `BASE_IMAGE_TAG` environment variables prior to running the sample scripts. If you want to create your own base image, see [Preparing a Base Image]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-in-image/base-images/_index.md\" >}}).\n+\n+8. If you are using a `JRF` domain type, then it requires an RCU infrastructure database. See [Prerequisites for JRF Domains](#prerequisites-for-jrf-domains). You can do this step before or after you create your final image. If you're not using a `JRF` domain type, proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image).\n+\n+### Prerequisites for JRF domains\n+\n+> __NOTE__: This section is only required for demonstrating a `JRF` domain type. Skip this section and proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image) if your domain type is `WLS` or `RestrictedJRF`.\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database called an RCU database, requires initializing this database, and requires configuring your domain to access this database. All of these steps must occur before you first deploy your domain.\n+\n+Furthermore, if you want to have a restarted JRF domain access updates to the infrastructure database that the domain made at an earlier time, the restarted domain must be supplied a wallet file that was obtained from a previous run of the domain.\n+\n+The following steps demonstrate how to set up an infrastructure database that will work with this sample:\n+\n+  1. [Set up and initialize an RCU database](#set-up-and-initialize-an-rcu-database).\n+  2. [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout).\n+  3. [Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets](#set-up-rcu-model-attributes-domain-resource-attributes-and-secrets).\n+  4. [Reusing or sharing RCU tables](#reusing-or-sharing-rcu-tables).\n+\n+\n+\n+##### Set up and initialize an RCU database\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database and also requires initializing this database with a schema and a set of tables. The following example shows how to set up a sample RCU database and use the RCU tool to create the infrastructure schema for a JRF domain. The RCU database is set up with the following attributes:\n+\n+| Attribute | Value |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| database Kubernetes namespace | `default` |\n+| database Kubernetes pod | `oracle-db` |\n+| database image | `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` |\n+| database password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| infrastructure schema prefix | `FMW1` |\n+| infrastructure schema password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| database URL | `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s` |\n+\n+\n+1. Ensure you have access to the database image, and then deploy it:\n+\n+   - Use a browser to log in to `https://container-registry.oracle.com`, select `database->enterprise` and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+   - Get the database image:\n+     - In the local shell, `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+     - In the local shell, `docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim`.\n+\n+\n+       {{% notice note %}} If a local Docker login and manual pull of `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` is not sufficient (for example, if you are using a remote Kubernetes cluster), then uncomment the `imagePullSecrets` stanza in `$WORKDIR/k8s-db-slim.yaml` and create the image pull secret as follows:\n+\n+              ```\n+              kubectl create secret docker-registry regsecret \\\n+                --docker-server=container-registry.oracle.com \\\n+                --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+                --docker-password=your-password \\\n+                --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+              ```\n+       {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+\n+   - Use the sample script in `$SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service` to create an Oracle database running in the pod, `oracle-db`.\n+\n+      **NOTE**: If your database image access requires the `regsecret` image pull secret that you optionally created above, then pass `-s regsecret` to the `start-db-service.sh` command line.\n+\n+     ```\n+     cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service\n+     start-db-service.sh\n+     ```\n+\n+     This script will deploy a database with the URL, `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`, and administration password, `Oradoc_db1`.\n+\n+     {{% notice warning %}} The Oracle database Docker images are supported only for non-production use. For more details, see My Oracle Support note: Oracle Support for Database Running on Docker (Doc ID 2216342.1) : All the data is gone when the database is restarted.\n+     {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+     **NOTE**: This step is based on the steps documented in [Run a Database](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/userguide/overview/database/).\n+\n+2. Use the sample script in `SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema` to create the RCU schema with the schema prefix `FMW1`.\n+\n+   Note that this script assumes `Oradoc_db1` is the DBA password, `Oradoc_db1` is the schema password, and that the database URL is `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema\n+   ./create-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1 -i container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4\n+   ```\n+\n+   __NOTE__:  If you need to drop the repository, use this command:\n+\n+   ```\n+   drop-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1\n+   ```\n+\n+\n+##### Increase introspection job timeout\n+\n+Because JRF domain home creation takes a considerable amount of time the first time it is created, and because Model in Image creates your domain home for you using the introspection job, you should increase the timeout for the introspection job. Use the `configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds` in `k8s-domain.yaml.template` to override the default with a value of at least 300 seconds (the default is 120 seconds).  \n+\n+##### Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets\n+\n+To allow Model in Image to access the RCU database and OPSS wallet, it's necessary to set up an RCU access secret and an OPSS secret before deploying your domain. It's also necessary to define an `RCUDbInfo` stanza in your model. The sample already sets up all of these for you.  See:\n+\n+| Sample file | Description |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, with `password=welcome1`. |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, with appropriate values for attributes `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string`. |\n+| `model1.yaml.jrf` | Populates the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string` attributes by referencing their locations in the `sample-domain1-rcu-access` secret. The `build.sh` script uses this model instead of `model.yaml.wls` when the source domain type is `JRF`. |\n+| `k8s-domain.yaml.template` | Ensures that the domain mounts the OPSS key secret by setting the domain resource `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` attribute to `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, and ensures the domain mounts the RCU access secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, for reference by WDT model macros by setting the domain resource `configuration.secrets` attribute. Use configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds to increase the timeout value of the introspector job; see [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout). |\n+\n+ **NOTE**: This step is for information purposes only. Do not run the above sample files directly. The sample's main build and run scripts will run them for you.\n+\n+##### Reusing or sharing RCU tables\n+\n+Note that when you succesfully deploy your JRF domain resource for the first time, the introspector job will initialize the RCU tables for the domain using the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza in the WDT model plus the `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` specified in the domain resource. The job will also create a new domain home. Finally, the operator will also capture an OPSS wallet file from the new domain's local directory and place this file in a new Kubernetes config map.\n+\n+There are scenarios when the domain needs to be re-created between updates such as WebLogic credentials are changed, security roles defined in the WDT model have been changed or you want to share the same RCU tables with different domains.  Under these scenarios, the operator needs the `walletPasswordSecret` as well as the OPSS wallet file, together with the exact information in `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` so that the domain can be re-created and access the same set of RCU tables.  Without the wallet file and wallet password, you will not be able to re-create a domain accessing the same set of RCU tables, therefore it is highly recommended to backup the wallet file.\n+\n+To recover a domain's RCU tables between domain restarts or to share an RCU schema between different domains, it is necessary to extract this wallet file from the config map and save the OPSS wallet password secret that was used for the original domain. The wallet password and wallet file are needed again when you recreate the domain or share the database with other domains.\n+\n+To save the wallet file:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -s [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>]\n+```\n+\n+You should back up this file to a safe location that can be retrieved later.\n+\n+To reuse the wallet for subsequent redeployments or share the RCU tables between different domains:\n+\n+1. Store the wallet in a secret:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -r [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>] [-ws <name of the secret. Default DOMAIN_UID-opss-walletfile-secret> ]\n+\n+```\n+\n+2. Modify the domain resource YAML file to provide the secret names:\n+\n+```\n+  configuration:\n+    opss:\n+      # Name of secret with walletPassword for extracting the wallet\n+      walletPasswordSecret: sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret      \n+      # Name of secret with walletFile containing base64 encoded opss wallet\n+      walletFileSecret: sample-domain1-opss-walletfile-secret\n+\n+```\n+\n+See [Reusing an RCU database]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/reusing-rcu.md\" >}}) for instructions.\n+\n+### Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image\n+\n+Model in Image must contain a WebLogic install, a WebLogic Deploy Tool install, and your WDT model files. You can use the sample `./build.sh` script to build this image, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Uses `docker pull` to obtain a base image. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types) to set up access to the base image.)\n+  - Downloads the latest WebLogic Image Tool and WebLogic Deploy Tool to `WORKDIR`.\n+  - Creates and populates a staging directory `$WORKDIR/models` that contains your WDT model files and WDT application archive.\n+    - Builds  a simple servlet application in `$SAMPLEDIR/sample_app` into a WDT model application archive `$WORKDIR/models/archive1.zip`.\n+    - Copies sample model files from `$SAMPLEDIR/model-in-image` to `$WORKDIR/models`. This uses a model file that is appropriate to the domain type (for example, the `JRF` domain model includes database access configuration).\n+  - Uses the WebLogic Image Tool and the `$WORKDIR/models` staging directory to create a final image named `model-in-image:v1` that layers on the base image. Specifically, it runs the WebLogic Image Tool with its `update` option, which:\n+    - Builds the final image as a layer on the base image.\n+    - Puts a WDT install in image location, `/u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy`.\n+    - Copies the WDT model, properties, and application archive from `$WORDKIR/models` to image location, `/u01/wdt/models`.\n+\n+The script expects `JAVA_HOME`, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).)\n+\n+Run the script:\n+\n+  ```\n+  $SAMPLEDIR/build.sh\n+  ```\n+\n+If you intend to use a remote Docker registry, you need to tag and push the image to the remote Docker registry.\n+\n+1.  Tag the image for the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker tag <image-name>:<tag> <region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>:<tag>\n+```\n+\n+2.  Push the image to the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker push <region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>:<tag>\n+```\n+\n+3. Create the pull secret for the remote Docker registry:\n+\n+```\n+ kubectl -n <domain namespace> create secret docker-registry <secret name> \\\n+     --docker-server=<region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name> \\\n+     --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+     --docker-password=your-password \\\n+     --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+\n+```\n+\n+4. Update the domain template file `$SAMPLEDIR/k8s-domain.yaml.template` to provide the `imagePullSecrets`:\n+\n+```\n+  imagePullSecrets:\n+  - name: <secret name>\n+\n+```\n+\n+5. Export the environment variables for the image name and tag using the same values in step 1:\n+\n+```\n+export MODEL_IMAGE_NAME=\"<region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>\"\n+export MODEL_IMAGE_TAG=\"<tag>\"\n+```\n+\n+### Create and deploy your Kubernetes resources\n+\n+To deploy the sample operator domain and its required Kubernetes resources, use the sample script, `$SAMPLEDIR/run_domain.sh`, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Deletes the domain with a `DomainUID` of `domain1` in the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`, if it already exists.\n+  - Creates a secret containing your WebLogic administrator user name and password.\n+  - Creates a secret containing your Model in Image runtime encryption password:\n+    - All model-in-image domains must supply a runtime encryption secret with a `password` value.\n+    - It is used to encrypt configuration that is passed around internally by the Operator.\n+    - The value must be kept private but can be arbitrary: you can optionally supply a different secret value every time you restart the domain.\n+  - Creates secrets containing your RCU access URL, credentials, and prefix (these are unused unless the domain type is `JRF`).\n+  - Creates a config map containing an additional WDT model properties file, `$SAMPLEDIR/model1.20.properties`.\n+  - Generates a domain resource YAML file, `$WORKDIR/k8s-domain.yaml`, using `$SAMPLEDIR/k8s-domain.yaml.template`.\n+  - Deploys `k8s-domain.yaml`.\n+  - Displays the status of the domain pods.\n+\n+The script expects `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE` and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).)\n+\n+Run the script:\n+\n+  ```\n+  $SAMPLEDIR/run_domain.sh\n+  ```\n+\n+At the end, you will see the message `Getting pod status - ctrl-c when all is running and ready to exit`. Then you should see a WebLogic Administration Server and two Managed Server pods start. After all the pods are up, you can use `ctrl-c` to exit the build script.\n+\n+\n+### Optionally test the sample application\n+\n+1. Ensure Traefik has been installed and is servicing external port 30305, as per [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).\n+\n+2.

Similarly, `RestrictedJRF` domains may be used by Oracle layered products such as Oracle Communications products.\n+\n+### References\n+\n+To reference the relevant user documentation, see:\n+ - [Model in Image User Guide]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) user documentation\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Server Deploy Tooling](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling)\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool)\n+\n+\n+\n+### Prerequisites for all domain types\n+\n+1. The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable must be set and must reference a valid JDK 8 installation. (`JAVA_HOME` is used by the WebLogic Image Tool.)\n+\n+2. Set a source directory environment variable `SRCDIR` that references the parent of the operator source tree. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   mkdir ~/wlopsrc\n+   cd ~/wlopsrc\n+   git clone https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator.git\n+   export SRCDIR=$(pwd)/weblogic-kubernetes-operator\n+   ```\n+\n+   For additional information about obtaining the operator source, see the [Developer Guide Requirements](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/developerguide/requirements/).\n+\n+3. Create a sample directory environment variable `SAMPLEDIR` that references this sample's directory:\n+\n+   ```\n+   export SAMPLEDIR=${SRCDIR}/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image/\n+   ```\n+\n+4. Create an empty, temporary working directory with 10g of space, and store its location in the `WORKDIR` environment variable. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd <location of empty temporary directory with 10g of space>\n+   export WORKDIR=$(pwd)\n+   ```\n+\n+5. Deploy the operator and set up the operator to manage the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`. Optionally, deploy a Traefik load balancer that manages the same namespace. For example, follow the same steps as the [Quick Start](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/quickstart/), up through the [Prepare for a domain]({{< relref \"/quickstart/prepare.md\" >}}) step.\n+\n+   Note that:\n+   - Deploying the Traefik load balancer is optional, but is a prerequisite for testing the web application that's deployed to WebLogic as part of this sample.\n+   - You can skip the Quick Start steps for obtaining a WebLogic image because you will be creating your own Docker image.\n+\n+\n+6. Choose the type of domain you're going to create: `WLS`, `JRF`, or `RestrictedJRF`, and set the environment variable, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, accordingly. The default is `WLS`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   export WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE=<one of WLS, JRF, or RestrictedJRF>\n+   ```\n+\n+7. Set up access to a base image for this sample that will be used as the base image for creating the final image. Do one of the following:\n+\n+   - __Option 1, download an existing WebLogic image.__\n+\n+     Set up access to this sample's base WebLogic image at the [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com):\n+\n+     a. Use a browser to access [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com).\n+\n+     b. Choose an image location:\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF` domains, select `Middleware`, then `fmw-infrastructure`.\n+       - For `WLS` domains, select `Middleware`, then `weblogic`.\n+\n+     c. Select Sign In and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+     d. Use your terminal to locally log in to Docker: `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+\n+     e. Later, when you run the sample, it will call `docker pull` for your base image based on the domain type.\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4`.\n+       - For `WLS`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4`.\n+\n+   - __Option 2, create your own WebLogic base image.__\n+\n+     Alternatively, you can create your own base image and override the sample's default base image name and tag by exporting the `BASE_IMAGE_NAME` and `BASE_IMAGE_TAG` environment variables prior to running the sample scripts. If you want to create your own base image, see [Preparing a Base Image]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-in-image/base-images/_index.md\" >}}).\n+\n+8. If you are using a `JRF` domain type, then it requires an RCU infrastructure database. See [Prerequisites for JRF Domains](#prerequisites-for-jrf-domains). You can do this step before or after you create your final image. If you're not using a `JRF` domain type, proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image).\n+\n+### Prerequisites for JRF domains\n+\n+> __NOTE__: This section is only required for demonstrating a `JRF` domain type. Skip this section and proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image) if your domain type is `WLS` or `RestrictedJRF`.\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database called an RCU database, requires initializing this database, and requires configuring your domain to access this database. All of these steps must occur before you first deploy your domain.\n+\n+Furthermore, if you want to have a restarted JRF domain access updates to the infrastructure database that the domain made at an earlier time, the restarted domain must be supplied a wallet file that was obtained from a previous run of the domain.\n+\n+The following steps demonstrate how to set up an infrastructure database that will work with this sample:\n+\n+  1. [Set up and initialize an RCU database](#set-up-and-initialize-an-rcu-database).\n+  2. [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout).\n+  3. [Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets](#set-up-rcu-model-attributes-domain-resource-attributes-and-secrets).\n+  4. [Reusing or sharing RCU tables](#reusing-or-sharing-rcu-tables).\n+\n+\n+\n+##### Set up and initialize an RCU database\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database and also requires initializing this database with a schema and a set of tables. The following example shows how to set up a sample RCU database and use the RCU tool to create the infrastructure schema for a JRF domain. The RCU database is set up with the following attributes:\n+\n+| Attribute | Value |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| database Kubernetes namespace | `default` |\n+| database Kubernetes pod | `oracle-db` |\n+| database image | `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` |\n+| database password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| infrastructure schema prefix | `FMW1` |\n+| infrastructure schema password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| database URL | `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s` |\n+\n+\n+1. Ensure you have access to the database image, and then deploy it:\n+\n+   - Use a browser to log in to `https://container-registry.oracle.com`, select `database->enterprise` and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+   - Get the database image:\n+     - In the local shell, `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+     - In the local shell, `docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim`.\n+\n+\n+       {{% notice note %}} If a local Docker login and manual pull of `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` is not sufficient (for example, if you are using a remote Kubernetes cluster), then uncomment the `imagePullSecrets` stanza in `$WORKDIR/k8s-db-slim.yaml` and create the image pull secret as follows:\n+\n+              ```\n+              kubectl create secret docker-registry regsecret \\\n+                --docker-server=container-registry.oracle.com \\\n+                --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+                --docker-password=your-password \\\n+                --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+              ```\n+       {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+\n+   - Use the sample script in `$SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service` to create an Oracle database running in the pod, `oracle-db`.\n+\n+      **NOTE**: If your database image access requires the `regsecret` image pull secret that you optionally created above, then pass `-s regsecret` to the `start-db-service.sh` command line.\n+\n+     ```\n+     cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service\n+     start-db-service.sh\n+     ```\n+\n+     This script will deploy a database with the URL, `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`, and administration password, `Oradoc_db1`.\n+\n+     {{% notice warning %}} The Oracle database Docker images are supported only for non-production use. For more details, see My Oracle Support note: Oracle Support for Database Running on Docker (Doc ID 2216342.1) : All the data is gone when the database is restarted.\n+     {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+     **NOTE**: This step is based on the steps documented in [Run a Database](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/userguide/overview/database/).\n+\n+2. Use the sample script in `SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema` to create the RCU schema with the schema prefix `FMW1`.\n+\n+   Note that this script assumes `Oradoc_db1` is the DBA password, `Oradoc_db1` is the schema password, and that the database URL is `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema\n+   ./create-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1 -i container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4\n+   ```\n+\n+   __NOTE__:  If you need to drop the repository, use this command:\n+\n+   ```\n+   drop-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1\n+   ```\n+\n+\n+##### Increase introspection job timeout\n+\n+Because JRF domain home creation takes a considerable amount of time the first time it is created, and because Model in Image creates your domain home for you using the introspection job, you should increase the timeout for the introspection job. Use the `configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds` in `k8s-domain.yaml.template` to override the default with a value of at least 300 seconds (the default is 120 seconds).  \n+\n+##### Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets\n+\n+To allow Model in Image to access the RCU database and OPSS wallet, it's necessary to set up an RCU access secret and an OPSS secret before deploying your domain. It's also necessary to define an `RCUDbInfo` stanza in your model. The sample already sets up all of these for you.  See:\n+\n+| Sample file | Description |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, with `password=welcome1`. |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, with appropriate values for attributes `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string`. |\n+| `model1.yaml.jrf` | Populates the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string` attributes by referencing their locations in the `sample-domain1-rcu-access` secret. The `build.sh` script uses this model instead of `model.yaml.wls` when the source domain type is `JRF`. |\n+| `k8s-domain.yaml.template` | Ensures that the domain mounts the OPSS key secret by setting the domain resource `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` attribute to `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, and ensures the domain mounts the RCU access secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, for reference by WDT model macros by setting the domain resource `configuration.secrets` attribute. Use configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds to increase the timeout value of the introspector job; see [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout). |\n+\n+ **NOTE**: This step is for information purposes only. Do not run the above sample files directly. The sample's main build and run scripts will run them for you.\n+\n+##### Reusing or sharing RCU tables\n+\n+Note that when you succesfully deploy your JRF domain resource for the first time, the introspector job will initialize the RCU tables for the domain using the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza in the WDT model plus the `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` specified in the domain resource. The job will also create a new domain home. Finally, the operator will also capture an OPSS wallet file from the new domain's local directory and place this file in a new Kubernetes config map.\n+\n+There are scenarios when the domain needs to be re-created between updates such as WebLogic credentials are changed, security roles defined in the WDT model have been changed or you want to share the same RCU tables with different domains.  Under these scenarios, the operator needs the `walletPasswordSecret` as well as the OPSS wallet file, together with the exact information in `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` so that the domain can be re-created and access the same set of RCU tables.  Without the wallet file and wallet password, you will not be able to re-create a domain accessing the same set of RCU tables, therefore it is highly recommended to backup the wallet file.\n+\n+To recover a domain's RCU tables between domain restarts or to share an RCU schema between different domains, it is necessary to extract this wallet file from the config map and save the OPSS wallet password secret that was used for the original domain. The wallet password and wallet file are needed again when you recreate the domain or share the database with other domains.\n+\n+To save the wallet file:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -s [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>]\n+```\n+\n+You should back up this file to a safe location that can be retrieved later.\n+\n+To reuse the wallet for subsequent redeployments or share the RCU tables between different domains:\n+\n+1. Store the wallet in a secret:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -r [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>] [-ws <name of the secret. Default DOMAIN_UID-opss-walletfile-secret> ]\n+\n+```\n+\n+2. Modify the domain resource YAML file to provide the secret names:\n+\n+```\n+  configuration:\n+    opss:\n+      # Name of secret with walletPassword for extracting the wallet\n+      walletPasswordSecret: sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret      \n+      # Name of secret with walletFile containing base64 encoded opss wallet\n+      walletFileSecret: sample-domain1-opss-walletfile-secret\n+\n+```\n+\n+See [Reusing an RCU database]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/reusing-rcu.md\" >}}) for instructions.\n+\n+### Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image\n+\n+Model in Image must contain a WebLogic install, a WebLogic Deploy Tool install, and your WDT model files. You can use the sample `./build.sh` script to build this image, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Uses `docker pull` to obtain a base image. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types) to set up access to the base image.)\n+  - Downloads the latest WebLogic Image Tool and WebLogic Deploy Tool to `WORKDIR`.\n+  - Creates and populates a staging directory `$WORKDIR/models` that contains your WDT model files and WDT application archive.\n+    - Builds  a simple servlet application in `$SAMPLEDIR/sample_app` into a WDT model application archive `$WORKDIR/models/archive1.zip`.\n+    - Copies sample model files from `$SAMPLEDIR/model-in-image` to `$WORKDIR/models`. This uses a model file that is appropriate to the domain type (for example, the `JRF` domain model includes database access configuration).\n+  - Uses the WebLogic Image Tool and the `$WORKDIR/models` staging directory to create a final image named `model-in-image:v1` that layers on the base image. Specifically, it runs the WebLogic Image Tool with its `update` option, which:\n+    - Builds the final image as a layer on the base image.\n+    - Puts a WDT install in image location, `/u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy`.\n+    - Copies the WDT model, properties, and application archive from `$WORDKIR/models` to image location, `/u01/wdt/models`.\n+\n+The script expects `JAVA_HOME`, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).)\n+\n+Run the script:\n+\n+  ```\n+  $SAMPLEDIR/build.sh\n+  ```\n+\n+If you intend to use a remote Docker registry, you need to tag and push the image to the remote Docker registry.\n+\n+1.  Tag the image for the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker tag <image-name>:<tag> <region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>:<tag>\n+```\n+\n+2.  Push the image to the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker push <region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>:<tag>\n+```\n+\n+3. Create the pull secret for the remote Docker registry:\n+\n+```\n+ kubectl -n <domain namespace> create secret docker-registry <secret name> \\\n+     --docker-server=<region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name> \\\n+     --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+     --docker-password=your-password \\\n+     --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+\n+```\n+\n+4. Update the domain template file `$SAMPLEDIR/k8s-domain.yaml.template` to provide the `imagePullSecrets`:\n+\n+```\n+  imagePullSecrets:\n+  - name: <secret name>\n+\n+```\n+\n+5. Export the environment variables for the image name and tag using the same values in step 1:\n+\n+```\n+export MODEL_IMAGE_NAME=\"<region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>\"\n+export MODEL_IMAGE_TAG=\"<tag>\"\n+```\n+\n+### Create and deploy your Kubernetes resources\n+\n+To deploy the sample operator domain and its required Kubernetes resources, use the sample script, `$SAMPLEDIR/run_domain.sh`, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Deletes the domain with a `DomainUID` of `domain1` in the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`, if it already exists.\n+  - Creates a secret containing your WebLogic administrator user name and password.\n+  - Creates a secret containing your Model in Image runtime encryption password:\n+    - All model-in-image domains must supply a runtime encryption secret with a `password` value.\n+    - It is used to encrypt configuration that is passed around internally by the Operator.\n+    - The value must be kept private but can be arbitrary: you can optionally supply a different secret value every time you restart the domain.\n+  - Creates secrets containing your RCU access URL, credentials, and prefix (these are unused unless the domain type is `JRF`).\n+  - Creates a config map containing an additional WDT model properties file, `$SAMPLEDIR/model1.20.properties`.\n+  - Generates a domain resource YAML file, `$WORKDIR/k8s-domain.yaml`, using `$SAMPLEDIR/k8s-domain.yaml.template`.\n+  - Deploys `k8s-domain.yaml`.\n+  - Displays the status of the domain pods.\n+\n+The script expects `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE` and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).)\n+\n+Run the script:\n+\n+  ```\n+  $SAMPLEDIR/run_domain.sh\n+  ```\n+\n+At the end, you will see the message `Getting pod status - ctrl-c when all is running and ready to exit`. Then you should see a WebLogic Administration Server and two Managed Server pods start. After all the pods are up, you can use `ctrl-c` to exit the build script.\n+\n+\n+### Optionally test the sample application\n+\n+1. Ensure Traefik has been installed and is servicing external port 30305, as per [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).\n+\n+2. Create a Kubernetes Ingress for the domain's WebLogic cluster in the domain's namespace by using the sample Helm chart:\n+\n+   For Helm 2.x:", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5NjY4MjQ3Mg=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "3f46823be21e32c4b54a101d5590aeb40dbcdb15"}, "originalPosition": 352}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5NzUxODc3OA==", "bodyText": "Done.", "url": "https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/pull/1478#discussion_r397518778", "createdAt": "2020-03-24T23:17:30Z", "author": {"login": "tbarnes-us"}, "path": "docs-source/content/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,520 @@\n+---\n+title: \"Model in image\"\n+date: 2019-02-23T17:32:31-05:00\n+weight: 4\n+description: \"Sample for supplying a WebLogic Deploy Tool (WDT) model that the operator automatically expands into a full domain home during runtime.\"\n+---\n+\n+### Contents\n+\n+  - [Introduction](#introduction)\n+  - [References](#references)\n+  - [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types)\n+  - [Prerequisites for JRF domains](#prerequisites-for-jrf-domains)\n+    - [Set Up and Initialize an RCU Database](#set-up-and-initialize-an-rcu-database)\n+    - [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout)\n+    - [Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets](#set-up-rcu-model-attributes-domain-resource-attributes-and-secrets)\n+    - [Reusing or sharing RCU tables](#reusing-or-sharing-rcu-tables)\n+  - [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image)\n+  - [Create and deploy your Kubernetes resources](#create-and-deploy-your-kubernetes-resources)\n+  - [Optionally test the sample application](#optionally-test-the-sample-application)\n+  - [Optionally access the WebLogic console](#optionally-access-the-weblogic-console)\n+  - [Cleanup](#cleanup)\n+\n+### Introduction\n+\n+This sample demonstrates:\n+\n+  - Using the WebLogic Image Tool to create a Docker image that contains a WebLogic install, a WebLogic Deploy Tool (WDT) install, a Java EE servlet application contained within a WDT archive, and a WebLogic domain that's defined using a WDT model file.\n+  - Modifying the WDT model that's embedded within the Docker image using a WDT model file that's supplied using a Kubernetes config map.\n+  - Defining a `domainHomeSourceType: FromModel` domain resource that references the WDT model image and the WDT config map.\n+  - Deploying the model image, domain resource, model config map, and associated secrets that define user names, passwords, and URL values for the model and its domain resource.\n+  - Deploying and accessing a Traefik load balancer that redirects HTTP protocol calls to its Java EE servlet application.\n+\n+Supported domain types:\n+\n+There are three types of domains supported by Model in Image: a standard `WLS` domain, an Oracle Fusion Middleware Infrastructure Java Required Files (`JRF`) domain, or a `RestrictedJRF` domain.\n+\n+The `JRF` domain path through the sample includes additional steps for deploying an infrastructure database and initializing the database using the Repository Creation Utility (RCU) tool. `JRF` domains may be  used by Oracle products that layer on top of WebLogic Server such as SOA and OSB. Similarly, `RestrictedJRF` domains may be used by Oracle layered products such as Oracle Communications products.\n+\n+### References\n+\n+To reference the relevant user documentation, see:\n+ - [Model in Image User Guide]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) user documentation\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Server Deploy Tooling](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling)\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool)\n+\n+\n+\n+### Prerequisites for all domain types\n+\n+1. The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable must be set and must reference a valid JDK 8 installation. (`JAVA_HOME` is used by the WebLogic Image Tool.)\n+\n+2. Set a source directory environment variable `SRCDIR` that references the parent of the operator source tree. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   mkdir ~/wlopsrc\n+   cd ~/wlopsrc\n+   git clone https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator.git\n+   export SRCDIR=$(pwd)/weblogic-kubernetes-operator\n+   ```\n+\n+   For additional information about obtaining the operator source, see the [Developer Guide Requirements](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/developerguide/requirements/).\n+\n+3. Create a sample directory environment variable `SAMPLEDIR` that references this sample's directory:\n+\n+   ```\n+   export SAMPLEDIR=${SRCDIR}/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image/\n+   ```\n+\n+4. Create an empty, temporary working directory with 10g of space, and store its location in the `WORKDIR` environment variable. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd <location of empty temporary directory with 10g of space>\n+   export WORKDIR=$(pwd)\n+   ```\n+\n+5. Deploy the operator and set up the operator to manage the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`. Optionally, deploy a Traefik load balancer that manages the same namespace. For example, follow the same steps as the [Quick Start](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/quickstart/), up through the [Prepare for a domain]({{< relref \"/quickstart/prepare.md\" >}}) step.\n+\n+   Note that:\n+   - Deploying the Traefik load balancer is optional, but is a prerequisite for testing the web application that's deployed to WebLogic as part of this sample.\n+   - You can skip the Quick Start steps for obtaining a WebLogic image because you will be creating your own Docker image.\n+\n+\n+6. Choose the type of domain you're going to create: `WLS`, `JRF`, or `RestrictedJRF`, and set the environment variable, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, accordingly. The default is `WLS`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   export WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE=<one of WLS, JRF, or RestrictedJRF>\n+   ```\n+\n+7. Set up access to a base image for this sample that will be used as the base image for creating the final image. Do one of the following:\n+\n+   - __Option 1, download an existing WebLogic image.__\n+\n+     Set up access to this sample's base WebLogic image at the [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com):\n+\n+     a. Use a browser to access [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com).\n+\n+     b. Choose an image location:\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF` domains, select `Middleware`, then `fmw-infrastructure`.\n+       - For `WLS` domains, select `Middleware`, then `weblogic`.\n+\n+     c. Select Sign In and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+     d. Use your terminal to locally log in to Docker: `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+\n+     e. Later, when you run the sample, it will call `docker pull` for your base image based on the domain type.\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4`.\n+       - For `WLS`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4`.\n+\n+   - __Option 2, create your own WebLogic base image.__\n+\n+     Alternatively, you can create your own base image and override the sample's default base image name and tag by exporting the `BASE_IMAGE_NAME` and `BASE_IMAGE_TAG` environment variables prior to running the sample scripts. If you want to create your own base image, see [Preparing a Base Image]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-in-image/base-images/_index.md\" >}}).\n+\n+8. If you are using a `JRF` domain type, then it requires an RCU infrastructure database. See [Prerequisites for JRF Domains](#prerequisites-for-jrf-domains). You can do this step before or after you create your final image. If you're not using a `JRF` domain type, proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image).\n+\n+### Prerequisites for JRF domains\n+\n+> __NOTE__: This section is only required for demonstrating a `JRF` domain type. Skip this section and proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image) if your domain type is `WLS` or `RestrictedJRF`.\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database called an RCU database, requires initializing this database, and requires configuring your domain to access this database. All of these steps must occur before you first deploy your domain.\n+\n+Furthermore, if you want to have a restarted JRF domain access updates to the infrastructure database that the domain made at an earlier time, the restarted domain must be supplied a wallet file that was obtained from a previous run of the domain.\n+\n+The following steps demonstrate how to set up an infrastructure database that will work with this sample:\n+\n+  1. [Set up and initialize an RCU database](#set-up-and-initialize-an-rcu-database).\n+  2. [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout).\n+  3. [Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets](#set-up-rcu-model-attributes-domain-resource-attributes-and-secrets).\n+  4. [Reusing or sharing RCU tables](#reusing-or-sharing-rcu-tables).\n+\n+\n+\n+##### Set up and initialize an RCU database\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database and also requires initializing this database with a schema and a set of tables. The following example shows how to set up a sample RCU database and use the RCU tool to create the infrastructure schema for a JRF domain. The RCU database is set up with the following attributes:\n+\n+| Attribute | Value |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| database Kubernetes namespace | `default` |\n+| database Kubernetes pod | `oracle-db` |\n+| database image | `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` |\n+| database password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| infrastructure schema prefix | `FMW1` |\n+| infrastructure schema password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| database URL | `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s` |\n+\n+\n+1. Ensure you have access to the database image, and then deploy it:\n+\n+   - Use a browser to log in to `https://container-registry.oracle.com`, select `database->enterprise` and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+   - Get the database image:\n+     - In the local shell, `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+     - In the local shell, `docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim`.\n+\n+\n+       {{% notice note %}} If a local Docker login and manual pull of `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` is not sufficient (for example, if you are using a remote Kubernetes cluster), then uncomment the `imagePullSecrets` stanza in `$WORKDIR/k8s-db-slim.yaml` and create the image pull secret as follows:\n+\n+              ```\n+              kubectl create secret docker-registry regsecret \\\n+                --docker-server=container-registry.oracle.com \\\n+                --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+                --docker-password=your-password \\\n+                --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+              ```\n+       {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+\n+   - Use the sample script in `$SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service` to create an Oracle database running in the pod, `oracle-db`.\n+\n+      **NOTE**: If your database image access requires the `regsecret` image pull secret that you optionally created above, then pass `-s regsecret` to the `start-db-service.sh` command line.\n+\n+     ```\n+     cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service\n+     start-db-service.sh\n+     ```\n+\n+     This script will deploy a database with the URL, `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`, and administration password, `Oradoc_db1`.\n+\n+     {{% notice warning %}} The Oracle database Docker images are supported only for non-production use. For more details, see My Oracle Support note: Oracle Support for Database Running on Docker (Doc ID 2216342.1) : All the data is gone when the database is restarted.\n+     {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+     **NOTE**: This step is based on the steps documented in [Run a Database](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/userguide/overview/database/).\n+\n+2. Use the sample script in `SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema` to create the RCU schema with the schema prefix `FMW1`.\n+\n+   Note that this script assumes `Oradoc_db1` is the DBA password, `Oradoc_db1` is the schema password, and that the database URL is `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema\n+   ./create-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1 -i container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4\n+   ```\n+\n+   __NOTE__:  If you need to drop the repository, use this command:\n+\n+   ```\n+   drop-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1\n+   ```\n+\n+\n+##### Increase introspection job timeout\n+\n+Because JRF domain home creation takes a considerable amount of time the first time it is created, and because Model in Image creates your domain home for you using the introspection job, you should increase the timeout for the introspection job. Use the `configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds` in `k8s-domain.yaml.template` to override the default with a value of at least 300 seconds (the default is 120 seconds).  \n+\n+##### Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets\n+\n+To allow Model in Image to access the RCU database and OPSS wallet, it's necessary to set up an RCU access secret and an OPSS secret before deploying your domain. It's also necessary to define an `RCUDbInfo` stanza in your model. The sample already sets up all of these for you.  See:\n+\n+| Sample file | Description |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, with `password=welcome1`. |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, with appropriate values for attributes `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string`. |\n+| `model1.yaml.jrf` | Populates the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string` attributes by referencing their locations in the `sample-domain1-rcu-access` secret. The `build.sh` script uses this model instead of `model.yaml.wls` when the source domain type is `JRF`. |\n+| `k8s-domain.yaml.template` | Ensures that the domain mounts the OPSS key secret by setting the domain resource `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` attribute to `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, and ensures the domain mounts the RCU access secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, for reference by WDT model macros by setting the domain resource `configuration.secrets` attribute. Use configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds to increase the timeout value of the introspector job; see [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout). |\n+\n+ **NOTE**: This step is for information purposes only. Do not run the above sample files directly. The sample's main build and run scripts will run them for you.\n+\n+##### Reusing or sharing RCU tables\n+\n+Note that when you succesfully deploy your JRF domain resource for the first time, the introspector job will initialize the RCU tables for the domain using the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza in the WDT model plus the `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` specified in the domain resource. The job will also create a new domain home. Finally, the operator will also capture an OPSS wallet file from the new domain's local directory and place this file in a new Kubernetes config map.\n+\n+There are scenarios when the domain needs to be re-created between updates such as WebLogic credentials are changed, security roles defined in the WDT model have been changed or you want to share the same RCU tables with different domains.  Under these scenarios, the operator needs the `walletPasswordSecret` as well as the OPSS wallet file, together with the exact information in `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` so that the domain can be re-created and access the same set of RCU tables.  Without the wallet file and wallet password, you will not be able to re-create a domain accessing the same set of RCU tables, therefore it is highly recommended to backup the wallet file.\n+\n+To recover a domain's RCU tables between domain restarts or to share an RCU schema between different domains, it is necessary to extract this wallet file from the config map and save the OPSS wallet password secret that was used for the original domain. The wallet password and wallet file are needed again when you recreate the domain or share the database with other domains.\n+\n+To save the wallet file:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -s [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>]\n+```\n+\n+You should back up this file to a safe location that can be retrieved later.\n+\n+To reuse the wallet for subsequent redeployments or share the RCU tables between different domains:\n+\n+1. Store the wallet in a secret:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -r [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>] [-ws <name of the secret. Default DOMAIN_UID-opss-walletfile-secret> ]\n+\n+```\n+\n+2. Modify the domain resource YAML file to provide the secret names:\n+\n+```\n+  configuration:\n+    opss:\n+      # Name of secret with walletPassword for extracting the wallet\n+      walletPasswordSecret: sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret      \n+      # Name of secret with walletFile containing base64 encoded opss wallet\n+      walletFileSecret: sample-domain1-opss-walletfile-secret\n+\n+```\n+\n+See [Reusing an RCU database]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/reusing-rcu.md\" >}}) for instructions.\n+\n+### Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image\n+\n+Model in Image must contain a WebLogic install, a WebLogic Deploy Tool install, and your WDT model files. You can use the sample `./build.sh` script to build this image, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Uses `docker pull` to obtain a base image. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types) to set up access to the base image.)\n+  - Downloads the latest WebLogic Image Tool and WebLogic Deploy Tool to `WORKDIR`.\n+  - Creates and populates a staging directory `$WORKDIR/models` that contains your WDT model files and WDT application archive.\n+    - Builds  a simple servlet application in `$SAMPLEDIR/sample_app` into a WDT model application archive `$WORKDIR/models/archive1.zip`.\n+    - Copies sample model files from `$SAMPLEDIR/model-in-image` to `$WORKDIR/models`. This uses a model file that is appropriate to the domain type (for example, the `JRF` domain model includes database access configuration).\n+  - Uses the WebLogic Image Tool and the `$WORKDIR/models` staging directory to create a final image named `model-in-image:v1` that layers on the base image. Specifically, it runs the WebLogic Image Tool with its `update` option, which:\n+    - Builds the final image as a layer on the base image.\n+    - Puts a WDT install in image location, `/u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy`.\n+    - Copies the WDT model, properties, and application archive from `$WORDKIR/models` to image location, `/u01/wdt/models`.\n+\n+The script expects `JAVA_HOME`, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).)\n+\n+Run the script:\n+\n+  ```\n+  $SAMPLEDIR/build.sh\n+  ```\n+\n+If you intend to use a remote Docker registry, you need to tag and push the image to the remote Docker registry.\n+\n+1.  Tag the image for the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker tag <image-name>:<tag> <region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>:<tag>\n+```\n+\n+2.  Push the image to the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker push <region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>:<tag>\n+```\n+\n+3. Create the pull secret for the remote Docker registry:\n+\n+```\n+ kubectl -n <domain namespace> create secret docker-registry <secret name> \\\n+     --docker-server=<region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name> \\\n+     --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+     --docker-password=your-password \\\n+     --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+\n+```\n+\n+4. Update the domain template file `$SAMPLEDIR/k8s-domain.yaml.template` to provide the `imagePullSecrets`:\n+\n+```\n+  imagePullSecrets:\n+  - name: <secret name>\n+\n+```\n+\n+5. Export the environment variables for the image name and tag using the same values in step 1:\n+\n+```\n+export MODEL_IMAGE_NAME=\"<region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>\"\n+export MODEL_IMAGE_TAG=\"<tag>\"\n+```\n+\n+### Create and deploy your Kubernetes resources\n+\n+To deploy the sample operator domain and its required Kubernetes resources, use the sample script, `$SAMPLEDIR/run_domain.sh`, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Deletes the domain with a `DomainUID` of `domain1` in the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`, if it already exists.\n+  - Creates a secret containing your WebLogic administrator user name and password.\n+  - Creates a secret containing your Model in Image runtime encryption password:\n+    - All model-in-image domains must supply a runtime encryption secret with a `password` value.\n+    - It is used to encrypt configuration that is passed around internally by the Operator.\n+    - The value must be kept private but can be arbitrary: you can optionally supply a different secret value every time you restart the domain.\n+  - Creates secrets containing your RCU access URL, credentials, and prefix (these are unused unless the domain type is `JRF`).\n+  - Creates a config map containing an additional WDT model properties file, `$SAMPLEDIR/model1.20.properties`.\n+  - Generates a domain resource YAML file, `$WORKDIR/k8s-domain.yaml`, using `$SAMPLEDIR/k8s-domain.yaml.template`.\n+  - Deploys `k8s-domain.yaml`.\n+  - Displays the status of the domain pods.\n+\n+The script expects `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE` and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).)\n+\n+Run the script:\n+\n+  ```\n+  $SAMPLEDIR/run_domain.sh\n+  ```\n+\n+At the end, you will see the message `Getting pod status - ctrl-c when all is running and ready to exit`. Then you should see a WebLogic Administration Server and two Managed Server pods start. After all the pods are up, you can use `ctrl-c` to exit the build script.\n+\n+\n+### Optionally test the sample application\n+\n+1. Ensure Traefik has been installed and is servicing external port 30305, as per [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).\n+\n+2. Create a Kubernetes Ingress for the domain's WebLogic cluster in the domain's namespace by using the sample Helm chart:\n+\n+   For Helm 2.x:", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5NjY4MjQ3Mg=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "3f46823be21e32c4b54a101d5590aeb40dbcdb15"}, "originalPosition": 352}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMjQ1OTA1MDA4OnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "docs-source/content/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md", "isResolved": true, "comments": {"totalCount": 3, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMy0yM1QxODo1NTozNFrOF6Tr2w==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMy0yM1QyMjoxMjo1NVrOF6aBVg==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5NjY4NDI1MQ==", "bodyText": "browser", "url": "https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/pull/1478#discussion_r396684251", "createdAt": "2020-03-23T18:55:34Z", "author": {"login": "rjeberhard"}, "path": "docs-source/content/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,520 @@\n+---\n+title: \"Model in image\"\n+date: 2019-02-23T17:32:31-05:00\n+weight: 4\n+description: \"Sample for supplying a WebLogic Deploy Tool (WDT) model that the operator automatically expands into a full domain home during runtime.\"\n+---\n+\n+### Contents\n+\n+  - [Introduction](#introduction)\n+  - [References](#references)\n+  - [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types)\n+  - [Prerequisites for JRF domains](#prerequisites-for-jrf-domains)\n+    - [Set Up and Initialize an RCU Database](#set-up-and-initialize-an-rcu-database)\n+    - [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout)\n+    - [Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets](#set-up-rcu-model-attributes-domain-resource-attributes-and-secrets)\n+    - [Reusing or sharing RCU tables](#reusing-or-sharing-rcu-tables)\n+  - [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image)\n+  - [Create and deploy your Kubernetes resources](#create-and-deploy-your-kubernetes-resources)\n+  - [Optionally test the sample application](#optionally-test-the-sample-application)\n+  - [Optionally access the WebLogic console](#optionally-access-the-weblogic-console)\n+  - [Cleanup](#cleanup)\n+\n+### Introduction\n+\n+This sample demonstrates:\n+\n+  - Using the WebLogic Image Tool to create a Docker image that contains a WebLogic install, a WebLogic Deploy Tool (WDT) install, a Java EE servlet application contained within a WDT archive, and a WebLogic domain that's defined using a WDT model file.\n+  - Modifying the WDT model that's embedded within the Docker image using a WDT model file that's supplied using a Kubernetes config map.\n+  - Defining a `domainHomeSourceType: FromModel` domain resource that references the WDT model image and the WDT config map.\n+  - Deploying the model image, domain resource, model config map, and associated secrets that define user names, passwords, and URL values for the model and its domain resource.\n+  - Deploying and accessing a Traefik load balancer that redirects HTTP protocol calls to its Java EE servlet application.\n+\n+Supported domain types:\n+\n+There are three types of domains supported by Model in Image: a standard `WLS` domain, an Oracle Fusion Middleware Infrastructure Java Required Files (`JRF`) domain, or a `RestrictedJRF` domain.\n+\n+The `JRF` domain path through the sample includes additional steps for deploying an infrastructure database and initializing the database using the Repository Creation Utility (RCU) tool. `JRF` domains may be  used by Oracle products that layer on top of WebLogic Server such as SOA and OSB. Similarly, `RestrictedJRF` domains may be used by Oracle layered products such as Oracle Communications products.\n+\n+### References\n+\n+To reference the relevant user documentation, see:\n+ - [Model in Image User Guide]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) user documentation\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Server Deploy Tooling](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling)\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool)\n+\n+\n+\n+### Prerequisites for all domain types\n+\n+1. The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable must be set and must reference a valid JDK 8 installation. (`JAVA_HOME` is used by the WebLogic Image Tool.)\n+\n+2. Set a source directory environment variable `SRCDIR` that references the parent of the operator source tree. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   mkdir ~/wlopsrc\n+   cd ~/wlopsrc\n+   git clone https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator.git\n+   export SRCDIR=$(pwd)/weblogic-kubernetes-operator\n+   ```\n+\n+   For additional information about obtaining the operator source, see the [Developer Guide Requirements](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/developerguide/requirements/).\n+\n+3. Create a sample directory environment variable `SAMPLEDIR` that references this sample's directory:\n+\n+   ```\n+   export SAMPLEDIR=${SRCDIR}/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image/\n+   ```\n+\n+4. Create an empty, temporary working directory with 10g of space, and store its location in the `WORKDIR` environment variable. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd <location of empty temporary directory with 10g of space>\n+   export WORKDIR=$(pwd)\n+   ```\n+\n+5. Deploy the operator and set up the operator to manage the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`. Optionally, deploy a Traefik load balancer that manages the same namespace. For example, follow the same steps as the [Quick Start](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/quickstart/), up through the [Prepare for a domain]({{< relref \"/quickstart/prepare.md\" >}}) step.\n+\n+   Note that:\n+   - Deploying the Traefik load balancer is optional, but is a prerequisite for testing the web application that's deployed to WebLogic as part of this sample.\n+   - You can skip the Quick Start steps for obtaining a WebLogic image because you will be creating your own Docker image.\n+\n+\n+6. Choose the type of domain you're going to create: `WLS`, `JRF`, or `RestrictedJRF`, and set the environment variable, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, accordingly. The default is `WLS`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   export WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE=<one of WLS, JRF, or RestrictedJRF>\n+   ```\n+\n+7. Set up access to a base image for this sample that will be used as the base image for creating the final image. Do one of the following:\n+\n+   - __Option 1, download an existing WebLogic image.__\n+\n+     Set up access to this sample's base WebLogic image at the [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com):\n+\n+     a. Use a browser to access [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com).\n+\n+     b. Choose an image location:\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF` domains, select `Middleware`, then `fmw-infrastructure`.\n+       - For `WLS` domains, select `Middleware`, then `weblogic`.\n+\n+     c. Select Sign In and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+     d. Use your terminal to locally log in to Docker: `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+\n+     e. Later, when you run the sample, it will call `docker pull` for your base image based on the domain type.\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4`.\n+       - For `WLS`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4`.\n+\n+   - __Option 2, create your own WebLogic base image.__\n+\n+     Alternatively, you can create your own base image and override the sample's default base image name and tag by exporting the `BASE_IMAGE_NAME` and `BASE_IMAGE_TAG` environment variables prior to running the sample scripts. If you want to create your own base image, see [Preparing a Base Image]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-in-image/base-images/_index.md\" >}}).\n+\n+8. If you are using a `JRF` domain type, then it requires an RCU infrastructure database. See [Prerequisites for JRF Domains](#prerequisites-for-jrf-domains). You can do this step before or after you create your final image. If you're not using a `JRF` domain type, proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image).\n+\n+### Prerequisites for JRF domains\n+\n+> __NOTE__: This section is only required for demonstrating a `JRF` domain type. Skip this section and proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image) if your domain type is `WLS` or `RestrictedJRF`.\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database called an RCU database, requires initializing this database, and requires configuring your domain to access this database. All of these steps must occur before you first deploy your domain.\n+\n+Furthermore, if you want to have a restarted JRF domain access updates to the infrastructure database that the domain made at an earlier time, the restarted domain must be supplied a wallet file that was obtained from a previous run of the domain.\n+\n+The following steps demonstrate how to set up an infrastructure database that will work with this sample:\n+\n+  1. [Set up and initialize an RCU database](#set-up-and-initialize-an-rcu-database).\n+  2. [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout).\n+  3. [Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets](#set-up-rcu-model-attributes-domain-resource-attributes-and-secrets).\n+  4. [Reusing or sharing RCU tables](#reusing-or-sharing-rcu-tables).\n+\n+\n+\n+##### Set up and initialize an RCU database\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database and also requires initializing this database with a schema and a set of tables. The following example shows how to set up a sample RCU database and use the RCU tool to create the infrastructure schema for a JRF domain. The RCU database is set up with the following attributes:\n+\n+| Attribute | Value |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| database Kubernetes namespace | `default` |\n+| database Kubernetes pod | `oracle-db` |\n+| database image | `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` |\n+| database password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| infrastructure schema prefix | `FMW1` |\n+| infrastructure schema password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| database URL | `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s` |\n+\n+\n+1. Ensure you have access to the database image, and then deploy it:\n+\n+   - Use a browser to log in to `https://container-registry.oracle.com`, select `database->enterprise` and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+   - Get the database image:\n+     - In the local shell, `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+     - In the local shell, `docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim`.\n+\n+\n+       {{% notice note %}} If a local Docker login and manual pull of `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` is not sufficient (for example, if you are using a remote Kubernetes cluster), then uncomment the `imagePullSecrets` stanza in `$WORKDIR/k8s-db-slim.yaml` and create the image pull secret as follows:\n+\n+              ```\n+              kubectl create secret docker-registry regsecret \\\n+                --docker-server=container-registry.oracle.com \\\n+                --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+                --docker-password=your-password \\\n+                --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+              ```\n+       {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+\n+   - Use the sample script in `$SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service` to create an Oracle database running in the pod, `oracle-db`.\n+\n+      **NOTE**: If your database image access requires the `regsecret` image pull secret that you optionally created above, then pass `-s regsecret` to the `start-db-service.sh` command line.\n+\n+     ```\n+     cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service\n+     start-db-service.sh\n+     ```\n+\n+     This script will deploy a database with the URL, `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`, and administration password, `Oradoc_db1`.\n+\n+     {{% notice warning %}} The Oracle database Docker images are supported only for non-production use. For more details, see My Oracle Support note: Oracle Support for Database Running on Docker (Doc ID 2216342.1) : All the data is gone when the database is restarted.\n+     {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+     **NOTE**: This step is based on the steps documented in [Run a Database](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/userguide/overview/database/).\n+\n+2. Use the sample script in `SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema` to create the RCU schema with the schema prefix `FMW1`.\n+\n+   Note that this script assumes `Oradoc_db1` is the DBA password, `Oradoc_db1` is the schema password, and that the database URL is `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema\n+   ./create-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1 -i container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4\n+   ```\n+\n+   __NOTE__:  If you need to drop the repository, use this command:\n+\n+   ```\n+   drop-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1\n+   ```\n+\n+\n+##### Increase introspection job timeout\n+\n+Because JRF domain home creation takes a considerable amount of time the first time it is created, and because Model in Image creates your domain home for you using the introspection job, you should increase the timeout for the introspection job. Use the `configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds` in `k8s-domain.yaml.template` to override the default with a value of at least 300 seconds (the default is 120 seconds).  \n+\n+##### Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets\n+\n+To allow Model in Image to access the RCU database and OPSS wallet, it's necessary to set up an RCU access secret and an OPSS secret before deploying your domain. It's also necessary to define an `RCUDbInfo` stanza in your model. The sample already sets up all of these for you.  See:\n+\n+| Sample file | Description |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, with `password=welcome1`. |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, with appropriate values for attributes `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string`. |\n+| `model1.yaml.jrf` | Populates the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string` attributes by referencing their locations in the `sample-domain1-rcu-access` secret. The `build.sh` script uses this model instead of `model.yaml.wls` when the source domain type is `JRF`. |\n+| `k8s-domain.yaml.template` | Ensures that the domain mounts the OPSS key secret by setting the domain resource `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` attribute to `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, and ensures the domain mounts the RCU access secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, for reference by WDT model macros by setting the domain resource `configuration.secrets` attribute. Use configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds to increase the timeout value of the introspector job; see [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout). |\n+\n+ **NOTE**: This step is for information purposes only. Do not run the above sample files directly. The sample's main build and run scripts will run them for you.\n+\n+##### Reusing or sharing RCU tables\n+\n+Note that when you succesfully deploy your JRF domain resource for the first time, the introspector job will initialize the RCU tables for the domain using the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza in the WDT model plus the `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` specified in the domain resource. The job will also create a new domain home. Finally, the operator will also capture an OPSS wallet file from the new domain's local directory and place this file in a new Kubernetes config map.\n+\n+There are scenarios when the domain needs to be re-created between updates such as WebLogic credentials are changed, security roles defined in the WDT model have been changed or you want to share the same RCU tables with different domains.  Under these scenarios, the operator needs the `walletPasswordSecret` as well as the OPSS wallet file, together with the exact information in `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` so that the domain can be re-created and access the same set of RCU tables.  Without the wallet file and wallet password, you will not be able to re-create a domain accessing the same set of RCU tables, therefore it is highly recommended to backup the wallet file.\n+\n+To recover a domain's RCU tables between domain restarts or to share an RCU schema between different domains, it is necessary to extract this wallet file from the config map and save the OPSS wallet password secret that was used for the original domain. The wallet password and wallet file are needed again when you recreate the domain or share the database with other domains.\n+\n+To save the wallet file:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -s [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>]\n+```\n+\n+You should back up this file to a safe location that can be retrieved later.\n+\n+To reuse the wallet for subsequent redeployments or share the RCU tables between different domains:\n+\n+1. Store the wallet in a secret:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -r [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>] [-ws <name of the secret. Default DOMAIN_UID-opss-walletfile-secret> ]\n+\n+```\n+\n+2. Modify the domain resource YAML file to provide the secret names:\n+\n+```\n+  configuration:\n+    opss:\n+      # Name of secret with walletPassword for extracting the wallet\n+      walletPasswordSecret: sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret      \n+      # Name of secret with walletFile containing base64 encoded opss wallet\n+      walletFileSecret: sample-domain1-opss-walletfile-secret\n+\n+```\n+\n+See [Reusing an RCU database]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/reusing-rcu.md\" >}}) for instructions.\n+\n+### Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image\n+\n+Model in Image must contain a WebLogic install, a WebLogic Deploy Tool install, and your WDT model files. You can use the sample `./build.sh` script to build this image, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Uses `docker pull` to obtain a base image. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types) to set up access to the base image.)\n+  - Downloads the latest WebLogic Image Tool and WebLogic Deploy Tool to `WORKDIR`.\n+  - Creates and populates a staging directory `$WORKDIR/models` that contains your WDT model files and WDT application archive.\n+    - Builds  a simple servlet application in `$SAMPLEDIR/sample_app` into a WDT model application archive `$WORKDIR/models/archive1.zip`.\n+    - Copies sample model files from `$SAMPLEDIR/model-in-image` to `$WORKDIR/models`. This uses a model file that is appropriate to the domain type (for example, the `JRF` domain model includes database access configuration).\n+  - Uses the WebLogic Image Tool and the `$WORKDIR/models` staging directory to create a final image named `model-in-image:v1` that layers on the base image. Specifically, it runs the WebLogic Image Tool with its `update` option, which:\n+    - Builds the final image as a layer on the base image.\n+    - Puts a WDT install in image location, `/u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy`.\n+    - Copies the WDT model, properties, and application archive from `$WORDKIR/models` to image location, `/u01/wdt/models`.\n+\n+The script expects `JAVA_HOME`, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).)\n+\n+Run the script:\n+\n+  ```\n+  $SAMPLEDIR/build.sh\n+  ```\n+\n+If you intend to use a remote Docker registry, you need to tag and push the image to the remote Docker registry.\n+\n+1.  Tag the image for the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker tag <image-name>:<tag> <region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>:<tag>\n+```\n+\n+2.  Push the image to the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker push <region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>:<tag>\n+```\n+\n+3. Create the pull secret for the remote Docker registry:\n+\n+```\n+ kubectl -n <domain namespace> create secret docker-registry <secret name> \\\n+     --docker-server=<region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name> \\\n+     --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+     --docker-password=your-password \\\n+     --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+\n+```\n+\n+4. Update the domain template file `$SAMPLEDIR/k8s-domain.yaml.template` to provide the `imagePullSecrets`:\n+\n+```\n+  imagePullSecrets:\n+  - name: <secret name>\n+\n+```\n+\n+5. Export the environment variables for the image name and tag using the same values in step 1:\n+\n+```\n+export MODEL_IMAGE_NAME=\"<region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>\"\n+export MODEL_IMAGE_TAG=\"<tag>\"\n+```\n+\n+### Create and deploy your Kubernetes resources\n+\n+To deploy the sample operator domain and its required Kubernetes resources, use the sample script, `$SAMPLEDIR/run_domain.sh`, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Deletes the domain with a `DomainUID` of `domain1` in the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`, if it already exists.\n+  - Creates a secret containing your WebLogic administrator user name and password.\n+  - Creates a secret containing your Model in Image runtime encryption password:\n+    - All model-in-image domains must supply a runtime encryption secret with a `password` value.\n+    - It is used to encrypt configuration that is passed around internally by the Operator.\n+    - The value must be kept private but can be arbitrary: you can optionally supply a different secret value every time you restart the domain.\n+  - Creates secrets containing your RCU access URL, credentials, and prefix (these are unused unless the domain type is `JRF`).\n+  - Creates a config map containing an additional WDT model properties file, `$SAMPLEDIR/model1.20.properties`.\n+  - Generates a domain resource YAML file, `$WORKDIR/k8s-domain.yaml`, using `$SAMPLEDIR/k8s-domain.yaml.template`.\n+  - Deploys `k8s-domain.yaml`.\n+  - Displays the status of the domain pods.\n+\n+The script expects `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE` and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).)\n+\n+Run the script:\n+\n+  ```\n+  $SAMPLEDIR/run_domain.sh\n+  ```\n+\n+At the end, you will see the message `Getting pod status - ctrl-c when all is running and ready to exit`. Then you should see a WebLogic Administration Server and two Managed Server pods start. After all the pods are up, you can use `ctrl-c` to exit the build script.\n+\n+\n+### Optionally test the sample application\n+\n+1. Ensure Traefik has been installed and is servicing external port 30305, as per [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).\n+\n+2. Create a Kubernetes Ingress for the domain's WebLogic cluster in the domain's namespace by using the sample Helm chart:\n+\n+   For Helm 2.x:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd $SRCDIR\n+   $ helm install kubernetes/samples/charts/ingress-per-domain \\\n+     --name sample-domain1-ingress \\\n+     --namespace sample-domain1-ns \\\n+     --set wlsDomain.domainUID=sample-domain1 \\\n+     --set traefik.hostname=sample-domain1.org\n+   ```\n+\n+   For Helm 3.x:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd $SRCDIR\n+   helm install sample-domain1-ingress kubernetes/samples/charts/ingress-per-domain \\\n+    --namespace sample-domain1-ns \\\n+    --set wlsDomain.domainUID=sample-domain1 \\\n+    --set traefik.hostname=sample-domain1.org\n+   ```\n+\n+   This creates an Kubernetes Ingress that helps route HTTP traffic from the Traefik load balancer's external port 30305 to the WebLogic domain's `cluster-1` 8001 port. Note that the WDT config map in this sample changes the cluster's port from 9001 to 8001 (9001 is the original port configured using the WDT model defined within in the image).\n+\n+3. Send a web application request to the load balancer:\n+\n+   ```\n+   curl -H 'host: sample-domain1.org' http://$(hostname).$(dnsdomainname):30305/sample_war/index.jsp\n+   ```\n+\n+   You should see something like the following:\n+\n+   ```\n+   Hello World, you have reached server managed-server1\n+   ```\n+\n+   **Note**: If you're running on a remote Kubernetes cluster, then substitute `$(hostname).$(dnsdomainname)` with an external address suitable for contacting the cluster.\n+\n+4. Send a ReadyApp request to the load balancer (ReadyApp is a built-in WebLogic Server application):\n+\n+   ```\n+   curl -v -H 'host: sample-domain1.org' http://$(hostname).$(dnsdomainname):30305/weblogic/ready\n+   ```\n+\n+   You should see something like the following:\n+\n+\n+   ```\n+   * About to connect() to myhost.my.dns.domain.name port 30305 (#0)\n+   *   Trying 100.111.142.32...\n+   * Connected to myhost.my.dns.domain.name (100.111.142.32) port 30305 (#0)\n+   > GET /weblogic/ready HTTP/1.1\n+   > User-Agent: curl/7.29.0\n+   > Accept: */*\n+   > host: sample-domain1.org\n+   >\n+   < HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n+   < Content-Length: 0\n+   < Date: Mon, 09 Mar 2020 20:40:37 GMT\n+   < Vary: Accept-Encoding\n+   <\n+   * Connection #0 to host myhost.my.dns.domain.name left intact\n+   ```\n+\n+   **Note**: If you're running on a remote Kubernetes cluster, then substitute `$(hostname).$(dnsdomainname)` with an external address suitable for contacting the cluster.\n+\n+### Optionally access the WebLogic console\n+\n+You can add an ingress rule to access the WebLogic Console from your local browser\n+\n+1. Find out the service name of the admin server and service port number.\n+\n+The name follows the pattern <Domain UID>-<admin server name> all lower case and the port number will be described in your \n+WDT model's admin server `listenPort`.\n+\n+You can also find the information by:\n+\n+```\n+kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns get services\n+```\n+\n+```\n+NAME                               TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE\n+sample-domain1-admin-server        ClusterIP   None           <none>        7001/TCP   48m\n+```\n+\n+This shows the admin service name is `sample-domain1-admin-server` and the port for the console is `7001`\n+\n+2. Create an ingress rule for the WebLogic console\n+\n+Create the following file and call it `console-ingress.yaml` in your `$WORKDIR`.\n+\n+```\n+apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\n+kind: Ingress\n+metadata:\n+  name: sample-domain1-console-ingress\n+  namespace: sample-domain1-ns\n+  annotations:\n+    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: traefik\n+spec:\n+  rules:\n+  - host:\n+    http:\n+      paths:\n+      - path: /console\n+        backend:\n+          serviceName: sample-domain1-admin-server\n+          servicePort: 7001\n+\n+```\n+\n+This will route the request path `/console` to the admin service port `7001` at pod `sample-domain1-admin-server` in the `sample-domain1-ns` namespace.\n+\n+3.

Similarly, `RestrictedJRF` domains may be used by Oracle layered products such as Oracle Communications products.\n+\n+### References\n+\n+To reference the relevant user documentation, see:\n+ - [Model in Image User Guide]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) user documentation\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Server Deploy Tooling](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling)\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool)\n+\n+\n+\n+### Prerequisites for all domain types\n+\n+1. The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable must be set and must reference a valid JDK 8 installation. (`JAVA_HOME` is used by the WebLogic Image Tool.)\n+\n+2. Set a source directory environment variable `SRCDIR` that references the parent of the operator source tree. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   mkdir ~/wlopsrc\n+   cd ~/wlopsrc\n+   git clone https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator.git\n+   export SRCDIR=$(pwd)/weblogic-kubernetes-operator\n+   ```\n+\n+   For additional information about obtaining the operator source, see the [Developer Guide Requirements](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/developerguide/requirements/).\n+\n+3. Create a sample directory environment variable `SAMPLEDIR` that references this sample's directory:\n+\n+   ```\n+   export SAMPLEDIR=${SRCDIR}/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image/\n+   ```\n+\n+4. Create an empty, temporary working directory with 10g of space, and store its location in the `WORKDIR` environment variable. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd <location of empty temporary directory with 10g of space>\n+   export WORKDIR=$(pwd)\n+   ```\n+\n+5. Deploy the operator and set up the operator to manage the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`. Optionally, deploy a Traefik load balancer that manages the same namespace. For example, follow the same steps as the [Quick Start](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/quickstart/), up through the [Prepare for a domain]({{< relref \"/quickstart/prepare.md\" >}}) step.\n+\n+   Note that:\n+   - Deploying the Traefik load balancer is optional, but is a prerequisite for testing the web application that's deployed to WebLogic as part of this sample.\n+   - You can skip the Quick Start steps for obtaining a WebLogic image because you will be creating your own Docker image.\n+\n+\n+6. Choose the type of domain you're going to create: `WLS`, `JRF`, or `RestrictedJRF`, and set the environment variable, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, accordingly. The default is `WLS`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   export WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE=<one of WLS, JRF, or RestrictedJRF>\n+   ```\n+\n+7. Set up access to a base image for this sample that will be used as the base image for creating the final image. Do one of the following:\n+\n+   - __Option 1, download an existing WebLogic image.__\n+\n+     Set up access to this sample's base WebLogic image at the [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com):\n+\n+     a. Use a browser to access [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com).\n+\n+     b. Choose an image location:\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF` domains, select `Middleware`, then `fmw-infrastructure`.\n+       - For `WLS` domains, select `Middleware`, then `weblogic`.\n+\n+     c. Select Sign In and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+     d. Use your terminal to locally log in to Docker: `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+\n+     e. Later, when you run the sample, it will call `docker pull` for your base image based on the domain type.\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4`.\n+       - For `WLS`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4`.\n+\n+   - __Option 2, create your own WebLogic base image.__\n+\n+     Alternatively, you can create your own base image and override the sample's default base image name and tag by exporting the `BASE_IMAGE_NAME` and `BASE_IMAGE_TAG` environment variables prior to running the sample scripts. If you want to create your own base image, see [Preparing a Base Image]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-in-image/base-images/_index.md\" >}}).\n+\n+8. If you are using a `JRF` domain type, then it requires an RCU infrastructure database. See [Prerequisites for JRF Domains](#prerequisites-for-jrf-domains). You can do this step before or after you create your final image. If you're not using a `JRF` domain type, proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image).\n+\n+### Prerequisites for JRF domains\n+\n+> __NOTE__: This section is only required for demonstrating a `JRF` domain type. Skip this section and proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image) if your domain type is `WLS` or `RestrictedJRF`.\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database called an RCU database, requires initializing this database, and requires configuring your domain to access this database. All of these steps must occur before you first deploy your domain.\n+\n+Furthermore, if you want to have a restarted JRF domain access updates to the infrastructure database that the domain made at an earlier time, the restarted domain must be supplied a wallet file that was obtained from a previous run of the domain.\n+\n+The following steps demonstrate how to set up an infrastructure database that will work with this sample:\n+\n+  1. [Set up and initialize an RCU database](#set-up-and-initialize-an-rcu-database).\n+  2. [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout).\n+  3. [Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets](#set-up-rcu-model-attributes-domain-resource-attributes-and-secrets).\n+  4. [Reusing or sharing RCU tables](#reusing-or-sharing-rcu-tables).\n+\n+\n+\n+##### Set up and initialize an RCU database\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database and also requires initializing this database with a schema and a set of tables. The following example shows how to set up a sample RCU database and use the RCU tool to create the infrastructure schema for a JRF domain. The RCU database is set up with the following attributes:\n+\n+| Attribute | Value |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| database Kubernetes namespace | `default` |\n+| database Kubernetes pod | `oracle-db` |\n+| database image | `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` |\n+| database password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| infrastructure schema prefix | `FMW1` |\n+| infrastructure schema password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| database URL | `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s` |\n+\n+\n+1. Ensure you have access to the database image, and then deploy it:\n+\n+   - Use a browser to log in to `https://container-registry.oracle.com`, select `database->enterprise` and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+   - Get the database image:\n+     - In the local shell, `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+     - In the local shell, `docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim`.\n+\n+\n+       {{% notice note %}} If a local Docker login and manual pull of `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` is not sufficient (for example, if you are using a remote Kubernetes cluster), then uncomment the `imagePullSecrets` stanza in `$WORKDIR/k8s-db-slim.yaml` and create the image pull secret as follows:\n+\n+              ```\n+              kubectl create secret docker-registry regsecret \\\n+                --docker-server=container-registry.oracle.com \\\n+                --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+                --docker-password=your-password \\\n+                --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+              ```\n+       {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+\n+   - Use the sample script in `$SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service` to create an Oracle database running in the pod, `oracle-db`.\n+\n+      **NOTE**: If your database image access requires the `regsecret` image pull secret that you optionally created above, then pass `-s regsecret` to the `start-db-service.sh` command line.\n+\n+     ```\n+     cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service\n+     start-db-service.sh\n+     ```\n+\n+     This script will deploy a database with the URL, `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`, and administration password, `Oradoc_db1`.\n+\n+     {{% notice warning %}} The Oracle database Docker images are supported only for non-production use. For more details, see My Oracle Support note: Oracle Support for Database Running on Docker (Doc ID 2216342.1) : All the data is gone when the database is restarted.\n+     {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+     **NOTE**: This step is based on the steps documented in [Run a Database](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/userguide/overview/database/).\n+\n+2. Use the sample script in `SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema` to create the RCU schema with the schema prefix `FMW1`.\n+\n+   Note that this script assumes `Oradoc_db1` is the DBA password, `Oradoc_db1` is the schema password, and that the database URL is `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema\n+   ./create-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1 -i container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4\n+   ```\n+\n+   __NOTE__:  If you need to drop the repository, use this command:\n+\n+   ```\n+   drop-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1\n+   ```\n+\n+\n+##### Increase introspection job timeout\n+\n+Because JRF domain home creation takes a considerable amount of time the first time it is created, and because Model in Image creates your domain home for you using the introspection job, you should increase the timeout for the introspection job. Use the `configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds` in `k8s-domain.yaml.template` to override the default with a value of at least 300 seconds (the default is 120 seconds).  \n+\n+##### Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets\n+\n+To allow Model in Image to access the RCU database and OPSS wallet, it's necessary to set up an RCU access secret and an OPSS secret before deploying your domain. It's also necessary to define an `RCUDbInfo` stanza in your model. The sample already sets up all of these for you.  See:\n+\n+| Sample file | Description |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, with `password=welcome1`. |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, with appropriate values for attributes `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string`. |\n+| `model1.yaml.jrf` | Populates the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string` attributes by referencing their locations in the `sample-domain1-rcu-access` secret. The `build.sh` script uses this model instead of `model.yaml.wls` when the source domain type is `JRF`. |\n+| `k8s-domain.yaml.template` | Ensures that the domain mounts the OPSS key secret by setting the domain resource `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` attribute to `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, and ensures the domain mounts the RCU access secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, for reference by WDT model macros by setting the domain resource `configuration.secrets` attribute. Use configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds to increase the timeout value of the introspector job; see [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout). |\n+\n+ **NOTE**: This step is for information purposes only. Do not run the above sample files directly. The sample's main build and run scripts will run them for you.\n+\n+##### Reusing or sharing RCU tables\n+\n+Note that when you succesfully deploy your JRF domain resource for the first time, the introspector job will initialize the RCU tables for the domain using the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza in the WDT model plus the `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` specified in the domain resource. The job will also create a new domain home. Finally, the operator will also capture an OPSS wallet file from the new domain's local directory and place this file in a new Kubernetes config map.\n+\n+There are scenarios when the domain needs to be re-created between updates such as WebLogic credentials are changed, security roles defined in the WDT model have been changed or you want to share the same RCU tables with different domains.  Under these scenarios, the operator needs the `walletPasswordSecret` as well as the OPSS wallet file, together with the exact information in `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` so that the domain can be re-created and access the same set of RCU tables.  Without the wallet file and wallet password, you will not be able to re-create a domain accessing the same set of RCU tables, therefore it is highly recommended to backup the wallet file.\n+\n+To recover a domain's RCU tables between domain restarts or to share an RCU schema between different domains, it is necessary to extract this wallet file from the config map and save the OPSS wallet password secret that was used for the original domain. The wallet password and wallet file are needed again when you recreate the domain or share the database with other domains.\n+\n+To save the wallet file:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -s [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>]\n+```\n+\n+You should back up this file to a safe location that can be retrieved later.\n+\n+To reuse the wallet for subsequent redeployments or share the RCU tables between different domains:\n+\n+1. Store the wallet in a secret:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -r [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>] [-ws <name of the secret. Default DOMAIN_UID-opss-walletfile-secret> ]\n+\n+```\n+\n+2.

You can use the sample `./build.sh` script to build this image, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Uses `docker pull` to obtain a base image. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types) to set up access to the base image.)\n+  - Downloads the latest WebLogic Image Tool and WebLogic Deploy Tool to `WORKDIR`.\n+  - Creates and populates a staging directory `$WORKDIR/models` that contains your WDT model files and WDT application archive.\n+    - Builds  a simple servlet application in `$SAMPLEDIR/sample_app` into a WDT model application archive `$WORKDIR/models/archive1.zip`.\n+    - Copies sample model files from `$SAMPLEDIR/model-in-image` to `$WORKDIR/models`. This uses a model file that is appropriate to the domain type (for example, the `JRF` domain model includes database access configuration).\n+  - Uses the WebLogic Image Tool and the `$WORKDIR/models` staging directory to create a final image named `model-in-image:v1` that layers on the base image. Specifically, it runs the WebLogic Image Tool with its `update` option, which:\n+    - Builds the final image as a layer on the base image.\n+    - Puts a WDT install in image location, `/u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy`.\n+    - Copies the WDT model, properties, and application archive from `$WORDKIR/models` to image location, `/u01/wdt/models`.\n+\n+The script expects `JAVA_HOME`, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).)\n+\n+Run the script:\n+\n+  ```\n+  $SAMPLEDIR/build.sh\n+  ```\n+\n+If you intend to use a remote Docker registry, you need to tag and push the image to the remote Docker registry.\n+\n+1.  Tag the image for the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker tag <image-name>:<tag> <region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>:<tag>\n+```\n+\n+2.  Push the image to the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker push <region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>:<tag>\n+```\n+\n+3. Create the pull secret for the remote Docker registry:\n+\n+```\n+ kubectl -n <domain namespace> create secret docker-registry <secret name> \\\n+     --docker-server=<region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name> \\\n+     --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+     --docker-password=your-password \\\n+     --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+\n+```\n+\n+4. Update the domain template file `$SAMPLEDIR/k8s-domain.yaml.template` to provide the `imagePullSecrets`:\n+\n+```\n+  imagePullSecrets:\n+  - name: <secret name>\n+\n+```\n+\n+5. Export the environment variables for the image name and tag using the same values in step 1:\n+\n+```\n+export MODEL_IMAGE_NAME=\"<region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>\"\n+export MODEL_IMAGE_TAG=\"<tag>\"\n+```\n+\n+### Create and deploy your Kubernetes resources\n+\n+To deploy the sample operator domain and its required Kubernetes resources, use the sample script, `$SAMPLEDIR/run_domain.sh`, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Deletes the domain with a `DomainUID` of `domain1` in the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`, if it already exists.\n+  - Creates a secret containing your WebLogic administrator user name and password.\n+  - Creates a secret containing your Model in Image runtime encryption password:\n+    - All model-in-image domains must supply a runtime encryption secret with a `password` value.\n+    - It is used to encrypt configuration that is passed around internally by the Operator.\n+    - The value must be kept private but can be arbitrary: you can optionally supply a different secret value every time you restart the domain.\n+  - Creates secrets containing your RCU access URL, credentials, and prefix (these are unused unless the domain type is `JRF`).\n+  - Creates a config map containing an additional WDT model properties file, `$SAMPLEDIR/model1.20.properties`.\n+  - Generates a domain resource YAML file, `$WORKDIR/k8s-domain.yaml`, using `$SAMPLEDIR/k8s-domain.yaml.template`.\n+  - Deploys `k8s-domain.yaml`.\n+  - Displays the status of the domain pods.\n+\n+The script expects `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE` and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).)\n+\n+Run the script:\n+\n+  ```\n+  $SAMPLEDIR/run_domain.sh\n+  ```\n+\n+At the end, you will see the message `Getting pod status - ctrl-c when all is running and ready to exit`. Then you should see a WebLogic Administration Server and two Managed Server pods start. After all the pods are up, you can use `ctrl-c` to exit the build script.\n+\n+\n+### Optionally test the sample application\n+\n+1. Ensure Traefik has been installed and is servicing external port 30305, as per [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).\n+\n+2. Create a Kubernetes Ingress for the domain's WebLogic cluster in the domain's namespace by using the sample Helm chart:\n+\n+   For Helm 2.x:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd $SRCDIR\n+   $ helm install kubernetes/samples/charts/ingress-per-domain \\\n+     --name sample-domain1-ingress \\\n+     --namespace sample-domain1-ns \\\n+     --set wlsDomain.domainUID=sample-domain1 \\\n+     --set traefik.hostname=sample-domain1.org\n+   ```\n+\n+   For Helm 3.x:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd $SRCDIR\n+   helm install sample-domain1-ingress kubernetes/samples/charts/ingress-per-domain \\\n+    --namespace sample-domain1-ns \\\n+    --set wlsDomain.domainUID=sample-domain1 \\\n+    --set traefik.hostname=sample-domain1.org\n+   ```\n+\n+   This creates an Kubernetes Ingress that helps route HTTP traffic from the Traefik load balancer's external port 30305 to the WebLogic domain's `cluster-1` 8001 port. Note that the WDT config map in this sample changes the cluster's port from 9001 to 8001 (9001 is the original port configured using the WDT model defined within in the image).\n+\n+3. Send a web application request to the load balancer:\n+\n+   ```\n+   curl -H 'host: sample-domain1.org' http://$(hostname).$(dnsdomainname):30305/sample_war/index.jsp\n+   ```\n+\n+   You should see something like the following:\n+\n+   ```\n+   Hello World, you have reached server managed-server1\n+   ```\n+\n+   **Note**: If you're running on a remote Kubernetes cluster, then substitute `$(hostname).$(dnsdomainname)` with an external address suitable for contacting the cluster.\n+\n+4. Send a ReadyApp request to the load balancer (ReadyApp is a built-in WebLogic Server application):\n+\n+   ```\n+   curl -v -H 'host: sample-domain1.org' http://$(hostname).$(dnsdomainname):30305/weblogic/ready\n+   ```\n+\n+   You should see something like the following:\n+\n+\n+   ```\n+   * About to connect() to myhost.my.dns.domain.name port 30305 (#0)\n+   *   Trying 100.111.142.32...\n+   * Connected to myhost.my.dns.domain.name (100.111.142.32) port 30305 (#0)\n+   > GET /weblogic/ready HTTP/1.1\n+   > User-Agent: curl/7.29.0\n+   > Accept: */*\n+   > host: sample-domain1.org\n+   >\n+   < HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n+   < Content-Length: 0\n+   < Date: Mon, 09 Mar 2020 20:40:37 GMT\n+   < Vary: Accept-Encoding\n+   <\n+   * Connection #0 to host myhost.my.dns.domain.name left intact\n+   ```\n+\n+   **Note**: If you're running on a remote Kubernetes cluster, then substitute `$(hostname).$(dnsdomainname)` with an external address suitable for contacting the cluster.\n+\n+### Optionally access the WebLogic console\n+\n+You can add an ingress rule to access the WebLogic Console from your local browser\n+\n+1. Find out the service name of the admin server and service port number.\n+\n+The name follows the pattern <Domain UID>-<admin server name> all lower case and the port number will be described in your \n+WDT model's admin server `listenPort`.\n+\n+You can also find the information by:\n+\n+```\n+kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns get services\n+```\n+\n+```\n+NAME                               TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE\n+sample-domain1-admin-server        ClusterIP   None           <none>        7001/TCP   48m\n+```\n+\n+This shows the admin service name is `sample-domain1-admin-server` and the port for the console is `7001`\n+\n+2. Create an ingress rule for the WebLogic console\n+\n+Create the following file and call it `console-ingress.yaml` in your `$WORKDIR`.\n+\n+```\n+apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\n+kind: Ingress\n+metadata:\n+  name: sample-domain1-console-ingress\n+  namespace: sample-domain1-ns\n+  annotations:\n+    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: traefik\n+spec:\n+  rules:\n+  - host:\n+    http:\n+      paths:\n+      - path: /console\n+        backend:\n+          serviceName: sample-domain1-admin-server\n+          servicePort: 7001\n+\n+```\n+\n+This will route the request path `/console` to the admin service port `7001` at pod `sample-domain1-admin-server` in the `sample-domain1-ns` namespace.\n+\n+3.

Similarly, `RestrictedJRF` domains may be used by Oracle layered products such as Oracle Communications products.\n+\n+### References\n+\n+To reference the relevant user documentation, see:\n+ - [Model in Image User Guide]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) user documentation\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Server Deploy Tooling](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling)\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool)\n+\n+\n+\n+### Prerequisites for all domain types\n+\n+1. The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable must be set and must reference a valid JDK 8 installation. (`JAVA_HOME` is used by the WebLogic Image Tool.)\n+\n+2. Set a source directory environment variable `SRCDIR` that references the parent of the operator source tree. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   mkdir ~/wlopsrc\n+   cd ~/wlopsrc\n+   git clone https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator.git\n+   export SRCDIR=$(pwd)/weblogic-kubernetes-operator\n+   ```\n+\n+   For additional information about obtaining the operator source, see the [Developer Guide Requirements](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/developerguide/requirements/).\n+\n+3. Create a sample directory environment variable `SAMPLEDIR` that references this sample's directory:\n+\n+   ```\n+   export SAMPLEDIR=${SRCDIR}/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image/\n+   ```\n+\n+4. Create an empty, temporary working directory with 10g of space, and store its location in the `WORKDIR` environment variable. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd <location of empty temporary directory with 10g of space>\n+   export WORKDIR=$(pwd)\n+   ```\n+\n+5. Deploy the operator and set up the operator to manage the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`. Optionally, deploy a Traefik load balancer that manages the same namespace. For example, follow the same steps as the [Quick Start](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/quickstart/), up through the [Prepare for a domain]({{< relref \"/quickstart/prepare.md\" >}}) step.\n+\n+   Note that:\n+   - Deploying the Traefik load balancer is optional, but is a prerequisite for testing the web application that's deployed to WebLogic as part of this sample.\n+   - You can skip the Quick Start steps for obtaining a WebLogic image because you will be creating your own Docker image.\n+\n+\n+6. Choose the type of domain you're going to create: `WLS`, `JRF`, or `RestrictedJRF`, and set the environment variable, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, accordingly. The default is `WLS`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   export WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE=<one of WLS, JRF, or RestrictedJRF>\n+   ```\n+\n+7. Set up access to a base image for this sample that will be used as the base image for creating the final image. Do one of the following:\n+\n+   - __Option 1, download an existing WebLogic image.__\n+\n+     Set up access to this sample's base WebLogic image at the [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com):\n+\n+     a. Use a browser to access [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com).\n+\n+     b. Choose an image location:\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF` domains, select `Middleware`, then `fmw-infrastructure`.\n+       - For `WLS` domains, select `Middleware`, then `weblogic`.\n+\n+     c. Select Sign In and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+     d. Use your terminal to locally log in to Docker: `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+\n+     e. Later, when you run the sample, it will call `docker pull` for your base image based on the domain type.\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4`.\n+       - For `WLS`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4`.\n+\n+   - __Option 2, create your own WebLogic base image.__\n+\n+     Alternatively, you can create your own base image and override the sample's default base image name and tag by exporting the `BASE_IMAGE_NAME` and `BASE_IMAGE_TAG` environment variables prior to running the sample scripts. If you want to create your own base image, see [Preparing a Base Image]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-in-image/base-images/_index.md\" >}}).\n+\n+8. If you are using a `JRF` domain type, then it requires an RCU infrastructure database. See [Prerequisites for JRF Domains](#prerequisites-for-jrf-domains). You can do this step before or after you create your final image. If you're not using a `JRF` domain type, proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image).\n+\n+### Prerequisites for JRF domains\n+\n+> __NOTE__: This section is only required for demonstrating a `JRF` domain type. Skip this section and proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image) if your domain type is `WLS` or `RestrictedJRF`.\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database called an RCU database, requires initializing this database, and requires configuring your domain to access this database. All of these steps must occur before you first deploy your domain.\n+\n+Furthermore, if you want to have a restarted JRF domain access updates to the infrastructure database that the domain made at an earlier time, the restarted domain must be supplied a wallet file that was obtained from a previous run of the domain.\n+\n+The following steps demonstrate how to set up an infrastructure database that will work with this sample:\n+\n+  1. [Set up and initialize an RCU database](#set-up-and-initialize-an-rcu-database).\n+  2. [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout).\n+  3. [Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets](#set-up-rcu-model-attributes-domain-resource-attributes-and-secrets).\n+  4. [Reusing or sharing RCU tables](#reusing-or-sharing-rcu-tables).\n+\n+\n+\n+##### Set up and initialize an RCU database\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database and also requires initializing this database with a schema and a set of tables. The following example shows how to set up a sample RCU database and use the RCU tool to create the infrastructure schema for a JRF domain. The RCU database is set up with the following attributes:\n+\n+| Attribute | Value |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| database Kubernetes namespace | `default` |\n+| database Kubernetes pod | `oracle-db` |\n+| database image | `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` |\n+| database password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| infrastructure schema prefix | `FMW1` |\n+| infrastructure schema password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| database URL | `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s` |\n+\n+\n+1. Ensure you have access to the database image, and then deploy it:\n+\n+   - Use a browser to log in to `https://container-registry.oracle.com`, select `database->enterprise` and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+   - Get the database image:\n+     - In the local shell, `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+     - In the local shell, `docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim`.\n+\n+\n+       {{% notice note %}} If a local Docker login and manual pull of `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` is not sufficient (for example, if you are using a remote Kubernetes cluster), then uncomment the `imagePullSecrets` stanza in `$WORKDIR/k8s-db-slim.yaml` and create the image pull secret as follows:\n+\n+              ```\n+              kubectl create secret docker-registry regsecret \\\n+                --docker-server=container-registry.oracle.com \\\n+                --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+                --docker-password=your-password \\\n+                --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+              ```\n+       {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+\n+   - Use the sample script in `$SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service` to create an Oracle database running in the pod, `oracle-db`.\n+\n+      **NOTE**: If your database image access requires the `regsecret` image pull secret that you optionally created above, then pass `-s regsecret` to the `start-db-service.sh` command line.\n+\n+     ```\n+     cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service\n+     start-db-service.sh\n+     ```\n+\n+     This script will deploy a database with the URL, `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`, and administration password, `Oradoc_db1`.\n+\n+     {{% notice warning %}} The Oracle database Docker images are supported only for non-production use. For more details, see My Oracle Support note: Oracle Support for Database Running on Docker (Doc ID 2216342.1) : All the data is gone when the database is restarted.\n+     {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+     **NOTE**: This step is based on the steps documented in [Run a Database](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/userguide/overview/database/).\n+\n+2. Use the sample script in `SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema` to create the RCU schema with the schema prefix `FMW1`.\n+\n+   Note that this script assumes `Oradoc_db1` is the DBA password, `Oradoc_db1` is the schema password, and that the database URL is `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema\n+   ./create-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1 -i container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4\n+   ```\n+\n+   __NOTE__:  If you need to drop the repository, use this command:\n+\n+   ```\n+   drop-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1\n+   ```\n+\n+\n+##### Increase introspection job timeout\n+\n+Because JRF domain home creation takes a considerable amount of time the first time it is created, and because Model in Image creates your domain home for you using the introspection job, you should increase the timeout for the introspection job. Use the `configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds` in `k8s-domain.yaml.template` to override the default with a value of at least 300 seconds (the default is 120 seconds).  \n+\n+##### Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets\n+\n+To allow Model in Image to access the RCU database and OPSS wallet, it's necessary to set up an RCU access secret and an OPSS secret before deploying your domain. It's also necessary to define an `RCUDbInfo` stanza in your model. The sample already sets up all of these for you.  See:\n+\n+| Sample file | Description |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, with `password=welcome1`. |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, with appropriate values for attributes `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string`. |\n+| `model1.yaml.jrf` | Populates the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string` attributes by referencing their locations in the `sample-domain1-rcu-access` secret. The `build.sh` script uses this model instead of `model.yaml.wls` when the source domain type is `JRF`. |\n+| `k8s-domain.yaml.template` | Ensures that the domain mounts the OPSS key secret by setting the domain resource `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` attribute to `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, and ensures the domain mounts the RCU access secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, for reference by WDT model macros by setting the domain resource `configuration.secrets` attribute. Use configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds to increase the timeout value of the introspector job; see [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout). |\n+\n+ **NOTE**: This step is for information purposes only. Do not run the above sample files directly. The sample's main build and run scripts will run them for you.\n+\n+##### Reusing or sharing RCU tables\n+\n+Note that when you succesfully deploy your JRF domain resource for the first time, the introspector job will initialize the RCU tables for the domain using the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza in the WDT model plus the `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` specified in the domain resource. The job will also create a new domain home. Finally, the operator will also capture an OPSS wallet file from the new domain's local directory and place this file in a new Kubernetes config map.\n+\n+There are scenarios when the domain needs to be re-created between updates such as WebLogic credentials are changed, security roles defined in the WDT model have been changed or you want to share the same RCU tables with different domains.  Under these scenarios, the operator needs the `walletPasswordSecret` as well as the OPSS wallet file, together with the exact information in `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` so that the domain can be re-created and access the same set of RCU tables.  Without the wallet file and wallet password, you will not be able to re-create a domain accessing the same set of RCU tables, therefore it is highly recommended to backup the wallet file.\n+\n+To recover a domain's RCU tables between domain restarts or to share an RCU schema between different domains, it is necessary to extract this wallet file from the config map and save the OPSS wallet password secret that was used for the original domain. The wallet password and wallet file are needed again when you recreate the domain or share the database with other domains.\n+\n+To save the wallet file:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -s [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>]\n+```\n+\n+You should back up this file to a safe location that can be retrieved later.\n+\n+To reuse the wallet for subsequent redeployments or share the RCU tables between different domains:\n+\n+1. Store the wallet in a secret:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -r [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>] [-ws <name of the secret. Default DOMAIN_UID-opss-walletfile-secret> ]\n+\n+```\n+\n+2. Modify the domain resource YAML file to provide the secret names:\n+\n+```\n+  configuration:\n+    opss:\n+      # Name of secret with walletPassword for extracting the wallet\n+      walletPasswordSecret: sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret      \n+      # Name of secret with walletFile containing base64 encoded opss wallet\n+      walletFileSecret: sample-domain1-opss-walletfile-secret\n+\n+```\n+\n+See [Reusing an RCU database]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/reusing-rcu.md\" >}}) for instructions.\n+\n+### Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image\n+\n+Model in Image must contain a WebLogic install, a WebLogic Deploy Tool install, and your WDT model files. You can use the sample `./build.sh` script to build this image, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Uses `docker pull` to obtain a base image. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types) to set up access to the base image.)\n+  - Downloads the latest WebLogic Image Tool and WebLogic Deploy Tool to `WORKDIR`.\n+  - Creates and populates a staging directory `$WORKDIR/models` that contains your WDT model files and WDT application archive.\n+    - Builds  a simple servlet application in `$SAMPLEDIR/sample_app` into a WDT model application archive `$WORKDIR/models/archive1.zip`.\n+    - Copies sample model files from `$SAMPLEDIR/model-in-image` to `$WORKDIR/models`. This uses a model file that is appropriate to the domain type (for example, the `JRF` domain model includes database access configuration).\n+  - Uses the WebLogic Image Tool and the `$WORKDIR/models` staging directory to create a final image named `model-in-image:v1` that layers on the base image. Specifically, it runs the WebLogic Image Tool with its `update` option, which:\n+    - Builds the final image as a layer on the base image.\n+    - Puts a WDT install in image location, `/u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy`.\n+    - Copies the WDT model, properties, and application archive from `$WORDKIR/models` to image location, `/u01/wdt/models`.\n+\n+The script expects `JAVA_HOME`, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).)\n+\n+Run the script:\n+\n+  ```\n+  $SAMPLEDIR/build.sh\n+  ```\n+\n+If you intend to use a remote Docker registry, you need to tag and push the image to the remote Docker registry.\n+\n+1.  Tag the image for the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker tag <image-name>:<tag> <region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>:<tag>\n+```\n+\n+2.  Push the image to the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker push <region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>:<tag>\n+```\n+\n+3. Create the pull secret for the remote Docker registry:\n+\n+```\n+ kubectl -n <domain namespace> create secret docker-registry <secret name> \\\n+     --docker-server=<region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name> \\\n+     --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+     --docker-password=your-password \\\n+     --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+\n+```\n+\n+4. Update the domain template file `$SAMPLEDIR/k8s-domain.yaml.template` to provide the `imagePullSecrets`:\n+\n+```\n+  imagePullSecrets:\n+  - name: <secret name>\n+\n+```\n+\n+5. Export the environment variables for the image name and tag using the same values in step 1:\n+\n+```\n+export MODEL_IMAGE_NAME=\"<region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>\"\n+export MODEL_IMAGE_TAG=\"<tag>\"\n+```\n+\n+### Create and deploy your Kubernetes resources\n+\n+To deploy the sample operator domain and its required Kubernetes resources, use the sample script, `$SAMPLEDIR/run_domain.sh`, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Deletes the domain with a `DomainUID` of `domain1` in the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`, if it already exists.\n+  - Creates a secret containing your WebLogic administrator user name and password.\n+  - Creates a secret containing your Model in Image runtime encryption password:\n+    - All model-in-image domains must supply a runtime encryption secret with a `password` value.\n+    - It is used to encrypt configuration that is passed around internally by the Operator.\n+    - The value must be kept private but can be arbitrary: you can optionally supply a different secret value every time you restart the domain.\n+  - Creates secrets containing your RCU access URL, credentials, and prefix (these are unused unless the domain type is `JRF`).\n+  - Creates a config map containing an additional WDT model properties file, `$SAMPLEDIR/model1.20.properties`.\n+  - Generates a domain resource YAML file, `$WORKDIR/k8s-domain.yaml`, using `$SAMPLEDIR/k8s-domain.yaml.template`.\n+  - Deploys `k8s-domain.yaml`.\n+  - Displays the status of the domain pods.\n+\n+The script expects `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE` and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).)\n+\n+Run the script:\n+\n+  ```\n+  $SAMPLEDIR/run_domain.sh\n+  ```\n+\n+At the end, you will see the message `Getting pod status - ctrl-c when all is running and ready to exit`. Then you should see a WebLogic Administration Server and two Managed Server pods start. After all the pods are up, you can use `ctrl-c` to exit the build script.\n+\n+\n+### Optionally test the sample application\n+\n+1. Ensure Traefik has been installed and is servicing external port 30305, as per [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).\n+\n+2. Create a Kubernetes Ingress for the domain's WebLogic cluster in the domain's namespace by using the sample Helm chart:\n+\n+   For Helm 2.x:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd $SRCDIR\n+   $ helm install kubernetes/samples/charts/ingress-per-domain \\\n+     --name sample-domain1-ingress \\\n+     --namespace sample-domain1-ns \\\n+     --set wlsDomain.domainUID=sample-domain1 \\\n+     --set traefik.hostname=sample-domain1.org\n+   ```\n+\n+   For Helm 3.x:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd $SRCDIR\n+   helm install sample-domain1-ingress kubernetes/samples/charts/ingress-per-domain \\\n+    --namespace sample-domain1-ns \\\n+    --set wlsDomain.domainUID=sample-domain1 \\\n+    --set traefik.hostname=sample-domain1.org\n+   ```\n+\n+   This creates an Kubernetes Ingress that helps route HTTP traffic from the Traefik load balancer's external port 30305 to the WebLogic domain's `cluster-1` 8001 port. Note that the WDT config map in this sample changes the cluster's port from 9001 to 8001 (9001 is the original port configured using the WDT model defined within in the image).\n+\n+3. Send a web application request to the load balancer:\n+\n+   ```\n+   curl -H 'host: sample-domain1.org' http://$(hostname).$(dnsdomainname):30305/sample_war/index.jsp\n+   ```\n+\n+   You should see something like the following:\n+\n+   ```\n+   Hello World, you have reached server managed-server1\n+   ```\n+\n+   **Note**: If you're running on a remote Kubernetes cluster, then substitute `$(hostname).$(dnsdomainname)` with an external address suitable for contacting the cluster.\n+\n+4. Send a ReadyApp request to the load balancer (ReadyApp is a built-in WebLogic Server application):\n+\n+   ```\n+   curl -v -H 'host: sample-domain1.org' http://$(hostname).$(dnsdomainname):30305/weblogic/ready\n+   ```\n+\n+   You should see something like the following:\n+\n+\n+   ```\n+   * About to connect() to myhost.my.dns.domain.name port 30305 (#0)\n+   *   Trying 100.111.142.32...\n+   * Connected to myhost.my.dns.domain.name (100.111.142.32) port 30305 (#0)\n+   > GET /weblogic/ready HTTP/1.1\n+   > User-Agent: curl/7.29.0\n+   > Accept: */*\n+   > host: sample-domain1.org\n+   >\n+   < HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n+   < Content-Length: 0\n+   < Date: Mon, 09 Mar 2020 20:40:37 GMT\n+   < Vary: Accept-Encoding\n+   <\n+   * Connection #0 to host myhost.my.dns.domain.name left intact\n+   ```\n+\n+   **Note**: If you're running on a remote Kubernetes cluster, then substitute `$(hostname).$(dnsdomainname)` with an external address suitable for contacting the cluster.\n+\n+### Optionally access the WebLogic console\n+\n+You can add an ingress rule to access the WebLogic Console from your local browser\n+\n+1. Find out the service name of the admin server and service port number.\n+\n+The name follows the pattern <Domain UID>-<admin server name> all lower case and the port number will be described in your \n+WDT model's admin server `listenPort`.\n+\n+You can also find the information by:\n+\n+```\n+kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns get services\n+```\n+\n+```\n+NAME                               TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE\n+sample-domain1-admin-server        ClusterIP   None           <none>        7001/TCP   48m\n+```\n+\n+This shows the admin service name is `sample-domain1-admin-server` and the port for the console is `7001`\n+\n+2. Create an ingress rule for the WebLogic console\n+\n+Create the following file and call it `console-ingress.yaml` in your `$WORKDIR`.\n+\n+```\n+apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\n+kind: Ingress\n+metadata:\n+  name: sample-domain1-console-ingress\n+  namespace: sample-domain1-ns\n+  annotations:\n+    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: traefik\n+spec:\n+  rules:\n+  - host:\n+    http:\n+      paths:\n+      - path: /console\n+        backend:\n+          serviceName: sample-domain1-admin-server\n+          servicePort: 7001\n+\n+```\n+\n+This will route the request path `/console` to the admin service port `7001` at pod `sample-domain1-admin-server` in the `sample-domain1-ns` namespace.\n+\n+3.

Similarly, `RestrictedJRF` domains may be used by Oracle layered products such as Oracle Communications products.\n+\n+### References\n+\n+To reference the relevant user documentation, see:\n+ - [Model in Image User Guide]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) user documentation\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Server Deploy Tooling](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling)\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool)\n+\n+\n+\n+### Prerequisites for all domain types\n+\n+1. The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable must be set and must reference a valid JDK 8 installation. (`JAVA_HOME` is used by the WebLogic Image Tool.)\n+\n+2. Set a source directory environment variable `SRCDIR` that references the parent of the operator source tree. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   mkdir ~/wlopsrc\n+   cd ~/wlopsrc\n+   git clone https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator.git\n+   export SRCDIR=$(pwd)/weblogic-kubernetes-operator\n+   ```\n+\n+   For additional information about obtaining the operator source, see the [Developer Guide Requirements](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/developerguide/requirements/).\n+\n+3. Create a sample directory environment variable `SAMPLEDIR` that references this sample's directory:\n+\n+   ```\n+   export SAMPLEDIR=${SRCDIR}/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image/\n+   ```\n+\n+4. Create an empty, temporary working directory with 10g of space, and store its location in the `WORKDIR` environment variable. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd <location of empty temporary directory with 10g of space>\n+   export WORKDIR=$(pwd)\n+   ```\n+\n+5. Deploy the operator and set up the operator to manage the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`. Optionally, deploy a Traefik load balancer that manages the same namespace. For example, follow the same steps as the [Quick Start](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/quickstart/), up through the [Prepare for a domain]({{< relref \"/quickstart/prepare.md\" >}}) step.\n+\n+   Note that:\n+   - Deploying the Traefik load balancer is optional, but is a prerequisite for testing the web application that's deployed to WebLogic as part of this sample.\n+   - You can skip the Quick Start steps for obtaining a WebLogic image because you will be creating your own Docker image.\n+\n+\n+6. Choose the type of domain you're going to create: `WLS`, `JRF`, or `RestrictedJRF`, and set the environment variable, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, accordingly. The default is `WLS`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   export WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE=<one of WLS, JRF, or RestrictedJRF>\n+   ```\n+\n+7. Set up access to a base image for this sample that will be used as the base image for creating the final image. Do one of the following:\n+\n+   - __Option 1, download an existing WebLogic image.__\n+\n+     Set up access to this sample's base WebLogic image at the [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com):\n+\n+     a. Use a browser to access [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com).\n+\n+     b. Choose an image location:\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF` domains, select `Middleware`, then `fmw-infrastructure`.\n+       - For `WLS` domains, select `Middleware`, then `weblogic`.\n+\n+     c. Select Sign In and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+     d. Use your terminal to locally log in to Docker: `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+\n+     e. Later, when you run the sample, it will call `docker pull` for your base image based on the domain type.\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4`.\n+       - For `WLS`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4`.\n+\n+   - __Option 2, create your own WebLogic base image.__\n+\n+     Alternatively, you can create your own base image and override the sample's default base image name and tag by exporting the `BASE_IMAGE_NAME` and `BASE_IMAGE_TAG` environment variables prior to running the sample scripts. If you want to create your own base image, see [Preparing a Base Image]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-in-image/base-images/_index.md\" >}}).\n+\n+8. If you are using a `JRF` domain type, then it requires an RCU infrastructure database. See [Prerequisites for JRF Domains](#prerequisites-for-jrf-domains). You can do this step before or after you create your final image. If you're not using a `JRF` domain type, proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image).\n+\n+### Prerequisites for JRF domains\n+\n+> __NOTE__: This section is only required for demonstrating a `JRF` domain type. Skip this section and proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image) if your domain type is `WLS` or `RestrictedJRF`.\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database called an RCU database, requires initializing this database, and requires configuring your domain to access this database. All of these steps must occur before you first deploy your domain.\n+\n+Furthermore, if you want to have a restarted JRF domain access updates to the infrastructure database that the domain made at an earlier time, the restarted domain must be supplied a wallet file that was obtained from a previous run of the domain.\n+\n+The following steps demonstrate how to set up an infrastructure database that will work with this sample:\n+\n+  1. [Set up and initialize an RCU database](#set-up-and-initialize-an-rcu-database).\n+  2. [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout).\n+  3. [Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets](#set-up-rcu-model-attributes-domain-resource-attributes-and-secrets).\n+  4. [Reusing or sharing RCU tables](#reusing-or-sharing-rcu-tables).\n+\n+\n+\n+##### Set up and initialize an RCU database\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database and also requires initializing this database with a schema and a set of tables. The following example shows how to set up a sample RCU database and use the RCU tool to create the infrastructure schema for a JRF domain. The RCU database is set up with the following attributes:\n+\n+| Attribute | Value |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| database Kubernetes namespace | `default` |\n+| database Kubernetes pod | `oracle-db` |\n+| database image | `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` |\n+| database password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| infrastructure schema prefix | `FMW1` |\n+| infrastructure schema password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| database URL | `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s` |\n+\n+\n+1. Ensure you have access to the database image, and then deploy it:\n+\n+   - Use a browser to log in to `https://container-registry.oracle.com`, select `database->enterprise` and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+   - Get the database image:\n+     - In the local shell, `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+     - In the local shell, `docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim`.\n+\n+\n+       {{% notice note %}} If a local Docker login and manual pull of `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` is not sufficient (for example, if you are using a remote Kubernetes cluster), then uncomment the `imagePullSecrets` stanza in `$WORKDIR/k8s-db-slim.yaml` and create the image pull secret as follows:\n+\n+              ```\n+              kubectl create secret docker-registry regsecret \\\n+                --docker-server=container-registry.oracle.com \\\n+                --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+                --docker-password=your-password \\\n+                --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+              ```\n+       {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+\n+   - Use the sample script in `$SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service` to create an Oracle database running in the pod, `oracle-db`.\n+\n+      **NOTE**: If your database image access requires the `regsecret` image pull secret that you optionally created above, then pass `-s regsecret` to the `start-db-service.sh` command line.\n+\n+     ```\n+     cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service\n+     start-db-service.sh\n+     ```\n+\n+     This script will deploy a database with the URL, `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`, and administration password, `Oradoc_db1`.\n+\n+     {{% notice warning %}} The Oracle database Docker images are supported only for non-production use. For more details, see My Oracle Support note: Oracle Support for Database Running on Docker (Doc ID 2216342.1) : All the data is gone when the database is restarted.\n+     {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+     **NOTE**: This step is based on the steps documented in [Run a Database](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/userguide/overview/database/).\n+\n+2. Use the sample script in `SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema` to create the RCU schema with the schema prefix `FMW1`.\n+\n+   Note that this script assumes `Oradoc_db1` is the DBA password, `Oradoc_db1` is the schema password, and that the database URL is `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema\n+   ./create-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1 -i container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4\n+   ```\n+\n+   __NOTE__:  If you need to drop the repository, use this command:\n+\n+   ```\n+   drop-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1\n+   ```\n+\n+\n+##### Increase introspection job timeout\n+\n+Because JRF domain home creation takes a considerable amount of time the first time it is created, and because Model in Image creates your domain home for you using the introspection job, you should increase the timeout for the introspection job. Use the `configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds` in `k8s-domain.yaml.template` to override the default with a value of at least 300 seconds (the default is 120 seconds).  \n+\n+##### Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets\n+\n+To allow Model in Image to access the RCU database and OPSS wallet, it's necessary to set up an RCU access secret and an OPSS secret before deploying your domain. It's also necessary to define an `RCUDbInfo` stanza in your model. The sample already sets up all of these for you.  See:\n+\n+| Sample file | Description |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, with `password=welcome1`. |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, with appropriate values for attributes `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string`. |\n+| `model1.yaml.jrf` | Populates the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string` attributes by referencing their locations in the `sample-domain1-rcu-access` secret. The `build.sh` script uses this model instead of `model.yaml.wls` when the source domain type is `JRF`. |\n+| `k8s-domain.yaml.template` | Ensures that the domain mounts the OPSS key secret by setting the domain resource `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` attribute to `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, and ensures the domain mounts the RCU access secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, for reference by WDT model macros by setting the domain resource `configuration.secrets` attribute. Use configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds to increase the timeout value of the introspector job; see [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout). |\n+\n+ **NOTE**: This step is for information purposes only. Do not run the above sample files directly. The sample's main build and run scripts will run them for you.\n+\n+##### Reusing or sharing RCU tables\n+\n+Note that when you succesfully deploy your JRF domain resource for the first time, the introspector job will initialize the RCU tables for the domain using the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza in the WDT model plus the `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` specified in the domain resource. The job will also create a new domain home. Finally, the operator will also capture an OPSS wallet file from the new domain's local directory and place this file in a new Kubernetes config map.\n+\n+There are scenarios when the domain needs to be re-created between updates such as WebLogic credentials are changed, security roles defined in the WDT model have been changed or you want to share the same RCU tables with different domains.  Under these scenarios, the operator needs the `walletPasswordSecret` as well as the OPSS wallet file, together with the exact information in `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` so that the domain can be re-created and access the same set of RCU tables.  Without the wallet file and wallet password, you will not be able to re-create a domain accessing the same set of RCU tables, therefore it is highly recommended to backup the wallet file.\n+\n+To recover a domain's RCU tables between domain restarts or to share an RCU schema between different domains, it is necessary to extract this wallet file from the config map and save the OPSS wallet password secret that was used for the original domain. The wallet password and wallet file are needed again when you recreate the domain or share the database with other domains.\n+\n+To save the wallet file:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -s [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>]\n+```\n+\n+You should back up this file to a safe location that can be retrieved later.\n+\n+To reuse the wallet for subsequent redeployments or share the RCU tables between different domains:\n+\n+1. Store the wallet in a secret:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -r [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>] [-ws <name of the secret. Default DOMAIN_UID-opss-walletfile-secret> ]\n+\n+```\n+\n+2. Modify the domain resource YAML file to provide the secret names:\n+\n+```\n+  configuration:\n+    opss:\n+      # Name of secret with walletPassword for extracting the wallet\n+      walletPasswordSecret: sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret      \n+      # Name of secret with walletFile containing base64 encoded opss wallet\n+      walletFileSecret: sample-domain1-opss-walletfile-secret\n+\n+```\n+\n+See [Reusing an RCU database]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/reusing-rcu.md\" >}}) for instructions.\n+\n+### Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image\n+\n+Model in Image must contain a WebLogic install, a WebLogic Deploy Tool install, and your WDT model files. You can use the sample `./build.sh` script to build this image, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Uses `docker pull` to obtain a base image. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types) to set up access to the base image.)\n+  - Downloads the latest WebLogic Image Tool and WebLogic Deploy Tool to `WORKDIR`.\n+  - Creates and populates a staging directory `$WORKDIR/models` that contains your WDT model files and WDT application archive.\n+    - Builds  a simple servlet application in `$SAMPLEDIR/sample_app` into a WDT model application archive `$WORKDIR/models/archive1.zip`.\n+    - Copies sample model files from `$SAMPLEDIR/model-in-image` to `$WORKDIR/models`. This uses a model file that is appropriate to the domain type (for example, the `JRF` domain model includes database access configuration).\n+  - Uses the WebLogic Image Tool and the `$WORKDIR/models` staging directory to create a final image named `model-in-image:v1` that layers on the base image. Specifically, it runs the WebLogic Image Tool with its `update` option, which:\n+    - Builds the final image as a layer on the base image.\n+    - Puts a WDT install in image location, `/u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy`.\n+    - Copies the WDT model, properties, and application archive from `$WORDKIR/models` to image location, `/u01/wdt/models`.\n+\n+The script expects `JAVA_HOME`, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).)\n+\n+Run the script:\n+\n+  ```\n+  $SAMPLEDIR/build.sh\n+  ```\n+\n+If you intend to use a remote Docker registry, you need to tag and push the image to the remote Docker registry.\n+\n+1.  Tag the image for the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker tag <image-name>:<tag> <region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>:<tag>\n+```\n+\n+2.  Push the image to the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker push <region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>:<tag>\n+```\n+\n+3. Create the pull secret for the remote Docker registry:\n+\n+```\n+ kubectl -n <domain namespace> create secret docker-registry <secret name> \\\n+     --docker-server=<region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name> \\\n+     --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+     --docker-password=your-password \\\n+     --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+\n+```\n+\n+4. Update the domain template file `$SAMPLEDIR/k8s-domain.yaml.template` to provide the `imagePullSecrets`:\n+\n+```\n+  imagePullSecrets:\n+  - name: <secret name>\n+\n+```\n+\n+5. Export the environment variables for the image name and tag using the same values in step 1:\n+\n+```\n+export MODEL_IMAGE_NAME=\"<region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>\"\n+export MODEL_IMAGE_TAG=\"<tag>\"\n+```\n+\n+### Create and deploy your Kubernetes resources\n+\n+To deploy the sample operator domain and its required Kubernetes resources, use the sample script, `$SAMPLEDIR/run_domain.sh`, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Deletes the domain with a `DomainUID` of `domain1` in the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`, if it already exists.\n+  - Creates a secret containing your WebLogic administrator user name and password.\n+  - Creates a secret containing your Model in Image runtime encryption password:\n+    - All model-in-image domains must supply a runtime encryption secret with a `password` value.\n+    - It is used to encrypt configuration that is passed around internally by the Operator.\n+    - The value must be kept private but can be arbitrary: you can optionally supply a different secret value every time you restart the domain.\n+  - Creates secrets containing your RCU access URL, credentials, and prefix (these are unused unless the domain type is `JRF`).\n+  - Creates a config map containing an additional WDT model properties file, `$SAMPLEDIR/model1.20.properties`.\n+  - Generates a domain resource YAML file, `$WORKDIR/k8s-domain.yaml`, using `$SAMPLEDIR/k8s-domain.yaml.template`.\n+  - Deploys `k8s-domain.yaml`.\n+  - Displays the status of the domain pods.\n+\n+The script expects `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE` and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).)\n+\n+Run the script:\n+\n+  ```\n+  $SAMPLEDIR/run_domain.sh\n+  ```\n+\n+At the end, you will see the message `Getting pod status - ctrl-c when all is running and ready to exit`. Then you should see a WebLogic Administration Server and two Managed Server pods start. After all the pods are up, you can use `ctrl-c` to exit the build script.\n+\n+\n+### Optionally test the sample application\n+\n+1. Ensure Traefik has been installed and is servicing external port 30305, as per [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).\n+\n+2. Create a Kubernetes Ingress for the domain's WebLogic cluster in the domain's namespace by using the sample Helm chart:\n+\n+   For Helm 2.x:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd $SRCDIR\n+   $ helm install kubernetes/samples/charts/ingress-per-domain \\\n+     --name sample-domain1-ingress \\\n+     --namespace sample-domain1-ns \\\n+     --set wlsDomain.domainUID=sample-domain1 \\\n+     --set traefik.hostname=sample-domain1.org\n+   ```\n+\n+   For Helm 3.x:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd $SRCDIR\n+   helm install sample-domain1-ingress kubernetes/samples/charts/ingress-per-domain \\\n+    --namespace sample-domain1-ns \\\n+    --set wlsDomain.domainUID=sample-domain1 \\\n+    --set traefik.hostname=sample-domain1.org\n+   ```\n+\n+   This creates an Kubernetes Ingress that helps route HTTP traffic from the Traefik load balancer's external port 30305 to the WebLogic domain's `cluster-1` 8001 port. Note that the WDT config map in this sample changes the cluster's port from 9001 to 8001 (9001 is the original port configured using the WDT model defined within in the image).\n+\n+3. Send a web application request to the load balancer:\n+\n+   ```\n+   curl -H 'host: sample-domain1.org' http://$(hostname).$(dnsdomainname):30305/sample_war/index.jsp\n+   ```\n+\n+   You should see something like the following:\n+\n+   ```\n+   Hello World, you have reached server managed-server1\n+   ```\n+\n+   **Note**: If you're running on a remote Kubernetes cluster, then substitute `$(hostname).$(dnsdomainname)` with an external address suitable for contacting the cluster.\n+\n+4. Send a ReadyApp request to the load balancer (ReadyApp is a built-in WebLogic Server application):\n+\n+   ```\n+   curl -v -H 'host: sample-domain1.org' http://$(hostname).$(dnsdomainname):30305/weblogic/ready\n+   ```\n+\n+   You should see something like the following:\n+\n+\n+   ```\n+   * About to connect() to myhost.my.dns.domain.name port 30305 (#0)\n+   *   Trying 100.111.142.32...\n+   * Connected to myhost.my.dns.domain.name (100.111.142.32) port 30305 (#0)\n+   > GET /weblogic/ready HTTP/1.1\n+   > User-Agent: curl/7.29.0\n+   > Accept: */*\n+   > host: sample-domain1.org\n+   >\n+   < HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n+   < Content-Length: 0\n+   < Date: Mon, 09 Mar 2020 20:40:37 GMT\n+   < Vary: Accept-Encoding\n+   <\n+   * Connection #0 to host myhost.my.dns.domain.name left intact\n+   ```\n+\n+   **Note**: If you're running on a remote Kubernetes cluster, then substitute `$(hostname).$(dnsdomainname)` with an external address suitable for contacting the cluster.\n+\n+### Optionally access the WebLogic console\n+\n+You can add an ingress rule to access the WebLogic Console from your local browser\n+\n+1. Find out the service name of the admin server and service port number.\n+\n+The name follows the pattern <Domain UID>-<admin server name> all lower case and the port number will be described in your \n+WDT model's admin server `listenPort`.\n+\n+You can also find the information by:\n+\n+```\n+kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns get services\n+```\n+\n+```\n+NAME                               TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE\n+sample-domain1-admin-server        ClusterIP   None           <none>        7001/TCP   48m\n+```\n+\n+This shows the admin service name is `sample-domain1-admin-server` and the port for the console is `7001`\n+\n+2. Create an ingress rule for the WebLogic console\n+\n+Create the following file and call it `console-ingress.yaml` in your `$WORKDIR`.\n+\n+```\n+apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\n+kind: Ingress\n+metadata:\n+  name: sample-domain1-console-ingress\n+  namespace: sample-domain1-ns\n+  annotations:\n+    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: traefik\n+spec:\n+  rules:\n+  - host:\n+    http:\n+      paths:\n+      - path: /console\n+        backend:\n+          serviceName: sample-domain1-admin-server\n+          servicePort: 7001\n+\n+```\n+\n+This will route the request path `/console` to the admin service port `7001` at pod `sample-domain1-admin-server` in the `sample-domain1-ns` namespace.\n+\n+3.  Apply the ingress rule resource\n+\n+```\n+kubectl apply -f $WORKDIR/console-ingress.yaml\n+```\n+\n+4.

Similarly, `RestrictedJRF` domains may be used by Oracle layered products such as Oracle Communications products.\n+\n+### References\n+\n+To reference the relevant user documentation, see:\n+ - [Model in Image User Guide]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) user documentation\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Server Deploy Tooling](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling)\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool)\n+\n+\n+\n+### Prerequisites for all domain types\n+\n+1. The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable must be set and must reference a valid JDK 8 installation. (`JAVA_HOME` is used by the WebLogic Image Tool.)\n+\n+2. Set a source directory environment variable `SRCDIR` that references the parent of the operator source tree. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   mkdir ~/wlopsrc\n+   cd ~/wlopsrc\n+   git clone https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator.git\n+   export SRCDIR=$(pwd)/weblogic-kubernetes-operator\n+   ```\n+\n+   For additional information about obtaining the operator source, see the [Developer Guide Requirements](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/developerguide/requirements/).\n+\n+3. Create a sample directory environment variable `SAMPLEDIR` that references this sample's directory:\n+\n+   ```\n+   export SAMPLEDIR=${SRCDIR}/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image/\n+   ```\n+\n+4. Create an empty, temporary working directory with 10g of space, and store its location in the `WORKDIR` environment variable. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd <location of empty temporary directory with 10g of space>\n+   export WORKDIR=$(pwd)\n+   ```\n+\n+5. Deploy the operator and set up the operator to manage the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`. Optionally, deploy a Traefik load balancer that manages the same namespace. For example, follow the same steps as the [Quick Start](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/quickstart/), up through the [Prepare for a domain]({{< relref \"/quickstart/prepare.md\" >}}) step.\n+\n+   Note that:\n+   - Deploying the Traefik load balancer is optional, but is a prerequisite for testing the web application that's deployed to WebLogic as part of this sample.\n+   - You can skip the Quick Start steps for obtaining a WebLogic image because you will be creating your own Docker image.\n+\n+\n+6. Choose the type of domain you're going to create: `WLS`, `JRF`, or `RestrictedJRF`, and set the environment variable, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, accordingly. The default is `WLS`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   export WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE=<one of WLS, JRF, or RestrictedJRF>\n+   ```\n+\n+7. Set up access to a base image for this sample that will be used as the base image for creating the final image. Do one of the following:\n+\n+   - __Option 1, download an existing WebLogic image.__\n+\n+     Set up access to this sample's base WebLogic image at the [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com):\n+\n+     a. Use a browser to access [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com).\n+\n+     b. Choose an image location:\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF` domains, select `Middleware`, then `fmw-infrastructure`.\n+       - For `WLS` domains, select `Middleware`, then `weblogic`.\n+\n+     c. Select Sign In and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+     d. Use your terminal to locally log in to Docker: `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+\n+     e. Later, when you run the sample, it will call `docker pull` for your base image based on the domain type.\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4`.\n+       - For `WLS`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4`.\n+\n+   - __Option 2, create your own WebLogic base image.__\n+\n+     Alternatively, you can create your own base image and override the sample's default base image name and tag by exporting the `BASE_IMAGE_NAME` and `BASE_IMAGE_TAG` environment variables prior to running the sample scripts. If you want to create your own base image, see [Preparing a Base Image]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-in-image/base-images/_index.md\" >}}).\n+\n+8. If you are using a `JRF` domain type, then it requires an RCU infrastructure database. See [Prerequisites for JRF Domains](#prerequisites-for-jrf-domains). You can do this step before or after you create your final image. If you're not using a `JRF` domain type, proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image).\n+\n+### Prerequisites for JRF domains\n+\n+> __NOTE__: This section is only required for demonstrating a `JRF` domain type. Skip this section and proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image) if your domain type is `WLS` or `RestrictedJRF`.\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database called an RCU database, requires initializing this database, and requires configuring your domain to access this database. All of these steps must occur before you first deploy your domain.\n+\n+Furthermore, if you want to have a restarted JRF domain access updates to the infrastructure database that the domain made at an earlier time, the restarted domain must be supplied a wallet file that was obtained from a previous run of the domain.\n+\n+The following steps demonstrate how to set up an infrastructure database that will work with this sample:\n+\n+  1. [Set up and initialize an RCU database](#set-up-and-initialize-an-rcu-database).\n+  2. [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout).\n+  3. [Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets](#set-up-rcu-model-attributes-domain-resource-attributes-and-secrets).\n+  4. [Reusing or sharing RCU tables](#reusing-or-sharing-rcu-tables).\n+\n+\n+\n+##### Set up and initialize an RCU database\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database and also requires initializing this database with a schema and a set of tables. The following example shows how to set up a sample RCU database and use the RCU tool to create the infrastructure schema for a JRF domain. The RCU database is set up with the following attributes:\n+\n+| Attribute | Value |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| database Kubernetes namespace | `default` |\n+| database Kubernetes pod | `oracle-db` |\n+| database image | `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` |\n+| database password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| infrastructure schema prefix | `FMW1` |\n+| infrastructure schema password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| database URL | `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s` |\n+\n+\n+1. Ensure you have access to the database image, and then deploy it:\n+\n+   - Use a browser to log in to `https://container-registry.oracle.com`, select `database->enterprise` and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+   - Get the database image:\n+     - In the local shell, `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+     - In the local shell, `docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim`.\n+\n+\n+       {{% notice note %}} If a local Docker login and manual pull of `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` is not sufficient (for example, if you are using a remote Kubernetes cluster), then uncomment the `imagePullSecrets` stanza in `$WORKDIR/k8s-db-slim.yaml` and create the image pull secret as follows:\n+\n+              ```\n+              kubectl create secret docker-registry regsecret \\\n+                --docker-server=container-registry.oracle.com \\\n+                --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+                --docker-password=your-password \\\n+                --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+              ```\n+       {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+\n+   - Use the sample script in `$SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service` to create an Oracle database running in the pod, `oracle-db`.\n+\n+      **NOTE**: If your database image access requires the `regsecret` image pull secret that you optionally created above, then pass `-s regsecret` to the `start-db-service.sh` command line.\n+\n+     ```\n+     cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service\n+     start-db-service.sh\n+     ```\n+\n+     This script will deploy a database with the URL, `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`, and administration password, `Oradoc_db1`.\n+\n+     {{% notice warning %}} The Oracle database Docker images are supported only for non-production use. For more details, see My Oracle Support note: Oracle Support for Database Running on Docker (Doc ID 2216342.1) : All the data is gone when the database is restarted.\n+     {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+     **NOTE**: This step is based on the steps documented in [Run a Database](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/userguide/overview/database/).\n+\n+2. Use the sample script in `SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema` to create the RCU schema with the schema prefix `FMW1`.\n+\n+   Note that this script assumes `Oradoc_db1` is the DBA password, `Oradoc_db1` is the schema password, and that the database URL is `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema\n+   ./create-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1 -i container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4\n+   ```\n+\n+   __NOTE__:  If you need to drop the repository, use this command:\n+\n+   ```\n+   drop-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1\n+   ```\n+\n+\n+##### Increase introspection job timeout\n+\n+Because JRF domain home creation takes a considerable amount of time the first time it is created, and because Model in Image creates your domain home for you using the introspection job, you should increase the timeout for the introspection job. Use the `configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds` in `k8s-domain.yaml.template` to override the default with a value of at least 300 seconds (the default is 120 seconds).  \n+\n+##### Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets\n+\n+To allow Model in Image to access the RCU database and OPSS wallet, it's necessary to set up an RCU access secret and an OPSS secret before deploying your domain. It's also necessary to define an `RCUDbInfo` stanza in your model. The sample already sets up all of these for you.  See:\n+\n+| Sample file | Description |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, with `password=welcome1`. |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, with appropriate values for attributes `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string`. |\n+| `model1.yaml.jrf` | Populates the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string` attributes by referencing their locations in the `sample-domain1-rcu-access` secret. The `build.sh` script uses this model instead of `model.yaml.wls` when the source domain type is `JRF`. |\n+| `k8s-domain.yaml.template` | Ensures that the domain mounts the OPSS key secret by setting the domain resource `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` attribute to `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, and ensures the domain mounts the RCU access secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, for reference by WDT model macros by setting the domain resource `configuration.secrets` attribute. Use configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds to increase the timeout value of the introspector job; see [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout). |\n+\n+ **NOTE**: This step is for information purposes only. Do not run the above sample files directly. The sample's main build and run scripts will run them for you.\n+\n+##### Reusing or sharing RCU tables\n+\n+Note that when you succesfully deploy your JRF domain resource for the first time, the introspector job will initialize the RCU tables for the domain using the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza in the WDT model plus the `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` specified in the domain resource. The job will also create a new domain home. Finally, the operator will also capture an OPSS wallet file from the new domain's local directory and place this file in a new Kubernetes config map.\n+\n+There are scenarios when the domain needs to be re-created between updates such as WebLogic credentials are changed, security roles defined in the WDT model have been changed or you want to share the same RCU tables with different domains.  Under these scenarios, the operator needs the `walletPasswordSecret` as well as the OPSS wallet file, together with the exact information in `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` so that the domain can be re-created and access the same set of RCU tables.  Without the wallet file and wallet password, you will not be able to re-create a domain accessing the same set of RCU tables, therefore it is highly recommended to backup the wallet file.\n+\n+To recover a domain's RCU tables between domain restarts or to share an RCU schema between different domains, it is necessary to extract this wallet file from the config map and save the OPSS wallet password secret that was used for the original domain. The wallet password and wallet file are needed again when you recreate the domain or share the database with other domains.\n+\n+To save the wallet file:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -s [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>]\n+```\n+\n+You should back up this file to a safe location that can be retrieved later.\n+\n+To reuse the wallet for subsequent redeployments or share the RCU tables between different domains:\n+\n+1. Store the wallet in a secret:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -r [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>] [-ws <name of the secret. Default DOMAIN_UID-opss-walletfile-secret> ]\n+\n+```\n+\n+2. Modify the domain resource YAML file to provide the secret names:\n+\n+```\n+  configuration:\n+    opss:\n+      # Name of secret with walletPassword for extracting the wallet\n+      walletPasswordSecret: sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret      \n+      # Name of secret with walletFile containing base64 encoded opss wallet\n+      walletFileSecret: sample-domain1-opss-walletfile-secret\n+\n+```\n+\n+See [Reusing an RCU database]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/reusing-rcu.md\" >}}) for instructions.\n+\n+### Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image\n+\n+Model in Image must contain a WebLogic install, a WebLogic Deploy Tool install, and your WDT model files. You can use the sample `./build.sh` script to build this image, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Uses `docker pull` to obtain a base image. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types) to set up access to the base image.)\n+  - Downloads the latest WebLogic Image Tool and WebLogic Deploy Tool to `WORKDIR`.\n+  - Creates and populates a staging directory `$WORKDIR/models` that contains your WDT model files and WDT application archive.\n+    - Builds  a simple servlet application in `$SAMPLEDIR/sample_app` into a WDT model application archive `$WORKDIR/models/archive1.zip`.\n+    - Copies sample model files from `$SAMPLEDIR/model-in-image` to `$WORKDIR/models`. This uses a model file that is appropriate to the domain type (for example, the `JRF` domain model includes database access configuration).\n+  - Uses the WebLogic Image Tool and the `$WORKDIR/models` staging directory to create a final image named `model-in-image:v1` that layers on the base image. Specifically, it runs the WebLogic Image Tool with its `update` option, which:\n+    - Builds the final image as a layer on the base image.\n+    - Puts a WDT install in image location, `/u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy`.\n+    - Copies the WDT model, properties, and application archive from `$WORDKIR/models` to image location, `/u01/wdt/models`.\n+\n+The script expects `JAVA_HOME`, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).)\n+\n+Run the script:\n+\n+  ```\n+  $SAMPLEDIR/build.sh\n+  ```\n+\n+If you intend to use a remote Docker registry, you need to tag and push the image to the remote Docker registry.\n+\n+1.  Tag the image for the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker tag <image-name>:<tag> <region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>:<tag>\n+```\n+\n+2.  Push the image to the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker push <region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>:<tag>\n+```\n+\n+3. Create the pull secret for the remote Docker registry:\n+\n+```\n+ kubectl -n <domain namespace> create secret docker-registry <secret name> \\\n+     --docker-server=<region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name> \\\n+     --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+     --docker-password=your-password \\\n+     --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+\n+```\n+\n+4. Update the domain template file `$SAMPLEDIR/k8s-domain.yaml.template` to provide the `imagePullSecrets`:\n+\n+```\n+  imagePullSecrets:\n+  - name: <secret name>\n+\n+```\n+\n+5. Export the environment variables for the image name and tag using the same values in step 1:\n+\n+```\n+export MODEL_IMAGE_NAME=\"<region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>\"\n+export MODEL_IMAGE_TAG=\"<tag>\"\n+```\n+\n+### Create and deploy your Kubernetes resources\n+\n+To deploy the sample operator domain and its required Kubernetes resources, use the sample script, `$SAMPLEDIR/run_domain.sh`, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Deletes the domain with a `DomainUID` of `domain1` in the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`, if it already exists.\n+  - Creates a secret containing your WebLogic administrator user name and password.\n+  - Creates a secret containing your Model in Image runtime encryption password:\n+    - All model-in-image domains must supply a runtime encryption secret with a `password` value.\n+    - It is used to encrypt configuration that is passed around internally by the Operator.\n+    - The value must be kept private but can be arbitrary: you can optionally supply a different secret value every time you restart the domain.\n+  - Creates secrets containing your RCU access URL, credentials, and prefix (these are unused unless the domain type is `JRF`).\n+  - Creates a config map containing an additional WDT model properties file, `$SAMPLEDIR/model1.20.properties`.\n+  - Generates a domain resource YAML file, `$WORKDIR/k8s-domain.yaml`, using `$SAMPLEDIR/k8s-domain.yaml.template`.\n+  - Deploys `k8s-domain.yaml`.\n+  - Displays the status of the domain pods.\n+\n+The script expects `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE` and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).)\n+\n+Run the script:\n+\n+  ```\n+  $SAMPLEDIR/run_domain.sh\n+  ```\n+\n+At the end, you will see the message `Getting pod status - ctrl-c when all is running and ready to exit`. Then you should see a WebLogic Administration Server and two Managed Server pods start. After all the pods are up, you can use `ctrl-c` to exit the build script.\n+\n+\n+### Optionally test the sample application\n+\n+1. Ensure Traefik has been installed and is servicing external port 30305, as per [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).\n+\n+2. Create a Kubernetes Ingress for the domain's WebLogic cluster in the domain's namespace by using the sample Helm chart:\n+\n+   For Helm 2.x:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd $SRCDIR\n+   $ helm install kubernetes/samples/charts/ingress-per-domain \\\n+     --name sample-domain1-ingress \\\n+     --namespace sample-domain1-ns \\\n+     --set wlsDomain.domainUID=sample-domain1 \\\n+     --set traefik.hostname=sample-domain1.org\n+   ```\n+\n+   For Helm 3.x:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd $SRCDIR\n+   helm install sample-domain1-ingress kubernetes/samples/charts/ingress-per-domain \\\n+    --namespace sample-domain1-ns \\\n+    --set wlsDomain.domainUID=sample-domain1 \\\n+    --set traefik.hostname=sample-domain1.org\n+   ```\n+\n+   This creates an Kubernetes Ingress that helps route HTTP traffic from the Traefik load balancer's external port 30305 to the WebLogic domain's `cluster-1` 8001 port. Note that the WDT config map in this sample changes the cluster's port from 9001 to 8001 (9001 is the original port configured using the WDT model defined within in the image).\n+\n+3. Send a web application request to the load balancer:\n+\n+   ```\n+   curl -H 'host: sample-domain1.org' http://$(hostname).$(dnsdomainname):30305/sample_war/index.jsp\n+   ```\n+\n+   You should see something like the following:\n+\n+   ```\n+   Hello World, you have reached server managed-server1\n+   ```\n+\n+   **Note**: If you're running on a remote Kubernetes cluster, then substitute `$(hostname).$(dnsdomainname)` with an external address suitable for contacting the cluster.\n+\n+4. Send a ReadyApp request to the load balancer (ReadyApp is a built-in WebLogic Server application):\n+\n+   ```\n+   curl -v -H 'host: sample-domain1.org' http://$(hostname).$(dnsdomainname):30305/weblogic/ready\n+   ```\n+\n+   You should see something like the following:\n+\n+\n+   ```\n+   * About to connect() to myhost.my.dns.domain.name port 30305 (#0)\n+   *   Trying 100.111.142.32...\n+   * Connected to myhost.my.dns.domain.name (100.111.142.32) port 30305 (#0)\n+   > GET /weblogic/ready HTTP/1.1\n+   > User-Agent: curl/7.29.0\n+   > Accept: */*\n+   > host: sample-domain1.org\n+   >\n+   < HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n+   < Content-Length: 0\n+   < Date: Mon, 09 Mar 2020 20:40:37 GMT\n+   < Vary: Accept-Encoding\n+   <\n+   * Connection #0 to host myhost.my.dns.domain.name left intact\n+   ```\n+\n+   **Note**: If you're running on a remote Kubernetes cluster, then substitute `$(hostname).$(dnsdomainname)` with an external address suitable for contacting the cluster.\n+\n+### Optionally access the WebLogic console\n+\n+You can add an ingress rule to access the WebLogic Console from your local browser\n+\n+1. Find out the service name of the admin server and service port number.\n+\n+The name follows the pattern <Domain UID>-<admin server name> all lower case and the port number will be described in your \n+WDT model's admin server `listenPort`.\n+\n+You can also find the information by:\n+\n+```\n+kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns get services\n+```\n+\n+```\n+NAME                               TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE\n+sample-domain1-admin-server        ClusterIP   None           <none>        7001/TCP   48m\n+```\n+\n+This shows the admin service name is `sample-domain1-admin-server` and the port for the console is `7001`\n+\n+2. Create an ingress rule for the WebLogic console\n+\n+Create the following file and call it `console-ingress.yaml` in your `$WORKDIR`.\n+\n+```\n+apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\n+kind: Ingress\n+metadata:\n+  name: sample-domain1-console-ingress\n+  namespace: sample-domain1-ns\n+  annotations:\n+    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: traefik\n+spec:\n+  rules:\n+  - host:\n+    http:\n+      paths:\n+      - path: /console\n+        backend:\n+          serviceName: sample-domain1-admin-server\n+          servicePort: 7001\n+\n+```\n+\n+This will route the request path `/console` to the admin service port `7001` at pod `sample-domain1-admin-server` in the `sample-domain1-ns` namespace.\n+\n+3.

If you need to make these kinds of updates, consider shutting down your domain entirely before making the change:\n+   - Adding, removing, or altering the network configuration of an existing Managed Server. This includes, but isn't limited to network channels, ports, and cluster addresses.\n+   - Adding a Managed Server to an existing configured cluster.\n+   - Altering the `cluster-size` or `max-cluster-size` of an existing dynamic cluster.\n+   - TBD This needs some research. Check with QA, etc.\n+\n+#### Changing a domain resource 'restartVersion'\n+\n+As was mentioned in the [overview](#overview), one way to tell the operator to apply your configuration changes to a running domain is by altering the domain resource `restartVersion`. Here are some common ways to do this:\n+\n+ - You can alter `restartVersion` interactively using `kubectl edit -n MY_NAMESPACE domain MY_DOMAINUID`.\n+\n+ - If you have your domain's resource file, then you can alter this file and call `kubectl apply -f` on the file.\n+\n+ - You can use the Kubernetes `get` and `patch` commands. Here's a sample automation script:\n+\n+   ```\n+   #!/bin/bash\n+   NAMESPACE=${1:-sample-domain1-ns}\n+   DOMAINUID=${2:-sample-domain1}\n+   currentRV=$(kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} get domain ${DOMAINUID} -o=jsonpath='{.spec.restartVersion}')\n+   if [ $? = 0 ]; then\n+     # we enter here only if the previous command succeeded\n+\n+     nextRV=$((currentRV + 1))\n+\n+     echo \"@@ Info: Rolling domain '${DOMAINUID}' in namespace '${NAMESPACE}' from restartVersion='${currentRV}' to restartVersion='${nextRV}'.\"\n+\n+     kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} patch domain ${DOMAINUID} --type='json' \\\n+       -p='[{\"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/spec/restartVersion\", \"value\": \"'${nextRV}'\" }]'\n+   fi\n+   ```\n+\n+#### Using the WDT Discover Domain Tool\n+\n+The WebLogic Deploy Tooling [Discover Domain Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling/blob/master/site/discover.md) generates model files from an existing domain home. You can use this tool to help determine the model file contents you would need to supply to update an existing model.\n+\n+For example, if you already have a running Model in Image domain in `sample-domain1-ns` with an Administration Server pod, `sample-domain1-admin-server`, you can do the following:\n+\n+  ```\n+  # (1) get a bash prompt in your admin server pod\n+  kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns \\\n+    exec -it sample-domain1-admin-server /bin/bash\n+\n+  # (2) In the pod, use the image's WDT discover script to\n+  # get the original WDT configuration. Notes:\n+  #  - WebLogic pods define ORACLE_HOME and DOMAIN_HOME\n+  #    for you.\n+  #  - A Model in Image image will already have WDT binaries\n+  #    in '/u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy/bin'.\n+  #  - Set 'domain_type' to one of WLS, JRF, or\n+  #    RestrictedJRF.\n+\n+  /u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy/bin/discoverDomain.sh \\\n+    -oracle_home $ORACLE_HOME \\\n+    -domain_home $DOMAIN_HOME \\\n+    -domain_type WLS \\\n+    -archive_file old.zip \\\n+    -model_file old.yaml \\\n+    -variable_file old.properties\n+\n+  # (3) Now make some WebLogic config changes via the console or WLST.\n+\n+  # (4) In the pod, use the image's WDT discover script to\n+  # get the latest WDT configuration after your changes.

This example is designed to work on top of the [Model in Image]({{< relref \"/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) sample.\n+\n+This example references a database running in the `default` namespace that is accessed with the URL `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`, user `sys as dba`, and password `Oradoc_db1`. Note that you can still add this data source even if there's no database running at this location.\n+\n+{{% notice note %}} If you already have a WDT config map deployed for your running domain, as is true for the [Model in Image]({{< relref \"/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) sample, then you should ensure that it includes any other needed files that were in the original WDT config map, in addition to the new data source YAML file. For example, the Model in Image sample puts file(s) in a directory that it uses to stage its config map in `$WORKDIR/wdtconfigmap`.\n+{{% /notice %}}\n+\n+\n+  ```\n+  #!/bin/bash\n+\n+  set -eu\n+\n+  # Assume SAMPLEDIR references the 'kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image' directory within the operator source.\n+\n+  # Assume the DB is running in the following namespace\n+\n+  DB_NAMESPACE=\"default\"\n+\n+  # Assume DOMAIN_UID is the following\n+\n+  DOMAIN_UID=sample-domain1\n+\n+  # Assume DOMAIN_NAMESPACE is the following\n+\n+  DOMAIN_NAMESPACE=sample-domain1-ns\n+\n+  # Assume the DB URL and password are defined in a secret as follows\n+\n+  $SAMPLEDIR/create_secret.sh \\\n+    -n ${DOMAIN_NAMESPACE} \\\n+    -s ${DOMAIN_UID}-new-db-access-secret \\\n+    -l password=Oradoc_db1 \\\n+    -l url=oracle-db.${DB_NAMESPACE}.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s\n+\n+  # Assume WORKDIR is your working directory\n+\n+  cd $WORKDIR\n+\n+  # Create a WDT configmap with the datasource WDT yaml snippet\n+\n+  mkdir -p ./wdtconfigmap\n+\n+  cat << EOF > wdtconfigmap/datasource.yaml\n+  resources:\n+    JDBCSystemResource:\n+      mynewdatasource:\n+        Target: 'cluster-1'\n+        JdbcResource:\n+          JDBCDataSourceParams:\n+            JNDIName: [\n+              jdbc/generic2,\n+              jdbc/special2\n+            ]\n+            GlobalTransactionsProtocol: TwoPhaseCommit\n+          JDBCDriverParams:\n+            DriverName: oracle.jdbc.xa.client.OracleXADataSource\n+            URL:               '@@SECRET:@@ENV:DOMAIN_UID@@-new-db-access-secret/url@@'\n+            PasswordEncrypted: '@@SECRET:@@ENV:DOMAIN_UID@@-new-db-access-secret/password@@'\n+            Properties:\n+              user:\n+                Value: 'sys as sysdba'\n+              oracle.net.CONNECT_TIMEOUT:\n+                Value: 5000\n+              oracle.jdbc.ReadTimeout:\n+                Value: 30000\n+          JDBCConnectionPoolParams:\n+              InitialCapacity: 0\n+              MaxCapacity: 1                   # This is a comment", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "3f46823be21e32c4b54a101d5590aeb40dbcdb15"}, "originalPosition": 247}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5NjcxMjUxMg==", "bodyText": "Assuming you're serious:  it's to teach folks how one can put comments in a model file.", "url": "https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/pull/1478#discussion_r396712512", "createdAt": "2020-03-23T19:43:53Z", "author": {"login": "tbarnes-us"}, "path": "docs-source/content/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/runtime-updates.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,325 @@\n++++\n+title = \"Runtime updates\"\n+date = 2020-03-11T16:45:16-05:00\n+weight = 50\n+pre = \"<b> </b>\"\n+description = \"Updating a running Model in Image domain's images and model files.\"\n++++\n+\n+#### Contents\n+\n+ - [Overview](#overview)\n+ - [Important notes](#important-notes)\n+ - [Frequently asked questions](#frequently-asked-questions)\n+ - [Supported and unsupported updates](#supported-and-unsupported-updates)\n+ - [Changing a domain resource 'restartVersion'](#changing-a-domain-resource-restartversion)\n+ - [Using the WDT Discover Domain Tool](#using-the-wdt-discover-domain-tool)\n+ - [Example of adding a data source](#example-of-adding-a-data-source)\n+\n+#### Overview\n+\n+If you want to make a WebLogic domain home configuration change to a running Model in Image domain, and you want the change to survive WebLogic pod restarts, then you can modify your existing model by one or more the following approaches:\n+\n+  - Changing secrets or environment variables that are referenced by macros in your model files.\n+\n+  - Specifying a new or updated WDT config map that contains model files and use your domain resource `configuration.model.configMap` field to reference the map.\n+\n+  - Supplying a new image with new and/or changed model files.\n+\n+After changes are in place, you can tell the operator to load the changes and propagate them to a running domain by altering the domain resource's `image` or `restartVersion` attribute.\n+\n+#### Important notes\n+\n+ - Check for [Supported and unsupported updates](#supported-and-unsupported-updates).\n+\n+ - If you specify multiple model files in your image or WDT config map, the order in which they're loaded and merged is determined as described in [Model file naming and loading order]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md#model-file-naming-and-loading-order\" >}}).\n+\n+ - You can use the WDT Discover Domain Tool to help generate your model file updates. See [Using the WDT Discover Domain Tool](#using-the-wdt-discover-tool).\n+\n+ - For simple ways to change `restartVersion`, see [Changing a domain resource 'restartVersion'](#changing-a-domain-resource-restartversion).\n+\n+ - For a sample of adding a data source to a running domain, see [Example of adding a data source](#example-of-adding-a-data-source).\n+\n+ - For a discussion of model file syntax, see the [WebLogic Deploy Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling) documentation and [Model files]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md\" >}}).\n+\n+ - If the introspector job reports a failure, see [Debugging]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/debugging.md\" >}}) for debugging advice.\n+\n+#### Frequently asked questions\n+\n+_Why is it necessary to specify updates using model files?_\n+\n+Similar to Domain in Image, if you make a direct runtime WebLogic configuration update of a Model in Image domain using the WebLogic console or WLST scripts, then the update is ephemeral. This is because the domain home is stored in an image directory which will not survive the restart of the owning pod.\n+\n+_How do Model in Image updates work during runtime?_\n+\n+After you make a change to your domain resource `restartVersion` or `image` attribute, the operator will rerun the domain's introspector job. This job will reload all of your secrets and environment variables, merge all of your model files, and generate a new domain home. If the job succeeds, then the operator will make the updated domain home available to pods using a config map named `DOMAIN_UID-weblogic-domain-introspect-cm`. Finally, the operator will subsequently roll (restart) each running WebLogic Server pod in the domain so that it can load the new configuration. A domain roll begins by restarting the domain's Administration Server and then proceeds to restart each Manager Server in the domain.\n+\n+_Can we use custom configuration overrides to do the updates instead?_\n+\n+No. Custom configuration overrides, which are WebLogic configuration overrides specified using a domain resource `configuration.overridesConfigMap`, as described in [Configuration overrides]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/configoverrides/_index.md\" >}}), aren't supported in combination with Model in Image. Model in Image will generate an error if custom overrides are specified. This should not be a concern because model file, secret, and/or model image updates are simpler and more flexible than custom configuration override updates. Unlike configuration overrides, the syntax for a model file update exactly matches the syntax for specifying your model file in the first place.\n+\n+\n+#### Supported and unsupported updates\n+\n+ - You can add new MBeans or resources simply by specifying their corresponding model file YAML snippet along with their parent bean hierarchy. See [Example of adding a data source](#example-of-adding-a-datasource).\n+\n+ - You can recreate, change, or add secrets that your model depends on. For example, you can change a database password secret.\n+\n+ - You can change or add environment variables that your model macros may depend on (macros that use the `@@ENV:myenvvar@@` syntax).\n+\n+ - You can remove a named MBean or resource by specifying a model file with a `!` symbol just before the bean or resource name. For example, if you have a data source named `mynewdatasource` defined in your model, it can be removed by specifying a small model file that loads after the model file that defines the data source, where the small model file looks like this:\n+\n+  ```\n+  resources:\n+    JDBCSystemResource:\n+      !mynewdatasource:\n+  ```\n+\n+  For more information, see [Declaring Named MBeans to Delete](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling#declaring-named-mbeans-to-delete) in the WebLogic Deploying Tooling documentation.\n+\n+ - You can add or alter an MBean attribute by specifying a YAML snippet along with its parent bean hierarchy that references an existing MBean and the attribute. For example, to add or alter the max capacity of a data source named `mynewdatasource`:\n+\n+  ```\n+  resources:\n+    JDBCSystemResource:\n+      mynewdatasource:\n+        JdbcResource:\n+          JDBCConnectionPoolParams:\n+            MaxCapacity: 5\n+  ```\n+\n+  For more information, see [Using Multiple Models](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling#using-multiple-models) in the WebLogic Deploy Tooling documentation.\n+\n+ - There is no way to directly delete an attribute from an MBean that's already been specified by a model file. The work-around is to do this using two model files: (a) add a model file that deletes the named bean/resource that is a parent to the attribute you want to delete, and (b) add another  subsequent model file that fully defines the named bean/resource but without the attribute you want to delete.\n+\n+ - The following runtime updates haven't been tested and are _not_ supported in the first release of Model in Image. If you need to make these kinds of updates, consider shutting down your domain entirely before making the change:\n+   - Adding, removing, or altering the network configuration of an existing Managed Server. This includes, but isn't limited to network channels, ports, and cluster addresses.\n+   - Adding a Managed Server to an existing configured cluster.\n+   - Altering the `cluster-size` or `max-cluster-size` of an existing dynamic cluster.\n+   - TBD This needs some research. Check with QA, etc.\n+\n+#### Changing a domain resource 'restartVersion'\n+\n+As was mentioned in the [overview](#overview), one way to tell the operator to apply your configuration changes to a running domain is by altering the domain resource `restartVersion`. Here are some common ways to do this:\n+\n+ - You can alter `restartVersion` interactively using `kubectl edit -n MY_NAMESPACE domain MY_DOMAINUID`.\n+\n+ - If you have your domain's resource file, then you can alter this file and call `kubectl apply -f` on the file.\n+\n+ - You can use the Kubernetes `get` and `patch` commands. Here's a sample automation script:\n+\n+   ```\n+   #!/bin/bash\n+   NAMESPACE=${1:-sample-domain1-ns}\n+   DOMAINUID=${2:-sample-domain1}\n+   currentRV=$(kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} get domain ${DOMAINUID} -o=jsonpath='{.spec.restartVersion}')\n+   if [ $? = 0 ]; then\n+     # we enter here only if the previous command succeeded\n+\n+     nextRV=$((currentRV + 1))\n+\n+     echo \"@@ Info: Rolling domain '${DOMAINUID}' in namespace '${NAMESPACE}' from restartVersion='${currentRV}' to restartVersion='${nextRV}'.\"\n+\n+     kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} patch domain ${DOMAINUID} --type='json' \\\n+       -p='[{\"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/spec/restartVersion\", \"value\": \"'${nextRV}'\" }]'\n+   fi\n+   ```\n+\n+#### Using the WDT Discover Domain Tool\n+\n+The WebLogic Deploy Tooling [Discover Domain Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling/blob/master/site/discover.md) generates model files from an existing domain home. You can use this tool to help determine the model file contents you would need to supply to update an existing model.\n+\n+For example, if you already have a running Model in Image domain in `sample-domain1-ns` with an Administration Server pod, `sample-domain1-admin-server`, you can do the following:\n+\n+  ```\n+  # (1) get a bash prompt in your admin server pod\n+  kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns \\\n+    exec -it sample-domain1-admin-server /bin/bash\n+\n+  # (2) In the pod, use the image's WDT discover script to\n+  # get the original WDT configuration.

This example is designed to work on top of the [Model in Image]({{< relref \"/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) sample.\n+\n+This example references a database running in the `default` namespace that is accessed with the URL `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`, user `sys as dba`, and password `Oradoc_db1`.

For example, to add or alter the max capacity of a data source named `mynewdatasource`:\n+\n+  ```\n+  resources:\n+    JDBCSystemResource:\n+      mynewdatasource:\n+        JdbcResource:\n+          JDBCConnectionPoolParams:\n+            MaxCapacity: 5\n+  ```\n+\n+  For more information, see [Using Multiple Models](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling#using-multiple-models) in the WebLogic Deploy Tooling documentation.\n+\n+ - There is no way to directly delete an attribute from an MBean that's already been specified by a model file. The work-around is to do this using two model files: (a) add a model file that deletes the named bean/resource that is a parent to the attribute you want to delete, and (b) add another  subsequent model file that fully defines the named bean/resource but without the attribute you want to delete.\n+\n+ - The following runtime updates haven't been tested and are _not_ supported in the first release of Model in Image. If you need to make these kinds of updates, consider shutting down your domain entirely before making the change:\n+   - Adding, removing, or altering the network configuration of an existing Managed Server. This includes, but isn't limited to network channels, ports, and cluster addresses.\n+   - Adding a Managed Server to an existing configured cluster.\n+   - Altering the `cluster-size` or `max-cluster-size` of an existing dynamic cluster.\n+   - TBD This needs some research. Check with QA, etc.\n+\n+#### Changing a domain resource 'restartVersion'\n+\n+As was mentioned in the [overview](#overview), one way to tell the operator to apply your configuration changes to a running domain is by altering the domain resource `restartVersion`. Here are some common ways to do this:\n+\n+ - You can alter `restartVersion` interactively using `kubectl edit -n MY_NAMESPACE domain MY_DOMAINUID`.\n+\n+ - If you have your domain's resource file, then you can alter this file and call `kubectl apply -f` on the file.\n+\n+ - You can use the Kubernetes `get` and `patch` commands. Here's a sample automation script:\n+\n+   ```\n+   #!/bin/bash\n+   NAMESPACE=${1:-sample-domain1-ns}\n+   DOMAINUID=${2:-sample-domain1}\n+   currentRV=$(kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} get domain ${DOMAINUID} -o=jsonpath='{.spec.restartVersion}')\n+   if [ $? = 0 ]; then\n+     # we enter here only if the previous command succeeded\n+\n+     nextRV=$((currentRV + 1))\n+\n+     echo \"@@ Info: Rolling domain '${DOMAINUID}' in namespace '${NAMESPACE}' from restartVersion='${currentRV}' to restartVersion='${nextRV}'.\"\n+\n+     kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} patch domain ${DOMAINUID} --type='json' \\\n+       -p='[{\"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/spec/restartVersion\", \"value\": \"'${nextRV}'\" }]'\n+   fi\n+   ```\n+\n+#### Using the WDT Discover Domain Tool\n+\n+The WebLogic Deploy Tooling [Discover Domain Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling/blob/master/site/discover.md) generates model files from an existing domain home. You can use this tool to help determine the model file contents you would need to supply to update an existing model.\n+\n+For example, if you already have a running Model in Image domain in `sample-domain1-ns` with an Administration Server pod, `sample-domain1-admin-server`, you can do the following:\n+\n+  ```\n+  # (1) get a bash prompt in your admin server pod\n+  kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns \\\n+    exec -it sample-domain1-admin-server /bin/bash\n+\n+  # (2) In the pod, use the image's WDT discover script to\n+  # get the original WDT configuration. Notes:\n+  #  - WebLogic pods define ORACLE_HOME and DOMAIN_HOME\n+  #    for you.\n+  #  - A Model in Image image will already have WDT binaries\n+  #    in '/u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy/bin'.\n+  #  - Set 'domain_type' to one of WLS, JRF, or\n+  #    RestrictedJRF.\n+\n+  /u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy/bin/discoverDomain.sh \\\n+    -oracle_home $ORACLE_HOME \\\n+    -domain_home $DOMAIN_HOME \\\n+    -domain_type WLS \\\n+    -archive_file old.zip \\\n+    -model_file old.yaml \\\n+    -variable_file old.properties\n+\n+  # (3) Now make some WebLogic config changes via the console or WLST.\n+\n+  # (4) In the pod, use the image's WDT discover script to\n+  # get the latest WDT configuration after your changes. Notes:\n+  #  - Set 'domain_type' to one of WLS, JRF, or\n+  #    RestrictedJRF.\n+\n+  /u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy/bin/discoverDomain.sh \\\n+    -oracle_home $ORACLE_HOME \\\n+    -domain_home $DOMAIN_HOME \\\n+    -domain_type WLS \\\n+    -archive_file new.zip \\\n+    -model_file new.yaml \\\n+    -variable_file new.properties\n+\n+  # (5) In the pod, compare your old and new yaml to see what\n+  # changed.\n+\n+  diff new.yaml old.yaml\n+  ```\n+\n+#### Example of adding a data source\n+\n+Here's an example script for adding a data source to a WebLogic cluster named `cluster-1` for a domain resource in namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`, with domain UID, `sample-domain1`. This example is designed to work on top of the [Model in Image]({{< relref \"/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) sample.\n+\n+This example references a database running in the `default` namespace that is accessed with the URL `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`, user `sys as dba`, and password `Oradoc_db1`. Note that you can still add this data source even if there's no database running at this location.\n+\n+{{% notice note %}} If you already have a WDT config map deployed for your running domain, as is true for the [Model in Image]({{< relref \"/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) sample, then you should ensure that it includes any other needed files that were in the original WDT config map, in addition to the new data source YAML file. For example, the Model in Image sample puts file(s) in a directory that it uses to stage its config map in `$WORKDIR/wdtconfigmap`.\n+{{% /notice %}}\n+\n+\n+  ```\n+  #!/bin/bash\n+\n+  set -eu\n+\n+  # Assume SAMPLEDIR references the 'kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image' directory within the operator source.\n+\n+  # Assume the DB is running in the following namespace\n+\n+  DB_NAMESPACE=\"default\"\n+\n+  # Assume DOMAIN_UID is the following\n+\n+  DOMAIN_UID=sample-domain1\n+\n+  # Assume DOMAIN_NAMESPACE is the following\n+\n+  DOMAIN_NAMESPACE=sample-domain1-ns\n+\n+  # Assume the DB URL and password are defined in a secret as follows\n+\n+  $SAMPLEDIR/create_secret.sh \\\n+    -n ${DOMAIN_NAMESPACE} \\\n+    -s ${DOMAIN_UID}-new-db-access-secret \\\n+    -l password=Oradoc_db1 \\\n+    -l url=oracle-db.${DB_NAMESPACE}.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s\n+\n+  # Assume WORKDIR is your working directory\n+\n+  cd $WORKDIR\n+\n+  # Create a WDT configmap with the datasource WDT yaml snippet\n+\n+  mkdir -p ./wdtconfigmap\n+\n+  cat << EOF > wdtconfigmap/datasource.yaml\n+  resources:\n+    JDBCSystemResource:\n+      mynewdatasource:\n+        Target: 'cluster-1'\n+        JdbcResource:\n+          JDBCDataSourceParams:\n+            JNDIName: [\n+              jdbc/generic2,\n+              jdbc/special2\n+            ]\n+            GlobalTransactionsProtocol: TwoPhaseCommit\n+          JDBCDriverParams:\n+            DriverName: oracle.jdbc.xa.client.OracleXADataSource\n+            URL:               '@@SECRET:@@ENV:DOMAIN_UID@@-new-db-access-secret/url@@'\n+            PasswordEncrypted: '@@SECRET:@@ENV:DOMAIN_UID@@-new-db-access-secret/password@@'\n+            Properties:\n+              user:\n+                Value: 'sys as sysdba'\n+              oracle.net.CONNECT_TIMEOUT:\n+                Value: 5000\n+              oracle.jdbc.ReadTimeout:\n+                Value: 30000\n+          JDBCConnectionPoolParams:\n+              InitialCapacity: 0\n+              MaxCapacity: 1                   # This is a comment", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5NjcwODUxNw=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "3f46823be21e32c4b54a101d5590aeb40dbcdb15"}, "originalPosition": 247}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5NjgwMzc4NA==", "bodyText": "Tom AI: Remove fancy macro-within-macro, to be more clear.

See [Using the WDT Discover Domain Tool](#using-the-wdt-discover-tool).\n+\n+ - For simple ways to change `restartVersion`, see [Changing a domain resource 'restartVersion'](#changing-a-domain-resource-restartversion).\n+\n+ - For a sample of adding a data source to a running domain, see [Example of adding a data source](#example-of-adding-a-data-source).\n+\n+ - For a discussion of model file syntax, see the [WebLogic Deploy Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling) documentation and [Model files]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md\" >}}).\n+\n+ - If the introspector job reports a failure, see [Debugging]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/debugging.md\" >}}) for debugging advice.\n+\n+#### Frequently asked questions\n+\n+_Why is it necessary to specify updates using model files?_\n+\n+Similar to Domain in Image, if you make a direct runtime WebLogic configuration update of a Model in Image domain using the WebLogic console or WLST scripts, then the update is ephemeral. This is because the domain home is stored in an image directory which will not survive the restart of the owning pod.\n+\n+_How do Model in Image updates work during runtime?_\n+\n+After you make a change to your domain resource `restartVersion` or `image` attribute, the operator will rerun the domain's introspector job. This job will reload all of your secrets and environment variables, merge all of your model files, and generate a new domain home. If the job succeeds, then the operator will make the updated domain home available to pods using a config map named `DOMAIN_UID-weblogic-domain-introspect-cm`. Finally, the operator will subsequently roll (restart) each running WebLogic Server pod in the domain so that it can load the new configuration. A domain roll begins by restarting the domain's Administration Server and then proceeds to restart each Manager Server in the domain.\n+\n+_Can we use custom configuration overrides to do the updates instead?_\n+\n+No. Custom configuration overrides, which are WebLogic configuration overrides specified using a domain resource `configuration.overridesConfigMap`, as described in [Configuration overrides]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/configoverrides/_index.md\" >}}), aren't supported in combination with Model in Image. Model in Image will generate an error if custom overrides are specified. This should not be a concern because model file, secret, and/or model image updates are simpler and more flexible than custom configuration override updates. Unlike configuration overrides, the syntax for a model file update exactly matches the syntax for specifying your model file in the first place.\n+\n+\n+#### Supported and unsupported updates\n+\n+ - You can add new MBeans or resources simply by specifying their corresponding model file YAML snippet along with their parent bean hierarchy. See [Example of adding a data source](#example-of-adding-a-datasource).\n+\n+ - You can recreate, change, or add secrets that your model depends on. For example, you can change a database password secret.\n+\n+ - You can change or add environment variables that your model macros may depend on (macros that use the `@@ENV:myenvvar@@` syntax).\n+\n+ - You can remove a named MBean or resource by specifying a model file with a `!` symbol just before the bean or resource name. For example, if you have a data source named `mynewdatasource` defined in your model, it can be removed by specifying a small model file that loads after the model file that defines the data source, where the small model file looks like this:\n+\n+  ```\n+  resources:\n+    JDBCSystemResource:\n+      !mynewdatasource:\n+  ```\n+\n+  For more information, see [Declaring Named MBeans to Delete](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling#declaring-named-mbeans-to-delete) in the WebLogic Deploying Tooling documentation.\n+\n+ - You can add or alter an MBean attribute by specifying a YAML snippet along with its parent bean hierarchy that references an existing MBean and the attribute. For example, to add or alter the max capacity of a data source named `mynewdatasource`:\n+\n+  ```\n+  resources:\n+    JDBCSystemResource:\n+      mynewdatasource:\n+        JdbcResource:\n+          JDBCConnectionPoolParams:\n+            MaxCapacity: 5\n+  ```\n+\n+  For more information, see [Using Multiple Models](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling#using-multiple-models) in the WebLogic Deploy Tooling documentation.\n+\n+ - There is no way to directly delete an attribute from an MBean that's already been specified by a model file.

See [Using the WDT Discover Domain Tool](#using-the-wdt-discover-tool).\n+\n+ - For simple ways to change `restartVersion`, see [Changing a domain resource 'restartVersion'](#changing-a-domain-resource-restartversion).\n+\n+ - For a sample of adding a data source to a running domain, see [Example of adding a data source](#example-of-adding-a-data-source).\n+\n+ - For a discussion of model file syntax, see the [WebLogic Deploy Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling) documentation and [Model files]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md\" >}}).\n+\n+ - If the introspector job reports a failure, see [Debugging]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/debugging.md\" >}}) for debugging advice.\n+\n+#### Frequently asked questions\n+\n+_Why is it necessary to specify updates using model files?_\n+\n+Similar to Domain in Image, if you make a direct runtime WebLogic configuration update of a Model in Image domain using the WebLogic console or WLST scripts, then the update is ephemeral. This is because the domain home is stored in an image directory which will not survive the restart of the owning pod.\n+\n+_How do Model in Image updates work during runtime?_\n+\n+After you make a change to your domain resource `restartVersion` or `image` attribute, the operator will rerun the domain's introspector job. This job will reload all of your secrets and environment variables, merge all of your model files, and generate a new domain home. If the job succeeds, then the operator will make the updated domain home available to pods using a config map named `DOMAIN_UID-weblogic-domain-introspect-cm`. Finally, the operator will subsequently roll (restart) each running WebLogic Server pod in the domain so that it can load the new configuration. A domain roll begins by restarting the domain's Administration Server and then proceeds to restart each Manager Server in the domain.\n+\n+_Can we use custom configuration overrides to do the updates instead?_\n+\n+No. Custom configuration overrides, which are WebLogic configuration overrides specified using a domain resource `configuration.overridesConfigMap`, as described in [Configuration overrides]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/configoverrides/_index.md\" >}}), aren't supported in combination with Model in Image. Model in Image will generate an error if custom overrides are specified. This should not be a concern because model file, secret, and/or model image updates are simpler and more flexible than custom configuration override updates. Unlike configuration overrides, the syntax for a model file update exactly matches the syntax for specifying your model file in the first place.\n+\n+\n+#### Supported and unsupported updates\n+\n+ - You can add new MBeans or resources simply by specifying their corresponding model file YAML snippet along with their parent bean hierarchy. See [Example of adding a data source](#example-of-adding-a-datasource).\n+\n+ - You can recreate, change, or add secrets that your model depends on. For example, you can change a database password secret.\n+\n+ - You can change or add environment variables that your model macros may depend on (macros that use the `@@ENV:myenvvar@@` syntax).\n+\n+ - You can remove a named MBean or resource by specifying a model file with a `!` symbol just before the bean or resource name. For example, if you have a data source named `mynewdatasource` defined in your model, it can be removed by specifying a small model file that loads after the model file that defines the data source, where the small model file looks like this:\n+\n+  ```\n+  resources:\n+    JDBCSystemResource:\n+      !mynewdatasource:\n+  ```\n+\n+  For more information, see [Declaring Named MBeans to Delete](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling#declaring-named-mbeans-to-delete) in the WebLogic Deploying Tooling documentation.\n+\n+ - You can add or alter an MBean attribute by specifying a YAML snippet along with its parent bean hierarchy that references an existing MBean and the attribute. For example, to add or alter the max capacity of a data source named `mynewdatasource`:\n+\n+  ```\n+  resources:\n+    JDBCSystemResource:\n+      mynewdatasource:\n+        JdbcResource:\n+          JDBCConnectionPoolParams:\n+            MaxCapacity: 5\n+  ```\n+\n+  For more information, see [Using Multiple Models](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling#using-multiple-models) in the WebLogic Deploy Tooling documentation.\n+\n+ - There is no way to directly delete an attribute from an MBean that's already been specified by a model file. The work-around is to do this using two model files: (a) add a model file that deletes the named bean/resource that is a parent to the attribute you want to delete, and (b) add another  subsequent model file that fully defines the named bean/resource but without the attribute you want to delete.\n+\n+ - The following runtime updates haven't been tested and are _not_ supported in the first release of Model in Image. If you need to make these kinds of updates, consider shutting down your domain entirely before making the change:\n+   - Adding, removing, or altering the network configuration of an existing Managed Server. This includes, but isn't limited to network channels, ports, and cluster addresses.\n+   - Adding a Managed Server to an existing configured cluster.\n+   - Altering the `cluster-size` or `max-cluster-size` of an existing dynamic cluster.\n+   - TBD This needs some research. Check with QA, etc.\n+\n+#### Changing a domain resource 'restartVersion'\n+\n+As was mentioned in the [overview](#overview), one way to tell the operator to apply your configuration changes to a running domain is by altering the domain resource `restartVersion`. Here are some common ways to do this:\n+\n+ - You can alter `restartVersion` interactively using `kubectl edit -n MY_NAMESPACE domain MY_DOMAINUID`.\n+\n+ - If you have your domain's resource file, then you can alter this file and call `kubectl apply -f` on the file.\n+\n+ - You can use the Kubernetes `get` and `patch` commands. Here's a sample automation script:\n+\n+   ```\n+   #!/bin/bash\n+   NAMESPACE=${1:-sample-domain1-ns}\n+   DOMAINUID=${2:-sample-domain1}\n+   currentRV=$(kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} get domain ${DOMAINUID} -o=jsonpath='{.spec.restartVersion}')\n+   if [ $? = 0 ]; then\n+     # we enter here only if the previous command succeeded\n+\n+     nextRV=$((currentRV + 1))\n+\n+     echo \"@@ Info: Rolling domain '${DOMAINUID}' in namespace '${NAMESPACE}' from restartVersion='${currentRV}' to restartVersion='${nextRV}'.\"\n+\n+     kubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} patch domain ${DOMAINUID} --type='json' \\\n+       -p='[{\"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/spec/restartVersion\", \"value\": \"'${nextRV}'\" }]'\n+   fi\n+   ```\n+\n+#### Using the WDT Discover Domain Tool\n+\n+The WebLogic Deploy Tooling [Discover Domain Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling/blob/master/site/discover.md) generates model files from an existing domain home. You can use this tool to help determine the model file contents you would need to supply to update an existing model.\n+\n+For example, if you already have a running Model in Image domain in `sample-domain1-ns` with an Administration Server pod, `sample-domain1-admin-server`, you can do the following:\n+\n+  ```\n+  # (1) get a bash prompt in your admin server pod\n+  kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns \\\n+    exec -it sample-domain1-admin-server /bin/bash\n+\n+  # (2) In the pod, use the image's WDT discover script to\n+  # get the original WDT configuration. Notes:\n+  #  - WebLogic pods define ORACLE_HOME and DOMAIN_HOME\n+  #    for you.\n+  #  - A Model in Image image will already have WDT binaries\n+  #    in '/u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy/bin'.\n+  #  - Set 'domain_type' to one of WLS, JRF, or\n+  #    RestrictedJRF.\n+\n+  /u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy/bin/discoverDomain.sh \\\n+    -oracle_home $ORACLE_HOME \\\n+    -domain_home $DOMAIN_HOME \\\n+    -domain_type WLS \\\n+    -archive_file old.zip \\\n+    -model_file old.yaml \\\n+    -variable_file old.properties\n+\n+  # (3) Now make some WebLogic config changes via the console or WLST.\n+\n+  # (4) In the pod, use the image's WDT discover script to\n+  # get the latest WDT configuration after your changes. Notes:\n+  #  - Set 'domain_type' to one of WLS, JRF, or\n+  #    RestrictedJRF.\n+\n+  /u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy/bin/discoverDomain.sh \\\n+    -oracle_home $ORACLE_HOME \\\n+    -domain_home $DOMAIN_HOME \\\n+    -domain_type WLS \\\n+    -archive_file new.zip \\\n+    -model_file new.yaml \\\n+    -variable_file new.properties\n+\n+  # (5) In the pod, compare your old and new yaml to see what\n+  # changed.\n+\n+  diff new.yaml old.yaml\n+  ```\n+\n+#### Example of adding a data source\n+\n+Here's an example script for adding a data source to a WebLogic cluster named `cluster-1` for a domain resource in namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`, with domain UID, `sample-domain1`. This example is designed to work on top of the [Model in Image]({{< relref \"/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) sample.\n+\n+This example references a database running in the `default` namespace that is accessed with the URL `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`, user `sys as dba`, and password `Oradoc_db1`. Note that you can still add this data source even if there's no database running at this location.\n+\n+{{% notice note %}} If you already have a WDT config map deployed for your running domain, as is true for the [Model in Image]({{< relref \"/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) sample, then you should ensure that it includes any other needed files that were in the original WDT config map, in addition to the new data source YAML file.

console](#optionally-access-the-weblogic-console)\n+  - [Cleanup](#cleanup)\n+\n+### Introduction\n+\n+This sample demonstrates:\n+\n+  - Using the WebLogic Image Tool to create a Docker image that contains a WebLogic install, a WebLogic Deploy Tool (WDT) install, a Java EE servlet application contained within a WDT archive, and a WebLogic domain that's defined using a WDT model file.\n+  - Modifying the WDT model that's embedded within the Docker image using a WDT model file that's supplied using a Kubernetes config map.\n+  - Defining a `domainHomeSourceType: FromModel` domain resource that references the WDT model image and the WDT config map.\n+  - Deploying the model image, domain resource, model config map, and associated secrets that define user names, passwords, and URL values for the model and its domain resource.\n+  - Deploying and accessing a Traefik load balancer that redirects HTTP protocol calls to its Java EE servlet application.\n+\n+Supported domain types:\n+\n+There are three types of domains supported by Model in Image: a standard `WLS` domain, an Oracle Fusion Middleware Infrastructure Java Required Files (`JRF`) domain, or a `RestrictedJRF` domain.\n+\n+The `JRF` domain path through the sample includes additional steps for deploying an infrastructure database and initializing the database using the Repository Creation Utility (RCU) tool. `JRF` domains may be  used by Oracle products that layer on top of WebLogic Server such as SOA and OSB. Similarly, `RestrictedJRF` domains may be used by Oracle layered products such as Oracle Communications products.\n+\n+### References\n+\n+To reference the relevant user documentation, see:\n+ - [Model in Image User Guide]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) user documentation\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Server Deploy Tooling](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling)\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool)\n+\n+\n+\n+### Prerequisites for all domain types\n+\n+1. The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable must be set and must reference a valid JDK 8 installation. (`JAVA_HOME` is used by the WebLogic Image Tool.)\n+\n+2. Set a source directory environment variable `SRCDIR` that references the parent of the operator source tree. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   mkdir ~/wlopsrc\n+   cd ~/wlopsrc\n+   git clone https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator.git\n+   export SRCDIR=$(pwd)/weblogic-kubernetes-operator\n+   ```\n+\n+   For additional information about obtaining the operator source, see the [Developer Guide Requirements](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/developerguide/requirements/).\n+\n+3. Create a sample directory environment variable `SAMPLEDIR` that references this sample's directory:\n+\n+   ```\n+   export SAMPLEDIR=${SRCDIR}/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image/\n+   ```\n+\n+4. Create an empty, temporary working directory with 10g of space, and store its location in the `WORKDIR` environment variable. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd <location of empty temporary directory with 10g of space>\n+   export WORKDIR=$(pwd)\n+   ```\n+\n+5. Deploy the operator and set up the operator to manage the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`. Optionally, deploy a Traefik load balancer that manages the same namespace. For example, follow the same steps as the [Quick Start](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/quickstart/), up through the [Prepare for a domain]({{< relref \"/quickstart/prepare.md\" >}}) step.\n+\n+   Note that:\n+   - Deploying the Traefik load balancer is optional, but is a prerequisite for testing the web application that's deployed to WebLogic as part of this sample.\n+   - You can skip the Quick Start steps for obtaining a WebLogic image because you will be creating your own Docker image.\n+\n+\n+6. Choose the type of domain you're going to create: `WLS`, `JRF`, or `RestrictedJRF`, and set the environment variable, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, accordingly. The default is `WLS`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   export WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE=<one of WLS, JRF, or RestrictedJRF>\n+   ```\n+\n+7. Set up access to a base image for this sample that will be used as the base image for creating the final image. Do one of the following:\n+\n+   - __Option 1, download an existing WebLogic image.__\n+\n+     Set up access to this sample's base WebLogic image at the [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com):\n+\n+     a. Use a browser to access [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com).\n+\n+     b. Choose an image location:\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF` domains, select `Middleware`, then `fmw-infrastructure`.\n+       - For `WLS` domains, select `Middleware`, then `weblogic`.\n+\n+     c. Select Sign In and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+     d. Use your terminal to locally log in to Docker: `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+\n+     e. Later, when you run the sample, it will call `docker pull` for your base image based on the domain type.\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4`.\n+       - For `WLS`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4`.\n+\n+   - __Option 2, create your own WebLogic base image.__\n+\n+     Alternatively, you can create your own base image and override the sample's default base image name and tag by exporting the `BASE_IMAGE_NAME` and `BASE_IMAGE_TAG` environment variables prior to running the sample scripts. If you want to create your own base image, see [Preparing a Base Image]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-in-image/base-images/_index.md\" >}}).\n+\n+8. If you are using a `JRF` domain type, then it requires an RCU infrastructure database. See [Prerequisites for JRF Domains](#prerequisites-for-jrf-domains). You can do this step before or after you create your final image. If you're not using a `JRF` domain type, proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image).\n+\n+### Prerequisites for JRF domains\n+\n+> __NOTE__: This section is only required for demonstrating a `JRF` domain type. Skip this section and proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image) if your domain type is `WLS` or `RestrictedJRF`.\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database called an RCU database, requires initializing this database, and requires configuring your domain to access this database. All of these steps must occur before you first deploy your domain.\n+\n+Furthermore, if you want to have a restarted JRF domain access updates to the infrastructure database that the domain made at an earlier time, the restarted domain must be supplied a wallet file that was obtained from a previous run of the domain.\n+\n+The following steps demonstrate how to set up an infrastructure database that will work with this sample:\n+\n+  1. [Set up and initialize an RCU database](#set-up-and-initialize-an-rcu-database).\n+  2. [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout).\n+  3. [Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets](#set-up-rcu-model-attributes-domain-resource-attributes-and-secrets).\n+  4. [Reusing or sharing RCU tables](#reusing-or-sharing-rcu-tables).\n+\n+\n+\n+##### Set up and initialize an RCU database\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database and also requires initializing this database with a schema and a set of tables. The following example shows how to set up a sample RCU database and use the RCU tool to create the infrastructure schema for a JRF domain. The RCU database is set up with the following attributes:\n+\n+| Attribute | Value |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| database Kubernetes namespace | `default` |\n+| database Kubernetes pod | `oracle-db` |\n+| database image | `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` |\n+| database password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| infrastructure schema prefix | `FMW1` |\n+| infrastructure schema password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| database URL | `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s` |\n+\n+\n+1. Ensure you have access to the database image, and then deploy it:\n+\n+   - Use a browser to log in to `https://container-registry.oracle.com`, select `database->enterprise` and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+   - Get the database image:\n+     - In the local shell, `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+     - In the local shell, `docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim`.\n+\n+\n+       {{% notice note %}} If a local Docker login and manual pull of `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` is not sufficient (for example, if you are using a remote Kubernetes cluster), then uncomment the `imagePullSecrets` stanza in `$WORKDIR/k8s-db-slim.yaml` and create the image pull secret as follows:\n+\n+              ```\n+              kubectl create secret docker-registry regsecret \\\n+                --docker-server=container-registry.oracle.com \\\n+                --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+                --docker-password=your-password \\\n+                --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+              ```\n+       {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+\n+   - Use the sample script in `$SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service` to create an Oracle database running in the pod, `oracle-db`.\n+\n+      **NOTE**: If your database image access requires the `regsecret` image pull secret that you optionally created above, then pass `-s regsecret` to the `start-db-service.sh` command line.\n+\n+     ```\n+     cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service\n+     start-db-service.sh\n+     ```\n+\n+     This script will deploy a database with the URL, `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`, and administration password, `Oradoc_db1`.\n+\n+     {{% notice warning %}} The Oracle database Docker images are supported only for non-production use. For more details, see My Oracle Support note: Oracle Support for Database Running on Docker (Doc ID 2216342.1) : All the data is gone when the database is restarted.\n+     {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+     **NOTE**: This step is based on the steps documented in [Run a Database](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/userguide/overview/database/).\n+\n+2. Use the sample script in `SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema` to create the RCU schema with the schema prefix `FMW1`.\n+\n+   Note that this script assumes `Oradoc_db1` is the DBA password, `Oradoc_db1` is the schema password, and that the database URL is `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema\n+   ./create-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1 -i container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4\n+   ```\n+\n+   __NOTE__:  If you need to drop the repository, use this command:\n+\n+   ```\n+   drop-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1\n+   ```\n+\n+\n+##### Increase introspection job timeout\n+\n+Because JRF domain home creation takes a considerable amount of time the first time it is created, and because Model in Image creates your domain home for you using the introspection job, you should increase the timeout for the introspection job. Use the `configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds` in `k8s-domain.yaml.template` to override the default with a value of at least 300 seconds (the default is 120 seconds).  \n+\n+##### Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets\n+\n+To allow Model in Image to access the RCU database and OPSS wallet, it's necessary to set up an RCU access secret and an OPSS secret before deploying your domain. It's also necessary to define an `RCUDbInfo` stanza in your model. The sample already sets up all of these for you.  See:\n+\n+| Sample file | Description |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, with `password=welcome1`. |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, with appropriate values for attributes `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string`. |\n+| `model1.yaml.jrf` | Populates the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string` attributes by referencing their locations in the `sample-domain1-rcu-access` secret. The `build.sh` script uses this model instead of `model.yaml.wls` when the source domain type is `JRF`. |\n+| `k8s-domain.yaml.template` | Ensures that the domain mounts the OPSS key secret by setting the domain resource `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` attribute to `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, and ensures the domain mounts the RCU access secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, for reference by WDT model macros by setting the domain resource `configuration.secrets` attribute. Use configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds to increase the timeout value of the introspector job; see [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout). |\n+\n+ **NOTE**: This step is for information purposes only. Do not run the above sample files directly. The sample's main build and run scripts will run them for you.\n+\n+##### Reusing or sharing RCU tables\n+\n+Note that when you succesfully deploy your JRF domain resource for the first time, the introspector job will initialize the RCU tables for the domain using the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza in the WDT model plus the `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` specified in the domain resource. The job will also create a new domain home. Finally, the operator will also capture an OPSS wallet file from the new domain's local directory and place this file in a new Kubernetes config map.\n+\n+There are scenarios when the domain needs to be re-created between updates such as WebLogic credentials are changed, security roles defined in the WDT model have been changed or you want to share the same RCU tables with different domains.  Under these scenarios, the operator needs the `walletPasswordSecret` as well as the OPSS wallet file, together with the exact information in `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` so that the domain can be re-created and access the same set of RCU tables.  Without the wallet file and wallet password, you will not be able to re-create a domain accessing the same set of RCU tables, therefore it is highly recommended to backup the wallet file.\n+\n+To recover a domain's RCU tables between domain restarts or to share an RCU schema between different domains, it is necessary to extract this wallet file from the config map and save the OPSS wallet password secret that was used for the original domain. The wallet password and wallet file are needed again when you recreate the domain or share the database with other domains.\n+\n+To save the wallet file:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -s [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>]\n+```\n+\n+You should back up this file to a safe location that can be retrieved later.\n+\n+To reuse the wallet for subsequent redeployments or share the RCU tables between different domains:\n+\n+1. Store the wallet in a secret:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -r [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>] [-ws <name of the secret. Default DOMAIN_UID-opss-walletfile-secret> ]\n+\n+```\n+\n+2.

You can use the sample `./build.sh` script to build this image, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Uses `docker pull` to obtain a base image. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types) to set up access to the base image.)\n+  - Downloads the latest WebLogic Image Tool and WebLogic Deploy Tool to `WORKDIR`.\n+  - Creates and populates a staging directory `$WORKDIR/models` that contains your WDT model files and WDT application archive.\n+    - Builds  a simple servlet application in `$SAMPLEDIR/sample_app` into a WDT model application archive `$WORKDIR/models/archive1.zip`.\n+    - Copies sample model files from `$SAMPLEDIR/model-in-image` to `$WORKDIR/models`. This uses a model file that is appropriate to the domain type (for example, the `JRF` domain model includes database access configuration).\n+  - Uses the WebLogic Image Tool and the `$WORKDIR/models` staging directory to create a final image named `model-in-image:v1` that layers on the base image. Specifically, it runs the WebLogic Image Tool with its `update` option, which:\n+    - Builds the final image as a layer on the base image.\n+    - Puts a WDT install in image location, `/u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy`.\n+    - Copies the WDT model, properties, and application archive from `$WORDKIR/models` to image location, `/u01/wdt/models`.\n+\n+The script expects `JAVA_HOME`, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).)\n+\n+Run the script:\n+\n+  ```\n+  $SAMPLEDIR/build.sh\n+  ```\n+\n+If you intend to use a remote Docker registry, you need to tag and push the image to the remote Docker registry.\n+\n+1.  Tag the image for the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker tag <image-name>:<tag> <region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>:<tag>\n+```\n+\n+2.  Push the image to the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker push <region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>:<tag>\n+```\n+\n+3. Create the pull secret for the remote Docker registry:\n+\n+```\n+ kubectl -n <domain namespace> create secret docker-registry <secret name> \\\n+     --docker-server=<region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name> \\\n+     --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+     --docker-password=your-password \\\n+     --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+\n+```\n+\n+4. Update the domain template file `$SAMPLEDIR/k8s-domain.yaml.template` to provide the `imagePullSecrets`:\n+\n+```\n+  imagePullSecrets:\n+  - name: <secret name>\n+\n+```\n+\n+5. Export the environment variables for the image name and tag using the same values in step 1:\n+\n+```\n+export MODEL_IMAGE_NAME=\"<region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>\"\n+export MODEL_IMAGE_TAG=\"<tag>\"\n+```\n+\n+### Create and deploy your Kubernetes resources\n+\n+To deploy the sample operator domain and its required Kubernetes resources, use the sample script, `$SAMPLEDIR/run_domain.sh`, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Deletes the domain with a `DomainUID` of `domain1` in the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`, if it already exists.\n+  - Creates a secret containing your WebLogic administrator user name and password.\n+  - Creates a secret containing your Model in Image runtime encryption password:\n+    - All model-in-image domains must supply a runtime encryption secret with a `password` value.\n+    - It is used to encrypt configuration that is passed around internally by the Operator.\n+    - The value must be kept private but can be arbitrary: you can optionally supply a different secret value every time you restart the domain.\n+  - Creates secrets containing your RCU access URL, credentials, and prefix (these are unused unless the domain type is `JRF`).\n+  - Creates a config map containing an additional WDT model properties file, `$SAMPLEDIR/model1.20.properties`.\n+  - Generates a domain resource YAML file, `$WORKDIR/k8s-domain.yaml`, using `$SAMPLEDIR/k8s-domain.yaml.template`.\n+  - Deploys `k8s-domain.yaml`.\n+  - Displays the status of the domain pods.\n+\n+The script expects `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE` and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).)\n+\n+Run the script:\n+\n+  ```\n+  $SAMPLEDIR/run_domain.sh\n+  ```\n+\n+At the end, you will see the message `Getting pod status - ctrl-c when all is running and ready to exit`. Then you should see a WebLogic Administration Server and two Managed Server pods start. After all the pods are up, you can use `ctrl-c` to exit the build script.\n+\n+\n+### Optionally test the sample application\n+\n+1. Ensure Traefik has been installed and is servicing external port 30305, as per [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).\n+\n+2. Create a Kubernetes Ingress for the domain's WebLogic cluster in the domain's namespace by using the sample Helm chart:\n+\n+   For Helm 2.x:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd $SRCDIR\n+   $ helm install kubernetes/samples/charts/ingress-per-domain \\\n+     --name sample-domain1-ingress \\\n+     --namespace sample-domain1-ns \\\n+     --set wlsDomain.domainUID=sample-domain1 \\\n+     --set traefik.hostname=sample-domain1.org\n+   ```\n+\n+   For Helm 3.x:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd $SRCDIR\n+   helm install sample-domain1-ingress kubernetes/samples/charts/ingress-per-domain \\\n+    --namespace sample-domain1-ns \\\n+    --set wlsDomain.domainUID=sample-domain1 \\\n+    --set traefik.hostname=sample-domain1.org\n+   ```\n+\n+   This creates an Kubernetes Ingress that helps route HTTP traffic from the Traefik load balancer's external port 30305 to the WebLogic domain's `cluster-1` 8001 port. Note that the WDT config map in this sample changes the cluster's port from 9001 to 8001 (9001 is the original port configured using the WDT model defined within in the image).\n+\n+3. Send a web application request to the load balancer:\n+\n+   ```\n+   curl -H 'host: sample-domain1.org' http://$(hostname).$(dnsdomainname):30305/sample_war/index.jsp\n+   ```\n+\n+   You should see something like the following:\n+\n+   ```\n+   Hello World, you have reached server managed-server1\n+   ```\n+\n+   **Note**: If you're running on a remote Kubernetes cluster, then substitute `$(hostname).$(dnsdomainname)` with an external address suitable for contacting the cluster.\n+\n+4. Send a ReadyApp request to the load balancer (ReadyApp is a built-in WebLogic Server application):\n+\n+   ```\n+   curl -v -H 'host: sample-domain1.org' http://$(hostname).$(dnsdomainname):30305/weblogic/ready\n+   ```\n+\n+   You should see something like the following:\n+\n+\n+   ```\n+   * About to connect() to myhost.my.dns.domain.name port 30305 (#0)\n+   *   Trying 100.111.142.32...\n+   * Connected to myhost.my.dns.domain.name (100.111.142.32) port 30305 (#0)\n+   > GET /weblogic/ready HTTP/1.1\n+   > User-Agent: curl/7.29.0\n+   > Accept: */*\n+   > host: sample-domain1.org\n+   >\n+   < HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n+   < Content-Length: 0\n+   < Date: Mon, 09 Mar 2020 20:40:37 GMT\n+   < Vary: Accept-Encoding\n+   <\n+   * Connection #0 to host myhost.my.dns.domain.name left intact\n+   ```\n+\n+   **Note**: If you're running on a remote Kubernetes cluster, then substitute `$(hostname).$(dnsdomainname)` with an external address suitable for contacting the cluster.\n+\n+### Optionally access the WebLogic console", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "89880074649148f0d832e0b96163913ef9baf5f9"}, "originalPosition": 417}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5NzUyMDAyMw==", "bodyText": "done.", "url": "https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/pull/1478#discussion_r397520023", "createdAt": "2020-03-24T23:21:17Z", "author": {"login": "tbarnes-us"}, "path": "docs-source/content/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,520 @@\n+---\n+title: \"Model in image\"\n+date: 2019-02-23T17:32:31-05:00\n+weight: 4\n+description: \"Sample for supplying a WebLogic Deploy Tool (WDT) model that the operator automatically expands into a full domain home during runtime.\"\n+---\n+\n+### Contents\n+\n+  - [Introduction](#introduction)\n+  - [References](#references)\n+  - [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types)\n+  - [Prerequisites for JRF domains](#prerequisites-for-jrf-domains)\n+    - [Set Up and Initialize an RCU Database](#set-up-and-initialize-an-rcu-database)\n+    - [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout)\n+    - [Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets](#set-up-rcu-model-attributes-domain-resource-attributes-and-secrets)\n+    - [Reusing or sharing RCU tables](#reusing-or-sharing-rcu-tables)\n+  - [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image)\n+  - [Create and deploy your Kubernetes resources](#create-and-deploy-your-kubernetes-resources)\n+  - [Optionally test the sample application](#optionally-test-the-sample-application)\n+  - [Optionally access the WebLogic console](#optionally-access-the-weblogic-console)\n+  - [Cleanup](#cleanup)\n+\n+### Introduction\n+\n+This sample demonstrates:\n+\n+  - Using the WebLogic Image Tool to create a Docker image that contains a WebLogic install, a WebLogic Deploy Tool (WDT) install, a Java EE servlet application contained within a WDT archive, and a WebLogic domain that's defined using a WDT model file.\n+  - Modifying the WDT model that's embedded within the Docker image using a WDT model file that's supplied using a Kubernetes config map.\n+  - Defining a `domainHomeSourceType: FromModel` domain resource that references the WDT model image and the WDT config map.\n+  - Deploying the model image, domain resource, model config map, and associated secrets that define user names, passwords, and URL values for the model and its domain resource.\n+  - Deploying and accessing a Traefik load balancer that redirects HTTP protocol calls to its Java EE servlet application.\n+\n+Supported domain types:\n+\n+There are three types of domains supported by Model in Image: a standard `WLS` domain, an Oracle Fusion Middleware Infrastructure Java Required Files (`JRF`) domain, or a `RestrictedJRF` domain.\n+\n+The `JRF` domain path through the sample includes additional steps for deploying an infrastructure database and initializing the database using the Repository Creation Utility (RCU) tool. `JRF` domains may be  used by Oracle products that layer on top of WebLogic Server such as SOA and OSB. Similarly, `RestrictedJRF` domains may be used by Oracle layered products such as Oracle Communications products.\n+\n+### References\n+\n+To reference the relevant user documentation, see:\n+ - [Model in Image User Guide]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) user documentation\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Server Deploy Tooling](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling)\n+ - [Oracle WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool)\n+\n+\n+\n+### Prerequisites for all domain types\n+\n+1. The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable must be set and must reference a valid JDK 8 installation. (`JAVA_HOME` is used by the WebLogic Image Tool.)\n+\n+2. Set a source directory environment variable `SRCDIR` that references the parent of the operator source tree. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   mkdir ~/wlopsrc\n+   cd ~/wlopsrc\n+   git clone https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator.git\n+   export SRCDIR=$(pwd)/weblogic-kubernetes-operator\n+   ```\n+\n+   For additional information about obtaining the operator source, see the [Developer Guide Requirements](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/developerguide/requirements/).\n+\n+3. Create a sample directory environment variable `SAMPLEDIR` that references this sample's directory:\n+\n+   ```\n+   export SAMPLEDIR=${SRCDIR}/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image/\n+   ```\n+\n+4. Create an empty, temporary working directory with 10g of space, and store its location in the `WORKDIR` environment variable. For example:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd <location of empty temporary directory with 10g of space>\n+   export WORKDIR=$(pwd)\n+   ```\n+\n+5. Deploy the operator and set up the operator to manage the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`. Optionally, deploy a Traefik load balancer that manages the same namespace. For example, follow the same steps as the [Quick Start](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/quickstart/), up through the [Prepare for a domain]({{< relref \"/quickstart/prepare.md\" >}}) step.\n+\n+   Note that:\n+   - Deploying the Traefik load balancer is optional, but is a prerequisite for testing the web application that's deployed to WebLogic as part of this sample.\n+   - You can skip the Quick Start steps for obtaining a WebLogic image because you will be creating your own Docker image.\n+\n+\n+6. Choose the type of domain you're going to create: `WLS`, `JRF`, or `RestrictedJRF`, and set the environment variable, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, accordingly. The default is `WLS`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   export WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE=<one of WLS, JRF, or RestrictedJRF>\n+   ```\n+\n+7. Set up access to a base image for this sample that will be used as the base image for creating the final image. Do one of the following:\n+\n+   - __Option 1, download an existing WebLogic image.__\n+\n+     Set up access to this sample's base WebLogic image at the [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com):\n+\n+     a. Use a browser to access [Oracle Container Registry](http://container-registry.oracle.com).\n+\n+     b. Choose an image location:\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF` domains, select `Middleware`, then `fmw-infrastructure`.\n+       - For `WLS` domains, select `Middleware`, then `weblogic`.\n+\n+     c. Select Sign In and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+     d. Use your terminal to locally log in to Docker: `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+\n+     e. Later, when you run the sample, it will call `docker pull` for your base image based on the domain type.\n+       - For `JRF` and `RestrictedJRF`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4`.\n+       - For `WLS`, it will pull `container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic:12.2.1.4`.\n+\n+   - __Option 2, create your own WebLogic base image.__\n+\n+     Alternatively, you can create your own base image and override the sample's default base image name and tag by exporting the `BASE_IMAGE_NAME` and `BASE_IMAGE_TAG` environment variables prior to running the sample scripts. If you want to create your own base image, see [Preparing a Base Image]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-in-image/base-images/_index.md\" >}}).\n+\n+8. If you are using a `JRF` domain type, then it requires an RCU infrastructure database. See [Prerequisites for JRF Domains](#prerequisites-for-jrf-domains). You can do this step before or after you create your final image. If you're not using a `JRF` domain type, proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image).\n+\n+### Prerequisites for JRF domains\n+\n+> __NOTE__: This section is only required for demonstrating a `JRF` domain type. Skip this section and proceed to [Use the WebLogic Image Tool to create an image](#use-the-weblogic-image-tool-to-create-an-image) if your domain type is `WLS` or `RestrictedJRF`.\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database called an RCU database, requires initializing this database, and requires configuring your domain to access this database. All of these steps must occur before you first deploy your domain.\n+\n+Furthermore, if you want to have a restarted JRF domain access updates to the infrastructure database that the domain made at an earlier time, the restarted domain must be supplied a wallet file that was obtained from a previous run of the domain.\n+\n+The following steps demonstrate how to set up an infrastructure database that will work with this sample:\n+\n+  1. [Set up and initialize an RCU database](#set-up-and-initialize-an-rcu-database).\n+  2. [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout).\n+  3. [Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets](#set-up-rcu-model-attributes-domain-resource-attributes-and-secrets).\n+  4. [Reusing or sharing RCU tables](#reusing-or-sharing-rcu-tables).\n+\n+\n+\n+##### Set up and initialize an RCU database\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database and also requires initializing this database with a schema and a set of tables. The following example shows how to set up a sample RCU database and use the RCU tool to create the infrastructure schema for a JRF domain. The RCU database is set up with the following attributes:\n+\n+| Attribute | Value |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| database Kubernetes namespace | `default` |\n+| database Kubernetes pod | `oracle-db` |\n+| database image | `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` |\n+| database password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| infrastructure schema prefix | `FMW1` |\n+| infrastructure schema password | `Oradoc_db1` |\n+| database URL | `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s` |\n+\n+\n+1. Ensure you have access to the database image, and then deploy it:\n+\n+   - Use a browser to log in to `https://container-registry.oracle.com`, select `database->enterprise` and accept the license agreement.\n+\n+   - Get the database image:\n+     - In the local shell, `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.\n+     - In the local shell, `docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim`.\n+\n+\n+       {{% notice note %}} If a local Docker login and manual pull of `container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim` is not sufficient (for example, if you are using a remote Kubernetes cluster), then uncomment the `imagePullSecrets` stanza in `$WORKDIR/k8s-db-slim.yaml` and create the image pull secret as follows:\n+\n+              ```\n+              kubectl create secret docker-registry regsecret \\\n+                --docker-server=container-registry.oracle.com \\\n+                --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+                --docker-password=your-password \\\n+                --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+              ```\n+       {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+\n+   - Use the sample script in `$SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service` to create an Oracle database running in the pod, `oracle-db`.\n+\n+      **NOTE**: If your database image access requires the `regsecret` image pull secret that you optionally created above, then pass `-s regsecret` to the `start-db-service.sh` command line.\n+\n+     ```\n+     cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-oracle-db-service\n+     start-db-service.sh\n+     ```\n+\n+     This script will deploy a database with the URL, `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`, and administration password, `Oradoc_db1`.\n+\n+     {{% notice warning %}} The Oracle database Docker images are supported only for non-production use. For more details, see My Oracle Support note: Oracle Support for Database Running on Docker (Doc ID 2216342.1) : All the data is gone when the database is restarted.\n+     {{% /notice %}}\n+\n+     **NOTE**: This step is based on the steps documented in [Run a Database](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/userguide/overview/database/).\n+\n+2. Use the sample script in `SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema` to create the RCU schema with the schema prefix `FMW1`.\n+\n+   Note that this script assumes `Oradoc_db1` is the DBA password, `Oradoc_db1` is the schema password, and that the database URL is `oracle-db.default.svc.cluster.local:1521/devpdb.k8s`.\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd $SRCDIR/kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-rcu-schema\n+   ./create-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1 -i container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.4\n+   ```\n+\n+   __NOTE__:  If you need to drop the repository, use this command:\n+\n+   ```\n+   drop-rcu-schema.sh -s FMW1\n+   ```\n+\n+\n+##### Increase introspection job timeout\n+\n+Because JRF domain home creation takes a considerable amount of time the first time it is created, and because Model in Image creates your domain home for you using the introspection job, you should increase the timeout for the introspection job. Use the `configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds` in `k8s-domain.yaml.template` to override the default with a value of at least 300 seconds (the default is 120 seconds).  \n+\n+##### Set up RCU model attributes, domain resource attributes, and secrets\n+\n+To allow Model in Image to access the RCU database and OPSS wallet, it's necessary to set up an RCU access secret and an OPSS secret before deploying your domain. It's also necessary to define an `RCUDbInfo` stanza in your model. The sample already sets up all of these for you.  See:\n+\n+| Sample file | Description |\n+| --------- | ----- |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, with `password=welcome1`. |\n+| `run_domain.sh` | Defines secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, with appropriate values for attributes `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string`. |\n+| `model1.yaml.jrf` | Populates the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza `rcu_prefix`, `rcu_schema_password`, and `rcu_db_conn_string` attributes by referencing their locations in the `sample-domain1-rcu-access` secret. The `build.sh` script uses this model instead of `model.yaml.wls` when the source domain type is `JRF`. |\n+| `k8s-domain.yaml.template` | Ensures that the domain mounts the OPSS key secret by setting the domain resource `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` attribute to `sample-domain1-opss-wallet-password-secret`, and ensures the domain mounts the RCU access secret, `sample-domain1-rcu-access`, for reference by WDT model macros by setting the domain resource `configuration.secrets` attribute. Use configuration.introspectorJobActiveDeadlineSeconds to increase the timeout value of the introspector job; see [Increase introspection job timeout](#increase-introspection-job-timeout). |\n+\n+ **NOTE**: This step is for information purposes only. Do not run the above sample files directly. The sample's main build and run scripts will run them for you.\n+\n+##### Reusing or sharing RCU tables\n+\n+Note that when you succesfully deploy your JRF domain resource for the first time, the introspector job will initialize the RCU tables for the domain using the `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` stanza in the WDT model plus the `configuration.opss.walletPasswordSecret` specified in the domain resource. The job will also create a new domain home. Finally, the operator will also capture an OPSS wallet file from the new domain's local directory and place this file in a new Kubernetes config map.\n+\n+There are scenarios when the domain needs to be re-created between updates such as WebLogic credentials are changed, security roles defined in the WDT model have been changed or you want to share the same RCU tables with different domains.  Under these scenarios, the operator needs the `walletPasswordSecret` as well as the OPSS wallet file, together with the exact information in `domainInfo -> RCUDbInfo` so that the domain can be re-created and access the same set of RCU tables.  Without the wallet file and wallet password, you will not be able to re-create a domain accessing the same set of RCU tables, therefore it is highly recommended to backup the wallet file.\n+\n+To recover a domain's RCU tables between domain restarts or to share an RCU schema between different domains, it is necessary to extract this wallet file from the config map and save the OPSS wallet password secret that was used for the original domain. The wallet password and wallet file are needed again when you recreate the domain or share the database with other domains.\n+\n+To save the wallet file:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -s [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>]\n+```\n+\n+You should back up this file to a safe location that can be retrieved later.\n+\n+To reuse the wallet for subsequent redeployments or share the RCU tables between different domains:\n+\n+1. Store the wallet in a secret:\n+\n+```\n+    opss_wallet_util.sh -r [-wf <name of the wallet file. Default ./ewallet.p12>] [-ws <name of the secret. Default DOMAIN_UID-opss-walletfile-secret> ]\n+\n+```\n+\n+2.

You can use the sample `./build.sh` script to build this image, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Uses `docker pull` to obtain a base image. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types) to set up access to the base image.)\n+  - Downloads the latest WebLogic Image Tool and WebLogic Deploy Tool to `WORKDIR`.\n+  - Creates and populates a staging directory `$WORKDIR/models` that contains your WDT model files and WDT application archive.\n+    - Builds  a simple servlet application in `$SAMPLEDIR/sample_app` into a WDT model application archive `$WORKDIR/models/archive1.zip`.\n+    - Copies sample model files from `$SAMPLEDIR/model-in-image` to `$WORKDIR/models`. This uses a model file that is appropriate to the domain type (for example, the `JRF` domain model includes database access configuration).\n+  - Uses the WebLogic Image Tool and the `$WORKDIR/models` staging directory to create a final image named `model-in-image:v1` that layers on the base image. Specifically, it runs the WebLogic Image Tool with its `update` option, which:\n+    - Builds the final image as a layer on the base image.\n+    - Puts a WDT install in image location, `/u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy`.\n+    - Copies the WDT model, properties, and application archive from `$WORDKIR/models` to image location, `/u01/wdt/models`.\n+\n+The script expects `JAVA_HOME`, `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE`, and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).)\n+\n+Run the script:\n+\n+  ```\n+  $SAMPLEDIR/build.sh\n+  ```\n+\n+If you intend to use a remote Docker registry, you need to tag and push the image to the remote Docker registry.\n+\n+1.  Tag the image for the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker tag <image-name>:<tag> <region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>:<tag>\n+```\n+\n+2.  Push the image to the remote Docker registry, for example:\n+\n+```\n+docker push <region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>:<tag>\n+```\n+\n+3. Create the pull secret for the remote Docker registry:\n+\n+```\n+ kubectl -n <domain namespace> create secret docker-registry <secret name> \\\n+     --docker-server=<region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name> \\\n+     --docker-username=your.email@some.com \\\n+     --docker-password=your-password \\\n+     --docker-email=your.email@some.com\n+\n+```\n+\n+4. Update the domain template file `$SAMPLEDIR/k8s-domain.yaml.template` to provide the `imagePullSecrets`:\n+\n+```\n+  imagePullSecrets:\n+  - name: <secret name>\n+\n+```\n+\n+5. Export the environment variables for the image name and tag using the same values in step 1:\n+\n+```\n+export MODEL_IMAGE_NAME=\"<region-key>.ocir.io/<tenancy-namespace>/<repo-name>/<image-name>\"\n+export MODEL_IMAGE_TAG=\"<tag>\"\n+```\n+\n+### Create and deploy your Kubernetes resources\n+\n+To deploy the sample operator domain and its required Kubernetes resources, use the sample script, `$SAMPLEDIR/run_domain.sh`, which will perform the following steps for you:\n+\n+  - Deletes the domain with a `DomainUID` of `domain1` in the namespace, `sample-domain1-ns`, if it already exists.\n+  - Creates a secret containing your WebLogic administrator user name and password.\n+  - Creates a secret containing your Model in Image runtime encryption password:\n+    - All model-in-image domains must supply a runtime encryption secret with a `password` value.\n+    - It is used to encrypt configuration that is passed around internally by the Operator.\n+    - The value must be kept private but can be arbitrary: you can optionally supply a different secret value every time you restart the domain.\n+  - Creates secrets containing your RCU access URL, credentials, and prefix (these are unused unless the domain type is `JRF`).\n+  - Creates a config map containing an additional WDT model properties file, `$SAMPLEDIR/model1.20.properties`.\n+  - Generates a domain resource YAML file, `$WORKDIR/k8s-domain.yaml`, using `$SAMPLEDIR/k8s-domain.yaml.template`.\n+  - Deploys `k8s-domain.yaml`.\n+  - Displays the status of the domain pods.\n+\n+The script expects `WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE` and `WORKDIR` to already be initialized. (See [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).)\n+\n+Run the script:\n+\n+  ```\n+  $SAMPLEDIR/run_domain.sh\n+  ```\n+\n+At the end, you will see the message `Getting pod status - ctrl-c when all is running and ready to exit`. Then you should see a WebLogic Administration Server and two Managed Server pods start. After all the pods are up, you can use `ctrl-c` to exit the build script.\n+\n+\n+### Optionally test the sample application\n+\n+1. Ensure Traefik has been installed and is servicing external port 30305, as per [Prerequisites for all domain types](#prerequisites-for-all-domain-types).\n+\n+2. Create a Kubernetes Ingress for the domain's WebLogic cluster in the domain's namespace by using the sample Helm chart:\n+\n+   For Helm 2.x:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd $SRCDIR\n+   $ helm install kubernetes/samples/charts/ingress-per-domain \\\n+     --name sample-domain1-ingress \\\n+     --namespace sample-domain1-ns \\\n+     --set wlsDomain.domainUID=sample-domain1 \\\n+     --set traefik.hostname=sample-domain1.org\n+   ```\n+\n+   For Helm 3.x:\n+\n+   ```\n+   cd $SRCDIR\n+   helm install sample-domain1-ingress kubernetes/samples/charts/ingress-per-domain \\\n+    --namespace sample-domain1-ns \\\n+    --set wlsDomain.domainUID=sample-domain1 \\\n+    --set traefik.hostname=sample-domain1.org\n+   ```\n+\n+   This creates an Kubernetes Ingress that helps route HTTP traffic from the Traefik load balancer's external port 30305 to the WebLogic domain's `cluster-1` 8001 port. Note that the WDT config map in this sample changes the cluster's port from 9001 to 8001 (9001 is the original port configured using the WDT model defined within in the image).\n+\n+3. Send a web application request to the load balancer:\n+\n+   ```\n+   curl -H 'host: sample-domain1.org' http://$(hostname).$(dnsdomainname):30305/sample_war/index.jsp\n+   ```\n+\n+   You should see something like the following:\n+\n+   ```\n+   Hello World, you have reached server managed-server1\n+   ```\n+\n+   **Note**: If you're running on a remote Kubernetes cluster, then substitute `$(hostname).$(dnsdomainname)` with an external address suitable for contacting the cluster.\n+\n+4. Send a ReadyApp request to the load balancer (ReadyApp is a built-in WebLogic Server application):\n+\n+   ```\n+   curl -v -H 'host: sample-domain1.org' http://$(hostname).$(dnsdomainname):30305/weblogic/ready\n+   ```\n+\n+   You should see something like the following:\n+\n+\n+   ```\n+   * About to connect() to myhost.my.dns.domain.name port 30305 (#0)\n+   *   Trying 100.111.142.32...\n+   * Connected to myhost.my.dns.domain.name (100.111.142.32) port 30305 (#0)\n+   > GET /weblogic/ready HTTP/1.1\n+   > User-Agent: curl/7.29.0\n+   > Accept: */*\n+   > host: sample-domain1.org\n+   >\n+   < HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n+   < Content-Length: 0\n+   < Date: Mon, 09 Mar 2020 20:40:37 GMT\n+   < Vary: Accept-Encoding\n+   <\n+   * Connection #0 to host myhost.my.dns.domain.name left intact\n+   ```\n+\n+   **Note**: If you're running on a remote Kubernetes cluster, then substitute `$(hostname).$(dnsdomainname)` with an external address suitable for contacting the cluster.\n+\n+### Optionally access the WebLogic console", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5Njc4NzM4NQ=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "89880074649148f0d832e0b96163913ef9baf5f9"}, "originalPosition": 417}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMjQ2MzM1NDMxOnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "operator/src/main/java/oracle/kubernetes/operator/work/Packet.java", "isResolved": true, "comments": {"totalCount": 4, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMy0yNFQxODo0MzoyMFrOF6-Q6Q==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMy0yNFQxOTo1NToyNlrOF7AvSw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5NzM4MTg2NQ==", "bodyText": "Okay, this is the wrong spot for this.

These items do not need to be created in order.\n+\n+#### 1. WebLogic operator\n+\n+Deploy a WebLogic operator and ensure that it is monitoring the desired namespace for your Model in Image domain. See [Manage operators]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-operators/_index.md\" >}}) and [Quick Start]({{< relref \"/quickstart/_index.md\" >}}).\n+\n+#### 2. WebLogic image\n+\n+Model in Image requires creating a 'final' deployable image that has WebLogic Server and WDT installed, plus your model and application files.\n+\n+You can start with a WebLogic 12.2.1.3 or later pre-built base image obtained from [Docker Hub](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/master/OracleWebLogic) or similar, manually build your own base image as per [Preparing a Base Image]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-in-image/base-images/_index.md\" >}}), or build a base image using the [WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool). Note that any 12.2.1.3 image must also include patch 29135930 (the pre-built images already contain this patch). For an example of the first approach for both WLS and JRF domains, see the [Model in Image]({{< relref \"/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) sample.\n+\n+After you have a base image, Model in Image requires layering the following directory structure for its (optional) WDT models artifacts and (required) WDT binaries:\n+\n+| Directory                | Contents                           | Extension   |\n+| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------- |\n+| `/u01/wdt/models`         | Optional domain model YAML files   | .yaml       |\n+| `/u01/wdt/models`         | Optional model variable files      | .properties |\n+| `/u01/wdt/models`         | Optional application archives      | .zip        |\n+| `/u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy`| Unzipped WebLogic deploy install   |             |\n+\n+There are two methods for layering Model in Image artifacts on top of a base image:\n+\n+  - **Manual Image Creation**: Use Docker commands to layer the WDT artifacts from the above table on top of your base image into a new image.\n+\n+  - **WebLogic Image Tool**: Use the convenient [WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool). The WebLogic Image Tool (WIT) has built-in options for embedding WDT model files, WDT binaries, WebLogic Server binaries, and WebLogic Server patches in an image. The [Model in Image]({{< relref \"/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) sample uses the WIT approach. For an example, see the sample's `build_image_model.sh` file in the operator source's `kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image` directory.\n+\n+For a discussion of model file syntax, see [Model files]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md\" >}}).\n+\n+#### 3. Optional WDT model config map\n+\n+You can create a WDT model config map that defines additional model `.yaml` and `.properties` files beyond what you've already supplied in your image, and then reference this config map using your domain resource's `configuration.model.configMap` attribute. This is optional if the supplied image already fully defines your model.\n+\n+WDT model config map files will be merged with the WDT files defined in your image at runtime before your domain home is created. The config map files can add to, remove from, or alter the model configuration that you supplied within your image.\n+\n+For example, place additional `.yaml` and `.properties` files in a directory called `/home/acmeuser/wdtoverride` and run the following commands:\n+\n+  ```\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    create configmap MY-DOMAINUID-my-wdt-config-map \\\n+    --from-file /home/acmeuser/wdtoverride\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    label  configmap MY-DOMAINUID-my-wdt-config-map \\\n+    weblogic.domainUID=MY-DOMAINUID\n+  ```\n+\n+See [Model files]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md\" >}}) for a discussion of model file syntax and loading order, and see [Runtime updates]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/runtime-updates.md\" >}}) for a discussion of using WDT model config maps to update the model configuration of a running domain.\n+\n+\n+#### 4. Required runtime encryption secret\n+\n+Model in Image requires a runtime encryption secret with a secure `password` key. This secret is used by the operator to encrypt model and domain home artifacts before it adds them to a runtime config map or log. The `password` that you set can safely change any time after you've fully shut down a domain but must remain the same for the life of a running domain. The runtime encryption secret that you create can be named anything but note that it is a best practice to name and label secrets with their domain UID to help ensure that cleanup scripts can find and delete them.\n+\n+**NOTE**: Because the runtime encryption password does not need to be shared and only needs to exist for the life of a domain, you may want to use a password generator.\n+\n+Example:\n+\n+  ```\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    create secret generic MY-DOMAINUID-runtime-encrypt-secret \\\n+    --from-literal=password=welcome1\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    label secret MY-DOMAINUID-runtime-encrypt-secret \\\n+    weblogic.domainUID=MY-DOMAINUID\n+  ```\n+\n+Corresponding domain resource snippet:\n+\n+  ```\n+  configuration:\n+    model:\n+      runtimeEncryptionSecret: MY-DOMAINUID-runtime-encrypt-secret\n+  ```\n+\n+#### 5. Secrets for model macros\n+\n+Create additional secrets as needed by macros in your model files. For example, these can store database URLs and credentials that are accessed using `@@SECRET` macros in your model that reference the secrets.  For a discussion of model macros, see [Model files]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md\" >}}).\n+\n+#### 6. Domain resource attributes\n+\n+The following domain resource attributes are specific to Model in Image domains.\n+\n+| Domain Resource Attribute                    |  Notes |\n+| -------------------------                    |  ------------------ |\n+| `domainHomeSourceType`                       |  Required.

The WebLogic Image Tool (WIT) has built-in options for embedding WDT model files, WDT binaries, WebLogic Server binaries, and WebLogic Server patches in an image. The [Model in Image]({{< relref \"/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) sample uses the WIT approach. For an example, see the sample's `build_image_model.sh` file in the operator source's `kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image` directory.\n+\n+For a discussion of model file syntax, see [Model files]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md\" >}}).\n+\n+#### 3. Optional WDT model config map\n+\n+You can create a WDT model config map that defines additional model `.yaml` and `.properties` files beyond what you've already supplied in your image, and then reference this config map using your domain resource's `configuration.model.configMap` attribute. This is optional if the supplied image already fully defines your model.\n+\n+WDT model config map files will be merged with the WDT files defined in your image at runtime before your domain home is created. The config map files can add to, remove from, or alter the model configuration that you supplied within your image.\n+\n+For example, place additional `.yaml` and `.properties` files in a directory called `/home/acmeuser/wdtoverride` and run the following commands:\n+\n+  ```\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    create configmap MY-DOMAINUID-my-wdt-config-map \\\n+    --from-file /home/acmeuser/wdtoverride\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    label  configmap MY-DOMAINUID-my-wdt-config-map \\\n+    weblogic.domainUID=MY-DOMAINUID\n+  ```\n+\n+See [Model files]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md\" >}}) for a discussion of model file syntax and loading order, and see [Runtime updates]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/runtime-updates.md\" >}}) for a discussion of using WDT model config maps to update the model configuration of a running domain.\n+\n+\n+#### 4. Required runtime encryption secret\n+\n+Model in Image requires a runtime encryption secret with a secure `password` key. This secret is used by the operator to encrypt model and domain home artifacts before it adds them to a runtime config map or log. The `password` that you set can safely change any time after you've fully shut down a domain but must remain the same for the life of a running domain. The runtime encryption secret that you create can be named anything but note that it is a best practice to name and label secrets with their domain UID to help ensure that cleanup scripts can find and delete them.\n+\n+**NOTE**: Because the runtime encryption password does not need to be shared and only needs to exist for the life of a domain, you may want to use a password generator.\n+\n+Example:\n+\n+  ```\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    create secret generic MY-DOMAINUID-runtime-encrypt-secret \\\n+    --from-literal=password=welcome1\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    label secret MY-DOMAINUID-runtime-encrypt-secret \\\n+    weblogic.domainUID=MY-DOMAINUID\n+  ```\n+\n+Corresponding domain resource snippet:\n+\n+  ```\n+  configuration:\n+    model:\n+      runtimeEncryptionSecret: MY-DOMAINUID-runtime-encrypt-secret\n+  ```\n+\n+#### 5. Secrets for model macros\n+\n+Create additional secrets as needed by macros in your model files. For example, these can store database URLs and credentials that are accessed using `@@SECRET` macros in your model that reference the secrets.  For a discussion of model macros, see [Model files]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md\" >}}).\n+\n+#### 6.

These items do not need to be created in order.\n+\n+#### 1. WebLogic operator\n+\n+Deploy a WebLogic operator and ensure that it is monitoring the desired namespace for your Model in Image domain. See [Manage operators]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-operators/_index.md\" >}}) and [Quick Start]({{< relref \"/quickstart/_index.md\" >}}).\n+\n+#### 2. WebLogic image\n+\n+Model in Image requires creating a 'final' deployable image that has WebLogic Server and WDT installed, plus your model and application files.\n+\n+You can start with a WebLogic 12.2.1.3 or later pre-built base image obtained from [Docker Hub](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/master/OracleWebLogic) or similar, manually build your own base image as per [Preparing a Base Image]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-in-image/base-images/_index.md\" >}}), or build a base image using the [WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool). Note that any 12.2.1.3 image must also include patch 29135930 (the pre-built images already contain this patch). For an example of the first approach for both WLS and JRF domains, see the [Model in Image]({{< relref \"/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) sample.\n+\n+After you have a base image, Model in Image requires layering the following directory structure for its (optional) WDT models artifacts and (required) WDT binaries:\n+\n+| Directory                | Contents                           | Extension   |\n+| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------- |\n+| `/u01/wdt/models`         | Optional domain model YAML files   | .yaml       |\n+| `/u01/wdt/models`         | Optional model variable files      | .properties |\n+| `/u01/wdt/models`         | Optional application archives      | .zip        |\n+| `/u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy`| Unzipped WebLogic deploy install   |             |\n+\n+There are two methods for layering Model in Image artifacts on top of a base image:\n+\n+  - **Manual Image Creation**: Use Docker commands to layer the WDT artifacts from the above table on top of your base image into a new image.\n+\n+  - **WebLogic Image Tool**: Use the convenient [WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool). The WebLogic Image Tool (WIT) has built-in options for embedding WDT model files, WDT binaries, WebLogic Server binaries, and WebLogic Server patches in an image. The [Model in Image]({{< relref \"/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) sample uses the WIT approach. For an example, see the sample's `build_image_model.sh` file in the operator source's `kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image` directory.\n+\n+For a discussion of model file syntax, see [Model files]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md\" >}}).\n+\n+#### 3. Optional WDT model config map\n+\n+You can create a WDT model config map that defines additional model `.yaml` and `.properties` files beyond what you've already supplied in your image, and then reference this config map using your domain resource's `configuration.model.configMap` attribute. This is optional if the supplied image already fully defines your model.\n+\n+WDT model config map files will be merged with the WDT files defined in your image at runtime before your domain home is created. The config map files can add to, remove from, or alter the model configuration that you supplied within your image.\n+\n+For example, place additional `.yaml` and `.properties` files in a directory called `/home/acmeuser/wdtoverride` and run the following commands:\n+\n+  ```\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    create configmap MY-DOMAINUID-my-wdt-config-map \\\n+    --from-file /home/acmeuser/wdtoverride\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    label  configmap MY-DOMAINUID-my-wdt-config-map \\\n+    weblogic.domainUID=MY-DOMAINUID\n+  ```\n+\n+See [Model files]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md\" >}}) for a discussion of model file syntax and loading order, and see [Runtime updates]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/runtime-updates.md\" >}}) for a discussion of using WDT model config maps to update the model configuration of a running domain.\n+\n+\n+#### 4. Required runtime encryption secret\n+\n+Model in Image requires a runtime encryption secret with a secure `password` key. This secret is used by the operator to encrypt model and domain home artifacts before it adds them to a runtime config map or log. The `password` that you set can safely change any time after you've fully shut down a domain but must remain the same for the life of a running domain. The runtime encryption secret that you create can be named anything but note that it is a best practice to name and label secrets with their domain UID to help ensure that cleanup scripts can find and delete them.\n+\n+**NOTE**: Because the runtime encryption password does not need to be shared and only needs to exist for the life of a domain, you may want to use a password generator.\n+\n+Example:\n+\n+  ```\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    create secret generic MY-DOMAINUID-runtime-encrypt-secret \\\n+    --from-literal=password=welcome1\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    label secret MY-DOMAINUID-runtime-encrypt-secret \\\n+    weblogic.domainUID=MY-DOMAINUID\n+  ```\n+\n+Corresponding domain resource snippet:\n+\n+  ```\n+  configuration:\n+    model:\n+      runtimeEncryptionSecret: MY-DOMAINUID-runtime-encrypt-secret\n+  ```\n+\n+#### 5. Secrets for model macros\n+\n+Create additional secrets as needed by macros in your model files. For example, these can store database URLs and credentials that are accessed using `@@SECRET` macros in your model that reference the secrets.  For a discussion of model macros, see [Model files]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md\" >}}).\n+\n+#### 6. Domain resource attributes\n+\n+The following domain resource attributes are specific to Model in Image domains.\n+\n+| Domain Resource Attribute                    |  Notes |\n+| -------------------------                    |  ------------------ |\n+| `domainHomeSourceType`                       |  Required. Set to `FromModel`. |\n+| `domainHome`                                 |  Must reference an empty or non-existent directory within your image. Do not include the mount path of any persistent volume. Note that Model in Image recreates the domain home for a WebLogic pod every time the pod restarts.|\n+| `configuration.model.configMap`             | Optional. Set if you have stored additional models in a config map as per [Optional WDT model config map](#3-optional-wdt-model-config-map). |\n+| `configuration.secrets`                      | Optional. Set this array if your image or config map models contain macros that reference custom Kubernetes secrets. For example, if your macros depend on secrets `my-secret` and `my-other-secret`, then set to `[my-secret, my-other-secret]`.|\n+| `configuration.model.RuntimeEncryptionSecret`| Required. All Model in Image domains must specify a runtime encryption secret. See [Required runtime encryption secret](#4-required-runtime-encryption-secret). |\n+| `configuration.model.domainType`             | Set the type of domain. Valid values are `WLS`, `JRF`, and `RestrictedJRF` where `WLS` is the default. See [WDT Domain Types](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling/blob/master/site/type_def.md).|\n+\n+Notes:\n+\n+ - There are additional attributes that are common to all domain home source types, such as the `image` field. See the Domain Resource [schema](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/blob/master/docs/domains/Domain.md) and [documentation]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-resource.md\" >}}) for a full list of domain resource fields.\n+\n+ - There are also additional fields that are specific to JRF domain types. For more information, see [Prerequisites for JRF domain types](#7-prerequisites-for-jrf-domain-types).\n+\n+ - Sample domain resource: For an example of a fully specified sample domain resource, see the the operator source's `kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image/k8s-domain.yaml.template` file for the [Model in Image]({{< relref \"/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) sample. Note that the `@@` entries in this template are not processed by the operator; they need to replaced with actual values before the resource can be applied.\n+\n+#### 7.

Skip it if your domain type is `WLS` or `RestrictedJRF`.\n+{{% /notice %}}\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database called an RCU database, initializing this database, and configuring your domain to access this database.

These items do not need to be created in order.\n+\n+#### 1. WebLogic operator\n+\n+Deploy a WebLogic operator and ensure that it is monitoring the desired namespace for your Model in Image domain. See [Manage operators]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-operators/_index.md\" >}}) and [Quick Start]({{< relref \"/quickstart/_index.md\" >}}).\n+\n+#### 2. WebLogic image\n+\n+Model in Image requires creating a 'final' deployable image that has WebLogic Server and WDT installed, plus your model and application files.\n+\n+You can start with a WebLogic 12.2.1.3 or later pre-built base image obtained from [Docker Hub](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/master/OracleWebLogic) or similar, manually build your own base image as per [Preparing a Base Image]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-in-image/base-images/_index.md\" >}}), or build a base image using the [WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool). Note that any 12.2.1.3 image must also include patch 29135930 (the pre-built images already contain this patch). For an example of the first approach for both WLS and JRF domains, see the [Model in Image]({{< relref \"/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) sample.\n+\n+After you have a base image, Model in Image requires layering the following directory structure for its (optional) WDT models artifacts and (required) WDT binaries:\n+\n+| Directory                | Contents                           | Extension   |\n+| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------- |\n+| `/u01/wdt/models`         | Optional domain model YAML files   | .yaml       |\n+| `/u01/wdt/models`         | Optional model variable files      | .properties |\n+| `/u01/wdt/models`         | Optional application archives      | .zip        |\n+| `/u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy`| Unzipped WebLogic deploy install   |             |\n+\n+There are two methods for layering Model in Image artifacts on top of a base image:\n+\n+  - **Manual Image Creation**: Use Docker commands to layer the WDT artifacts from the above table on top of your base image into a new image.\n+\n+  - **WebLogic Image Tool**: Use the convenient [WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool). The WebLogic Image Tool (WIT) has built-in options for embedding WDT model files, WDT binaries, WebLogic Server binaries, and WebLogic Server patches in an image. The [Model in Image]({{< relref \"/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) sample uses the WIT approach. For an example, see the sample's `build_image_model.sh` file in the operator source's `kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image` directory.\n+\n+For a discussion of model file syntax, see [Model files]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md\" >}}).\n+\n+#### 3. Optional WDT model config map\n+\n+You can create a WDT model config map that defines additional model `.yaml` and `.properties` files beyond what you've already supplied in your image, and then reference this config map using your domain resource's `configuration.model.configMap` attribute. This is optional if the supplied image already fully defines your model.\n+\n+WDT model config map files will be merged with the WDT files defined in your image at runtime before your domain home is created. The config map files can add to, remove from, or alter the model configuration that you supplied within your image.\n+\n+For example, place additional `.yaml` and `.properties` files in a directory called `/home/acmeuser/wdtoverride` and run the following commands:\n+\n+  ```\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    create configmap MY-DOMAINUID-my-wdt-config-map \\\n+    --from-file /home/acmeuser/wdtoverride\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    label  configmap MY-DOMAINUID-my-wdt-config-map \\\n+    weblogic.domainUID=MY-DOMAINUID\n+  ```\n+\n+See [Model files]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md\" >}}) for a discussion of model file syntax and loading order, and see [Runtime updates]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/runtime-updates.md\" >}}) for a discussion of using WDT model config maps to update the model configuration of a running domain.\n+\n+\n+#### 4. Required runtime encryption secret\n+\n+Model in Image requires a runtime encryption secret with a secure `password` key. This secret is used by the operator to encrypt model and domain home artifacts before it adds them to a runtime config map or log. The `password` that you set can safely change any time after you've fully shut down a domain but must remain the same for the life of a running domain. The runtime encryption secret that you create can be named anything but note that it is a best practice to name and label secrets with their domain UID to help ensure that cleanup scripts can find and delete them.\n+\n+**NOTE**: Because the runtime encryption password does not need to be shared and only needs to exist for the life of a domain, you may want to use a password generator.\n+\n+Example:\n+\n+  ```\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    create secret generic MY-DOMAINUID-runtime-encrypt-secret \\\n+    --from-literal=password=welcome1\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    label secret MY-DOMAINUID-runtime-encrypt-secret \\\n+    weblogic.domainUID=MY-DOMAINUID\n+  ```\n+\n+Corresponding domain resource snippet:\n+\n+  ```\n+  configuration:\n+    model:\n+      runtimeEncryptionSecret: MY-DOMAINUID-runtime-encrypt-secret\n+  ```\n+\n+#### 5. Secrets for model macros\n+\n+Create additional secrets as needed by macros in your model files. For example, these can store database URLs and credentials that are accessed using `@@SECRET` macros in your model that reference the secrets.  For a discussion of model macros, see [Model files]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md\" >}}).\n+\n+#### 6. Domain resource attributes\n+\n+The following domain resource attributes are specific to Model in Image domains.\n+\n+| Domain Resource Attribute                    |  Notes |\n+| -------------------------                    |  ------------------ |\n+| `domainHomeSourceType`                       |  Required.

Set this array if your image or config map models contain macros that reference custom Kubernetes secrets. For example, if your macros depend on secrets `my-secret` and `my-other-secret`, then set to `[my-secret, my-other-secret]`.|\n+| `configuration.model.RuntimeEncryptionSecret`| Required. All Model in Image domains must specify a runtime encryption secret. See [Required runtime encryption secret](#4-required-runtime-encryption-secret). |\n+| `configuration.model.domainType`             | Set the type of domain. Valid values are `WLS`, `JRF`, and `RestrictedJRF` where `WLS` is the default.

For an example of the first approach for both WLS and JRF domains, see the [Model in Image]({{< relref \"/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) sample.\n+\n+After you have a base image, Model in Image requires layering the following directory structure for its (optional) WDT models artifacts and (required) WDT binaries:\n+\n+| Directory                | Contents                           | Extension   |\n+| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------- |\n+| `/u01/wdt/models`         | Optional domain model YAML files   | .yaml       |\n+| `/u01/wdt/models`         | Optional model variable files      | .properties |\n+| `/u01/wdt/models`         | Optional application archives      | .zip        |\n+| `/u01/wdt/weblogic-deploy`| Unzipped WebLogic deploy install   |             |\n+\n+There are two methods for layering Model in Image artifacts on top of a base image:\n+\n+  - **Manual Image Creation**: Use Docker commands to layer the WDT artifacts from the above table on top of your base image into a new image.\n+\n+  - **WebLogic Image Tool**: Use the convenient [WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool). The WebLogic Image Tool (WIT) has built-in options for embedding WDT model files, WDT binaries, WebLogic Server binaries, and WebLogic Server patches in an image. The [Model in Image]({{< relref \"/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) sample uses the WIT approach. For an example, see the sample's `build_image_model.sh` file in the operator source's `kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image` directory.\n+\n+For a discussion of model file syntax, see [Model files]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md\" >}}).\n+\n+#### 3. Optional WDT model config map\n+\n+You can create a WDT model config map that defines additional model `.yaml` and `.properties` files beyond what you've already supplied in your image, and then reference this config map using your domain resource's `configuration.model.configMap` attribute. This is optional if the supplied image already fully defines your model.\n+\n+WDT model config map files will be merged with the WDT files defined in your image at runtime before your domain home is created. The config map files can add to, remove from, or alter the model configuration that you supplied within your image.\n+\n+For example, place additional `.yaml` and `.properties` files in a directory called `/home/acmeuser/wdtoverride` and run the following commands:\n+\n+  ```\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    create configmap MY-DOMAINUID-my-wdt-config-map \\\n+    --from-file /home/acmeuser/wdtoverride\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    label  configmap MY-DOMAINUID-my-wdt-config-map \\\n+    weblogic.domainUID=MY-DOMAINUID\n+  ```\n+\n+See [Model files]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md\" >}}) for a discussion of model file syntax and loading order, and see [Runtime updates]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/runtime-updates.md\" >}}) for a discussion of using WDT model config maps to update the model configuration of a running domain.\n+\n+\n+#### 4. Required runtime encryption secret\n+\n+Model in Image requires a runtime encryption secret with a secure `password` key. This secret is used by the operator to encrypt model and domain home artifacts before it adds them to a runtime config map or log. The `password` that you set can safely change any time after you've fully shut down a domain but must remain the same for the life of a running domain. The runtime encryption secret that you create can be named anything but note that it is a best practice to name and label secrets with their domain UID to help ensure that cleanup scripts can find and delete them.\n+\n+**NOTE**: Because the runtime encryption password does not need to be shared and only needs to exist for the life of a domain, you may want to use a password generator.\n+\n+Example:\n+\n+  ```\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    create secret generic MY-DOMAINUID-runtime-encrypt-secret \\\n+    --from-literal=password=welcome1\n+  kubectl -n MY-DOMAIN-NAMESPACE \\\n+    label secret MY-DOMAINUID-runtime-encrypt-secret \\\n+    weblogic.domainUID=MY-DOMAINUID\n+  ```\n+\n+Corresponding domain resource snippet:\n+\n+  ```\n+  configuration:\n+    model:\n+      runtimeEncryptionSecret: MY-DOMAINUID-runtime-encrypt-secret\n+  ```\n+\n+#### 5. Secrets for model macros\n+\n+Create additional secrets as needed by macros in your model files. For example, these can store database URLs and credentials that are accessed using `@@SECRET` macros in your model that reference the secrets.  For a discussion of model macros, see [Model files]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/model-files.md\" >}}).\n+\n+#### 6. Domain resource attributes\n+\n+The following domain resource attributes are specific to Model in Image domains.\n+\n+| Domain Resource Attribute                    |  Notes |\n+| -------------------------                    |  ------------------ |\n+| `domainHomeSourceType`                       |  Required. Set to `FromModel`. |\n+| `domainHome`                                 |  Must reference an empty or non-existent directory within your image. Do not include the mount path of any persistent volume. Note that Model in Image recreates the domain home for a WebLogic pod every time the pod restarts.|\n+| `configuration.model.configMap`             | Optional. Set if you have stored additional models in a config map as per [Optional WDT model config map](#3-optional-wdt-model-config-map). |\n+| `configuration.secrets`                      | Optional. Set this array if your image or config map models contain macros that reference custom Kubernetes secrets. For example, if your macros depend on secrets `my-secret` and `my-other-secret`, then set to `[my-secret, my-other-secret]`.|\n+| `configuration.model.RuntimeEncryptionSecret`| Required. All Model in Image domains must specify a runtime encryption secret. See [Required runtime encryption secret](#4-required-runtime-encryption-secret). |\n+| `configuration.model.domainType`             | Set the type of domain. Valid values are `WLS`, `JRF`, and `RestrictedJRF` where `WLS` is the default. See [WDT Domain Types](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling/blob/master/site/type_def.md).|\n+\n+Notes:\n+\n+ - There are additional attributes that are common to all domain home source types, such as the `image` field. See the Domain Resource [schema](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/blob/master/docs/domains/Domain.md) and [documentation]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/domain-resource.md\" >}}) for a full list of domain resource fields.\n+\n+ - There are also additional fields that are specific to JRF domain types. For more information, see [Prerequisites for JRF domain types](#7-prerequisites-for-jrf-domain-types).\n+\n+ - Sample domain resource: For an example of a fully specified sample domain resource, see the the operator source's `kubernetes/samples/scripts/create-weblogic-domain/model-in-image/k8s-domain.yaml.template` file for the [Model in Image]({{< relref \"/samples/simple/domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) sample. Note that the `@@` entries in this template are not processed by the operator; they need to replaced with actual values before the resource can be applied.\n+\n+#### 7. Prerequisites for JRF domain types\n+\n+{{% notice info %}} This section applies only for a `JRF` domain type. Skip it if your domain type is `WLS` or `RestrictedJRF`.\n+{{% /notice %}}\n+\n+A JRF domain requires an infrastructure database called an RCU database, initializing this database, and configuring your domain to access this database. All of these steps must occur before you first deploy your domain. When you first deploy your domain, the introspector job will initialize it's RCU schema tables in the database - a process that can take several minutes.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id":
