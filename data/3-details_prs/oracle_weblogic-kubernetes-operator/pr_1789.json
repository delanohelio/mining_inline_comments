For each cluster, the operator will sort cluster member Managed Server names from the WebLogic domain configuration by normalizing any numbers in the Managed Server name and then sorting alphabetically. This is done so that server names such as \"managed-server10\" come after \"managed-server9\". The operator will then start Managed Servers from the sorted list, up to the `replicas` count, unless specific Managed Servers are specified as starting in their entry under the `managedServers` field. In that case, the specified Managed Servers will be started and then additional cluster members will be started, up to the `replicas` count, by finding further cluster members in the sorted list that are not already started. If cluster members are started because of their entries under `managedServers`, then a cluster may have more cluster members running than its `replicas` count. Defaults to 0.\n+* `maxClusterConcurrentStartup`: The maximum number of cluster member Managed Server instances that the operator will start in parallel for a given cluster, if `maxConcurrentStartup` is not specified for a specific cluster under the `clusters` field.

Repeating introspection is required for the operator to recognize changes to the domain configuration, such as adding a new WebLogic cluster or Managed Server instance, to regenerate configuration overrides, or to regenerate the WebLogic domain home when the `domainHomeSourceType` is FromModel. Introspection occurs automatically, without requiring change to this field, when servers are first started or restarted after a full domain shutdown. For the FromModel `domainHomeSourceType`, introspection also occurs when a running server must be restarted because of changes to any of the fields [listed here](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/userguide/managing-domains/domain-lifecycle/startup/#properties-that-cause-servers-to-be-restarted).

Legal values are DYNAMIC, which means that the operator will distribute updated configuration overrides dynamically to running servers, and ON_RESTART, which means that servers will use updated configuration overrides only after the server's next restart. The selection of ON_RESTART will not cause servers to restart when there are updated configuration overrides available. See also `introspectVersion`.

Default is `WLS`.\n-  * `runtimeEncryptionSecret`: Required. Expected field is `password`. This is used by Model in Image to encrypt data while the data is passed from the introspector job to WebLogic pods. The password can be arbitrary: the only requirement is that it must stay the same for the life of a domain resource. If a domain resource is deleted then redeployed, it's fine to change the password during the interim.\n-  * `wdtEncryptionSecret`: Optional. Rarely used. See [Model in Image]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/model-in-image/_index.md\" >}}) for details.\n+  * `configMap`: Name of a ConfigMap containing the WebLogic Deploy Tooling model.\n+  * `domainType`: WebLogic Deploy Tooling domain type.

The values directly under `spec`, set the defaults for the entire domain.  The values under a specific entry under `clusters`, set the defaults for cluster members of that cluster.  The values under `adminServer` or an entry under `managedServers`, set the values for that specific server.  Values from the domain scope and values from the cluster (for cluster members) are merged with or overridden by the setting for the specific server depending on the element.

To recover from a failed state, correct the underlying problem and update the `introspectVersion`.\n+\n+### Introspection use cases\n+\n+#### Adding clusters or Managed Servers to the WebLogic domain configuration\n+\n+When you have an existing WebLogic domain home on a persistent volume (\"Domain in PV\") and you currently have WebLogic Server instances running, it is now possible to define new WebLogic clusters or Managed Servers in the domain configuration and start these new instances without affecting the life cycle of any WebLogic Server instances that are already running.\n+\n+Prior to operator 3.0.0, this was not possible because there was no mechanism to initiate introspection other than a full domain shut down and restart and so the operator was unaware of the new clusters or Managed Servers. Now, after updating the domain configuration, you can initiate introspection by changing the `introspectVersion`.\n+\n+For instance, if you had a domain configuration with a single cluster named \"cluster-1\" then your Domain YAML file may have content like this:\n+\n+```\n+spec:\n+  ...\n+  clusters:\n+    - clusterName: cluster-1\n+      replicas: 3\n+  ...\n+```\n+\n+If you modified your WebLogic domain configuration (using the console or WLST) to add a new dynamic cluster named \"cluster-2\", then you could immediately start cluster members of this new cluster by updating your Domain YAML file like this:\n+\n+```\n+spec:\n+  ...\n+  clusters:\n+    - clusterName: cluster-1\n+      replicas: 3\n+    - clusterName: cluster-2\n+      replicas: 2\n+  introspectVersion: \"2\"\n+  ...\n+```\n+\n+When this updated Domain YAML file is applied, the operator will initiate a new introspection of the domain configuration during which it will learn about the additional WebLogic cluster and then the operator will continue to start WebLogic Server instances that are members of this new cluster. In this case, the operator will start two Managed Servers that are members of the cluster named \"cluster-2\".\n+\n+#### Distributing changes to configuration overrides\n+\n+The operator supports customer-provided [configuration overrides]({{<relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/configoverrides/_index.md\">}}). These configuration overrides, which are supported with Domain in PV or Domain in Image, allow you to override elements of the domain configuration, such as data source URL's or credentials.\n+\n+With operator 3.0.0, you can now change the configuration overrides and distribute these new configuration overrides to already running WebLogic Server instances. To do this, update the ConfigMap that contains the configuration overrides or update one or more of the Secrets referenced by those configuration overrides and then initiate introspection by changing the `introspectVersion` field.\n+\n+We have introduced a new field, called `overrideDistributionStrategy` and located under `configuration`, that controls whether updated configuration overrides are distributed dynamically to already running WebLogic Server instances or if the new configuration overrides are only applied when servers are started or restarted.\n+\n+The default value for `overrideDistributionStrategy` is DYNAMIC, which means that new configuration overrides are distributed dynamically to already running WebLogic Server instances. \n+\n+Alternately, you can set `overrideDistributionStrategy` to ON_RESTART, which means that the new configuration overrides will not be distributed to already running WebLogic Server instances, but will instead be applied only to servers as they start or restart. Use of this value will *not* cause WebLogic Server instances to restart absent changes to other fields, such as `restartVersion`.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "bd8f602f1e39cd50131b75d3315f0d5d3c17e2cc"}, "originalPosition": 98}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDQ1Nzc2NzE4", "url": "https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/pull/1789#pullrequestreview-445776718", "createdAt": "2020-07-09T16:24:23Z", "commit": {"oid": "bd8f602f1e39cd50131b75d3315f0d5d3c17e2cc"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNy0wOVQxNjoyNDoyNlrOGvYoaA==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNy0wOVQxNjoyNDoyNlrOGvYoaA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ1MjMzOTgxNg==", "bodyText": "Consider working in a mention that the job is named DOMAIN_UID-introspect-domain-job and that it runs in the same namespace as the Domain.", "url": "https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/pull/1789#discussion_r452339816", "createdAt": "2020-07-09T16:24:26Z", "author": {"login": "tbarnes-us"}, "path": "docs-source/content/userguide/managing-domains/domain-lifecycle/introspection.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,98 @@\n+---\n+title: \"Domain introspection\"\n+date: 2020-07-07T08:14:51-05:00\n+draft: true\n+weight: 5\n+description: \"This document describes domain introspection in the Oracle WebLogic Server in Kubernetes environment.\"\n+---\n+\n+\n+This document describes domain introspection, when it occurs automatically, and how and when to trigger additional introspections of the domain configuration in the Oracle WebLogic Server in Kubernetes environment.\n+\n+In order to manage the operation of WebLogic domains in Kubernetes, the Oracle WebLogic Kubernetes Operator analyzes the WebLogic\n+domain configuration using an \"introspection\" job.

For each cluster, the operator will sort cluster member Managed Server names from the WebLogic domain configuration by normalizing any numbers in the Managed Server name and then sorting alphabetically. This is done so that server names such as \"managed-server10\" come after \"managed-server9\". The operator will then start Managed Servers from the sorted list, up to the `replicas` count, unless specific Managed Servers are specified as starting in their entry under the `managedServers` field. In that case, the specified Managed Servers will be started and then additional cluster members will be started, up to the `replicas` count, by finding further cluster members in the sorted list that are not already started. If cluster members are started because of their entries under `managedServers`, then a cluster may have more cluster members running than its `replicas` count.

Repeating introspection is required for the operator to recognize changes to the domain configuration, such as adding a new WebLogic cluster or Managed Server instance, to regenerate configuration overrides, or to regenerate the WebLogic domain home when the `domainHomeSourceType` is FromModel. Introspection occurs automatically, without requiring change to this field, when servers are first started or restarted after a full domain shut down. For the FromModel `domainHomeSourceType`, introspection also occurs when a running server must be restarted because of changes to any of the fields [listed here](https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/userguide/managing-domains/domain-lifecycle/startup/#properties-that-cause-servers-to-be-restarted).

Configuration overrides are generated during introspection from Secrets, the `overrideConfigMap` field, and WebLogic domain topology. Legal values are DYNAMIC, which means that the operator will distribute updated configuration overrides dynamically to running servers, and ON_RESTART, which means that servers will use updated configuration overrides only after the server's next restart. The selection of ON_RESTART will not cause servers to restart when there are updated configuration overrides available. See also `introspectVersion`. Defaults to DYNAMIC.\n+  * `secrets`: A list of names of the Secrets for WebLogic [configuration overrides]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-domains/configoverrides/_index.md\" >}}) or model.
