Before installing the operator, create the namespace in which you want to run the domain and label it.\n+\n+```\n+$ kubectl create namespace weblogic-operator\n+$ kubectl label namespace weblogic-operator istio-injection=enabled\n+```\n+\n+After the namespace is labeled, you can [install the operator]({{< relref \"/userguide/managing-operators/installation/_index.md\" >}}).  \n+When the operator pod starts, you will notice that Istio automatically injects an `initContainer` called `istio-init` \n+and the envoy container `istio-proxy`.\n+\n+You can validate this using the following commands:\n+\n+```\n+$ kubectl --namespace weblogic-operator get pods\n+$ kubectl --namespace weblogic-operator get pod weblogic-operator-xxx-xxx -o yaml\n+```\n+\n+In the second command, change `weblogic-operator-xxx-xxx` to the name of your pod.\n+\n+#### Creating a domain with Istio support\n+\n+You can configure your domains to run with Istio automatic sidecar injection enabled.\n+Before creating your domain, create the namespace in which you want to run the operator\n+and label it for automatic injection.\n+\n+```\n+$ kubectl create namespace domain1\n+$ kubectl label namespace domain1 istio-injection=enabled\n+```\n+\n+To enable Istio support for a domain, you need to add the\n+`configuration` section to your domain custom resource YAML file as shown in the\n+following example:  \n+\n+```\n+apiVersion: \"weblogic.oracle/v7\"\n+kind: Domain\n+metadata:\n+  name: domain2\n+  namespace: domain1\n+  labels:\n+    weblogic.resourceVersion: domain-v2\n+    weblogic.domainUID: domain2\n+spec:\n+  ... other content ...\n+  configuration:\n+    istio:\n+      enabled: true\n+      readinessPort: 8888\n+```\n+\n+To enable Istio support, you must include the `istio` section\n+and you must set `enabled: true` as shown.  The `readinessPort` is optional\n+and defaults to `8888` if not provided; it is used for readiness health check.\n+\n+##### How Istio-enabled domains differ from regular domains\n+\n+Istio enforces a number of requirements on Pods.  When you enable Istio support in the domain resource, the\n+introspector job automatically creates configuration overrides with the necessary channels for the domain to satisfy Istio's requirements, including:\n+\n+When deploying a domain with Istio sidecar injection enabled, the WebLogic Server Kubernetes Operator automatically adds the following network\n+channels using configuration overrides.\n+\n+https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/configuration/traffic-management/protocol-selection/\n+\n+For non-SSL traffic:\n+\n+|Name|Port|Protocol|Exposed as a container port|\n+|----|----|--------|-----|\n+|`http-probe`|`From configuration istio readinessPort`|`http`|`N`|\n+|`tcp-default`|`Server listening port`|`t3`|`Y`|\n+|`http-default`|`Server listening port`|`http`|`Y`|\n+|`tcp-snmp`|`Server listening port`|`snmp`|`Y`|\n+|`tcp-cbt`|`server listening port`|`CLUSTER-BROADCAST`|`N`|\n+|`tcp-iiop`|`server listening port`|`http`|`N`|\n+\n+For SSL traffic, if SSL is enabled on the server:\n+\n+|Name|Port|Protocol|Exposed as a container port|\n+|----|----|--------|-----|\n+|`tls-default`|`Server SSL listening port`|`t3s`|`Y`|\n+|`https-secure`|`Server SSL listening port`|`https`|`Y`|\n+|`tls-iiops`|`Server SSL listening port`|`iiops`|`N`|\n+|`tls-ldaps`|`Server SSL listening port`|`ldaps`|`N`|\n+|`tls-cbts`|`Server listening port`|`CLUSTER-BROADCAST-SECURE`|`N`|\n+\n+If WebLogic Administration Port is enabled on the Administration Server:\n+\n+|Name|Port|Protocol|Exposed in the container port|\n+|----|----|--------|-----|\n+|`https-admin`|`WebLogic administration port`|`https`|`Y`|\n+\n+\n+Additionally, when Istio support is enabled for a domain, the operator\n+ensures that the Istio sidecar is not injected into the introspector job's pods.\n+\n+\n+### Apply the domain resource yaml\n+\n+After the domain resource YAML file is modified, apply it by:\n+\n+```\n+kubect apply -f domain.yaml\n+```\n+\n+After all the servers are up, you will see output like this:\n+\n+```\n+kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns get pods\n+\n+NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\n+sample-domain1-admin-server      2/2     Running   0          154m\n+sample-domain1-managed-server1   2/2     Running   0          153m\n+sample-domain1-managed-server2   2/2     Running   0          153m\n+\n+```\n+\n+If you use `istioctl proxy-status`, you will see the mesh status:\n+\n+```\n+istioctl proxy-status \n+NAME                                                               CDS        LDS        EDS        RDS          PILOT                            VERSION\n+istio-ingressgateway-5c7d8d7b5d-tjgtd.istio-system                 SYNCED     SYNCED     SYNCED     NOT SENT     istio-pilot-6cfcdb75dd-87lqm     1.5.4\n+sample-domain1-admin-server.sample-domain1-ns                      SYNCED     SYNCED     SYNCED     SYNCED       istio-pilot-6cfcdb75dd-87lqm     1.5.4\n+sample-domain1-managed-server1.sample-domain1-ns                   SYNCED     SYNCED     SYNCED     SYNCED       istio-pilot-6cfcdb75dd-87lqm     1.5.4\n+sample-domain1-managed-server2.sample-domain1-ns                   SYNCED     SYNCED     SYNCED     SYNCED       istio-pilot-6cfcdb75dd-87lqm     1.5.4\n+weblogic-operator-7d86fffbdd-5dxzt.sample-weblogic-operator-ns     SYNCED     SYNCED     SYNCED     SYNCED       istio-pilot-6cfcdb75dd-87lqm     1.5.4\n+\n+```\n+\n+#### Exposing applications in Istio-enabled domains\n+\n+When a domain is running with Istio support, you should use the Istio\n+gateway to provide external access to applications, instead of using an ingress\n+controller like Traefik.  Using the Istio gateway will enable you to view the\n+traffic in Kiali and to use distributed tracing all the way from the entry point to\n+the cluster, for example, the Istio gateway.\n+\n+To configure external access to your domain, you need to create an Istio `Gateway` and\n+`Virtualservice` as shown in the example below:\n+\n+```\n+---\n+apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3\n+kind:

The WebLogic Server Kubernetes Operator automatically add the following network\n+channels via configuration overrides.\n+\n+https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/configuration/traffic-management/protocol-selection/\n+\n+For non-SSL traffic:\n+\n+|Name|Port|Protocol|Exposed as a container port|\n+|----|----|--------|-----|\n+|http-probe|From configuration istio readinessPort|http|N|\n+|tcp-default|server listening port|t3|Y|\n+|http-default|server listening port|http|Y|\n+|tcp-snmp|server listening port|snmp|Y|\n+|tcp-cbt|server listening port|CLUSTER-BROADCAST|N|\n+|tcp-iiop|server listening port|http|N|\n+\n+For SSL traffic, if SSL is enabled on the server:\n+\n+|Name|Port|Protocol|Exposed as a container port|\n+|----|----|--------|-----|\n+|tls-default|server SSL listening port|t3s|Y|\n+|https-secure|server SSL listening port|https|Y|\n+|tls-iiops|server SSL listening port|iiops|N|\n+|tls-ldaps|server SSL listening port|ldaps|N|\n+|tls-cbts|server listening port|CLUSTER-BROADCAST-SECURE|N|\n+\n+If WebLogic Administration Port is enabled on the Administration Server:\n+\n+|Name|Port|Protocol|Exposed in the container port|\n+|----|----|--------|-----|\n+|htps-admin|WebLogic Administration Port|https|Y|\n+\n+\n+Additionally, when Istio support is enabled for a domain, the operator\n+ensures that the Istio sidecar is not injected into the introspector job's pods.\n+\n+\n+### Apply the domain resource yaml\n+\n+After the domain resource YAML is modified, apply it by\n+\n+```\n+kubect apply -f domain.yaml\n+```\n+\n+After all the servers are up, you will see output like this:\n+\n+```\n+kubectl -n sample-domain1-ns get pods\n+\n+NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\n+sample-domain1-admin-server      2/2     Running   0          154m\n+sample-domain1-managed-server1   2/2     Running   0          153m\n+sample-domain1-managed-server2   2/2     Running   0          153m\n+\n+```\n+\n+If you use `istioctl proxy-status`, you will see the mesh status:\n+\n+```\n+istioctl proxy-status \n+NAME                                                               CDS        LDS        EDS        RDS          PILOT                            VERSION\n+istio-ingressgateway-5c7d8d7b5d-tjgtd.istio-system                 SYNCED     SYNCED     SYNCED     NOT SENT     istio-pilot-6cfcdb75dd-87lqm     1.5.4\n+sample-domain1-admin-server.sample-domain1-ns                      SYNCED     SYNCED     SYNCED     SYNCED       istio-pilot-6cfcdb75dd-87lqm     1.5.4\n+sample-domain1-managed-server1.sample-domain1-ns                   SYNCED     SYNCED     SYNCED     SYNCED       istio-pilot-6cfcdb75dd-87lqm     1.5.4\n+sample-domain1-managed-server2.sample-domain1-ns                   SYNCED     SYNCED     SYNCED     SYNCED       istio-pilot-6cfcdb75dd-87lqm     1.5.4\n+weblogic-operator-7d86fffbdd-5dxzt.sample-weblogic-operator-ns     SYNCED     SYNCED     SYNCED     SYNCED       istio-pilot-6cfcdb75dd-87lqm     1.5.4\n+\n+```\n+\n+#### Exposing applications in Istio-enabled domains\n+\n+When a domain is running with Istio support, you should use the Istio\n+gateway to provide external access to applications, instead of using an ingress\n+controller like Traefik.  Using the Istio gateway will enable you to view the\n+traffic in Kiali and to use distributed tracing all the way from the entry point to\n+the cluster, for example, the Istio gateway.\n+\n+To configure external access to your domain, you need to create an Istio `Gateway` and\n+`Virtualservice` as shown in the example below:\n+\n+```\n+---\n+apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3\n+kind: Gateway\n+metadata:\n+  name: domain1-gateway\n+  namespace: domain1\n+spec:\n+  selector:\n+    istio: ingressgateway\n+  servers:\n+    - hosts:\n+        - '*'\n+      port:\n+        name: http\n+        number: 80\n+        protocol: HTTP\n+---\n+apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3\n+kind: VirtualService\n+metadata:\n+  name: domain1-virtualservice\n+  namespace: domain1\n+spec:\n+  gateways:\n+    - domain1-gateway\n+  hosts:\n+    - '*'\n+  http:\n+    - match:\n+        - uri:\n+            prefix: /console\n+        - port: 7001\n+      route:\n+        - destination:\n+            host: sample-domain1-admin-server.sample-domain1-ns.svc.cluster.local\n+            port:\n+              number: 7001\n+    - match:\n+        - uri:\n+            prefix: /testwebapp\n+        - port: 8001\n+      route:\n+        - destination:\n+            host: sample-domain1-cluster-cluster-1.domain1.svc.cluster.local\n+            port:\n+              number: 8001\n+```\n+\n+This example creates a gateway that will accept requests with any host name\n+using HTTP on port 80, and a virtual service that will route all of\n+those requests to the cluster service for `cluster-1` in `domain1` in\n+the namespace `domain1`.\n+\n+Once the gateway and virtual service has been setup, you can access it through your ingress host and port, \n+refer to [Determining the ingress IP and ports](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/getting-started/#determining-the-ingress-ip-and-ports)\n+\n+\n+For more information about providing ingress using Istio, refer to the [Istio documentation](https://istio.io/docs/tasks/traffic-management/ingress/).\n+\n+#### Traffic management\n+\n+Istio provides traffic management capabilities, including the ability to\n+visualize traffic in Kiali.  You do not need to change your applications to use\n+this feature.  The Istio proxy (envoy) sidecar that is injected into your pods\n+provides this visibility. The Istio support enables\n+traffic management.
