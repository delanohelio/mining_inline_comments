This could be the case when the WebLogic Server instance is booting or about to boot.\n+\n+#### Readiness probe customization\n+\n+The readiness probe is by default configured to use the WebLogic Server ReadyApp framework. The ReadyApp framework allows fine customization of the readiness probe by application's participation in the framework. See [Using the ReadyApp Framework](https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/fusion-middleware/weblogic-server/12.2.1.4/depgd/managing.html#GUID-C98443B1-D368-4CA4-A7A4-97B86FFD3C28) for more details. The readiness probe is used to determine if the server is ready to accept user requests. The readiness is used to determine when a server should be included in a load balancer's endpoints, when a restarted server is fully started in the case of a rolling restart, and for various other purposes.\n+\n+The readiness probe is by default configured to check readiness every 5 seconds, and to timeout after 5 seconds.  The readiness probe interval and timeout can be customized using the `readinessProbe` attribute under the `serverPod` element of the domain resource.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "8ba1c9a1d1737791d846454325e61b93c7882f89"}, "originalPosition": 83}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMzMwOTUyMTYzOnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "docs-source/content/userguide/managing-domains/domain-resource.md", "isResolved": false, "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0yMFQxNjo0Nzo1OFrOH3Xpbg==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0yMFQxNjo0Nzo1OFrOH3Xpbg==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyNzgyMTE2Ng==", "bodyText": "to customization -> to the customization\nprobe -> probes", "url": "https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/pull/2055#discussion_r527821166", "createdAt": "2020-11-20T16:47:58Z", "author": {"login": "rosemarymarano"}, "path": "docs-source/content/userguide/managing-domains/domain-resource.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -201,6 +201,9 @@ Sub-sections related to the Administration Server, specific clusters, or specifi\n \n The elements `serverStartPolicy`, `serverStartState`, `serverPod` and `serverService` are repeated under `adminServer` and under each entry of `clusters` or `managedServers`.
