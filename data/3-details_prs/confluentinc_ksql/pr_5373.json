Inter-node communication will\n+use the same listener as client communication.\n+\n+#### Single non-routable listener\n \n-### Listener Uses a Special or Unroutable Address\n+It's common to setup a service using special hostnames such as `localhost` or wildcard addresses\n+such as `0.0.0.0` or `[::]`.
