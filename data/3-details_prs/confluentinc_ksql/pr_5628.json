Rather, perform an action asynchronously on each new row as it arrives\n+- Block until the next row arrives\n+- Block until all rows have arrived. This only makes sense in the context of pull queries and push queries with `LIMIT` clauses. \n+\n+Details of client interfaces to support these methods will likely vary by language. For example, the [Java client](java-client.md)\n+uses [Reactive Streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org/) for its asynchronous streaming interface. \n+\n+### Terminating push queries ###\n+\n+Requests to terminate push queries should be sent to the [`/close-query` server endpoint](TODO).\n+The client should expose an interface that allows users to pass in a push query ID to be passed to this endpoint.\n+\n+### Inserting new rows of data into existing ksqlDB streams ###\n+\n+ksqlDB supports inserting new rows of data into existing ksqlDB streams via the [`/inserts-stream` server endpoint](TODO).\n+If the server successfully validates the target stream name from a request made to the `/inserts-stream` endpoint,\n+the client may then write JSON-serialized rows of data to the connection, and the server will insert each\n+asynchronously and write an ack containing the relevant sequence number to the response.\n+\n+Because the insertions happen asynchronously on the server side, it makes sense for the client to expose APIs\n+for inserting one row at a time, but inserting batches of rows is less useful due to the lack of transactional guarantees.\n+\n+The client should provide a convenient way for users to create rows of data to insert.\n+The Java client's [KsqlObject](TODO) is one example, though details will likely vary by language.\n+\n+### Creation of new streams, tables, and persistent queries ###\n+\n+These DDL/DML requests should be sent to the [`/ksql` server endpoint](../ksqldb-rest-api/ksql-endpoint.md).\n+\n+### Terminating persistent queries ###\n+\n+These requests should be sent to the [`/ksql` server endpoint](../ksqldb-rest-api/ksql-endpoint.md).\n+\n+### Listing existing streams, tables, topics, and queries ###\n+\n+These admin operation requests should be sent to the [`/ksql` server endpoint](../ksqldb-rest-api/ksql-endpoint.md).\n+\n+Configurations\n+--------------\n+\n+The client of course needs to expose options for specifying the address of the ksqlDB server to connect to.\n+Additional options important to expose include: \n+- Support for TLS-enabled ksqlDB servers\n+- Support for mutual-TLS-enabled ksqlDB servers\n+- Support for ksqlDB servers with HTTP basic authentication enabled\n+\n+It may also be nice to support configuring multiple ksqlDB server addresses, so the client may route requests\n+to a different server if one is down.\n+\n+Process\n+-------\n+\n+Thanks for your interest in contributing a client!", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0MTE2NTE1NQ=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "1b606009264ea6164395bba093fb39daf8e4b52a"}, "originalPosition": 105}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDYwODU5MzQw", "url": "https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/pull/5628#pullrequestreview-460859340", "createdAt": "2020-08-04T14:19:48Z", "commit": {"oid": "eab6c70e3c25dc6a3614a3152e3cc954f5f4a134"}, "state": "APPROVED", "comments": {"totalCount": 0, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": null, "endCursor": null, "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": []}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "981a18350e59ba70a652e51f6f43acd57810481f", "author": {"user": {"login": "vcrfxia", "name": "Victoria Xia"}}, "url": "https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/commit/981a18350e59ba70a652e51f6f43acd57810481f", "committedDate": "2020-08-19T18:39:06Z", "message": "Merge branch 'master' into client-contribution-docs"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "bd2bf8134abde786fd54f3524c2d05054d7b20b6", "author": {"user": {"login": "vcrfxia", "name": "Victoria Xia"}}, "url": "https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/commit/bd2bf8134abde786fd54f3524c2d05054d7b20b6", "committedDate": "2020-08-19T19:18:56Z", "message": "chore: more feedback"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDcyMzcxNzU1", "url": "https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/pull/5628#pullrequestreview-472371755", "createdAt": "2020-08-21T10:12:23Z", "commit": {"oid": "bd2bf8134abde786fd54f3524c2d05054d7b20b6"}, "state": "APPROVED", "comments": {"totalCount": 0, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": null, "endCursor": null, "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": []}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 213, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-01T13:07:16Z"}}}
