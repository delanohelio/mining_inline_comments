Syntax\n+\n+#### New syntax decision\n+\n+ksqlDB has a syntax to SET server and CLI properties. The use is `SET` for server properties, and `SET CLI` for CLI settings.\n+\n+For instance:\n+```\n+ksql> SET 'auto.offset.reset' = 'earliest';\n+ksql> SET CLI WRAP OFF;\n+```\n+\n+The quickest assumption is that we can use `SET` for user variables as well. But, we cannot re-use any of the above syntax because\n+of conflicts with current server and CLI setting names. So a new keyword must be use.\n+\n+Some ideas:\n+```\n+SET LOCAL   var1 = 'val1';\n+SET SESSION var1 = 'val1';\n+SET VAR     var1 = 'val1';\n+```\n+\n+`LOCAL` is confusing for users coming from other DBs environments. `LOCAL` is used to keep the scope on per-transaction basis. After a statement\n+is executed, the variable is destroyed.\n+\n+`SESSION` may be also confusing. `SESSION` is used on other DBs to override system variables for that session only. System variables are like ksqlDB\n+server properties.\n+\n+`VAR` seems a better name.\n+\n+However, we're now overloading the use of `SET` statements. For instance, in the future, we might want to use `SET ROLE`  to set the current role\n+fo the user when interacting with an RBAC server. But, if we want to print variable information, how would we do it?\n+```\n+SET VAR var1;  # prints var1 name\n+SET VAR;       # lists all variables\n+SET;           # what to do? lists all server, cli, variables, etc?\n+```\n+\n+Also, the use of single-quotes in `SET` server settings is tedious to type. So after removing them, we'll have two different sets:\n+* `SET 'server_property' = 'server_value'`\n+* `SET VAR variable = `variable_value'\n+\n+This looks confusing too. So we have to decide for a new syntax for substitution variables.\n+\n+Other DBs use different syntax to create user variables (DECLARE, DEFINE, \\set, SET). For ksqlDB, I'll choose to use `DEFINE` and `UNDEFINE` which\n+is what Oracle SQL*plus uses. Any user coming from this DB will immediately understand the command.  \n+This is opened to discussion, but will continue with this for now.\n+\n+#### Creating and printing substitution variables\n+\n+The command to interact with substitution variables is `DEFINE`.  \n+`DEFINE` will allow us to define a new variable, print the variable value and list all current defined variables.\n+\n+Syntax:\n+```\n+DEFINE [name [= 'value']];\n+\n+Where: \n+  name     is the variable name to define\n+  value    is the variable value\n+```\n+Valid variables names start with a letter or underscore (\\_) followed by zero or more alphanumeric characters or underscores.\n+\n+All variable values need to be wrapped using single quotes. All variables are stored as string values in memory, and when\n+replaced, the value without the quotes will be used. ksqlDB parsing will be in charge of determining the format at that\n+time.\n+\n+The reason not to remove single-quotes from values is to allow spaces, and to leave the syntax open for using data types in the future if required.  \n+Also, having decide the format at run-time (i.e. `define n = 3.34238`) is tricky as we could lose precision in case of decimals. Better stay with Strings for now.\n+\n+Define a new variable:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE replicas = '3';\n+ksql> DEFINE partitions = '5';\n+```\n+\n+Print a defined variable value:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE replicas;\n+DEFINE replicas   = '3'\n+```\n+\n+List all defined variables:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE;\n+DEFINE replicas   = '3'\n+DEFINE partitions = '5'\n+```\n+\n+#### Deleting substitution variables\n+\n+The `UNDEFINE` command deletes the variable.\n+\n+Syntax:\n+```\n+UNDEFINE name;\n+```\n+\n+### 2. Scope\n+\n+All variables will live during the session of a ksqlDB connection, then destroyed when the connection is closed. Only the user\n+in that session can interact with the defined substitution variables. No other users can interact with other users' variables.\n+\n+In CLI, the session is opened when starting the CLI with the `ksql` command, and destroyed when typing `exit`.\n+\n+In headless, the session is opened when starting the ksqlDB server with a SQL script. The variables stay alive until the server is\n+killed.\n+\n+Variables are not persisted anywhere. They are living in memory as long as the session is not terminated.\n+\n+#### RUN SCRIPT command\n+\n+If a `RUN SCRIPT` command is executed in a CLI session, then any variable defined there will be local to the execution context of the\n+script. The variables will override any variable previously defined in the session. When the script is completed, all local variables\n+defined will be destroyed. This ensures users do not override their session variables by accident when running `RUN SCRIPT` commands.\n+\n+#### The SOURCE command\n+\n+To allow users load variables and keep their scope in the session, then the new `SOURCE` command will be added. This will override\n+any previously defined variables, and will be destroyed until the user leaves the session.\n+\n+Syntax:\n+```\n+SOURCE '<script_file>';\n+```\n+\n+The `SOURCE` command will work like a `RUN SCRIPT`. If other SQL statements are in the file, then those statements will also be\n+executed, thus to avoid limiting users from using DDL/DML commands while defining variables at the same time from one single script.\n+\n+`SOURCE` will be used only on the CLI and headless mode. REST API will not accept it because files may be out of the scope of the server filesystem.\n+\n+### 3. Referencing substitution variables\n+\n+Variables will be referenced by wrapping the variable between `{}` characters (i.e. `{replicas}`). These characters are also used by\n+QTT (or ksqlDB functional tests) to replace variables. It's better to keep the same format between testing and production to avoid\n+confusion.\n+\n+Example:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE format = 'AVRO';\n+ksql> DEFINE replicas = '3';\n+ksql> CREATE STREAM stream1 (id INT) WITH (kafka_topic='stream1', value_format='{format}', replicas={replicas});\n+```\n+\n+Substitution will not attempt to add single-quotes to the values. Users will need to know the data type to use when using a variable. The ksqlDB\n+server will be in charge of parsing and failing if the type is not allowed.\n+\n+Note: Variables are not case sensitive.

Syntax\n+\n+#### New syntax decision\n+\n+ksqlDB has a syntax to SET server and CLI properties. The use is `SET` for server properties, and `SET CLI` for CLI settings.\n+\n+For instance:\n+```\n+ksql> SET 'auto.offset.reset' = 'earliest';\n+ksql> SET CLI WRAP OFF;\n+```\n+\n+The quickest assumption is that we can use `SET` for user variables as well. But, we cannot re-use any of the above syntax because\n+of conflicts with current server and CLI setting names. So a new keyword must be use.\n+\n+Some ideas:\n+```\n+SET LOCAL   var1 = 'val1';\n+SET SESSION var1 = 'val1';\n+SET VAR     var1 = 'val1';\n+```\n+\n+`LOCAL` is confusing for users coming from other DBs environments. `LOCAL` is used to keep the scope on per-transaction basis. After a statement\n+is executed, the variable is destroyed.\n+\n+`SESSION` may be also confusing. `SESSION` is used on other DBs to override system variables for that session only. System variables are like ksqlDB\n+server properties.\n+\n+`VAR` seems a better name.\n+\n+However, we're now overloading the use of `SET` statements. For instance, in the future, we might want to use `SET ROLE`  to set the current role\n+fo the user when interacting with an RBAC server. But, if we want to print variable information, how would we do it?\n+```\n+SET VAR var1;  # prints var1 name\n+SET VAR;       # lists all variables\n+SET;           # what to do? lists all server, cli, variables, etc?\n+```\n+\n+Also, the use of single-quotes in `SET` server settings is tedious to type. So after removing them, we'll have two different sets:\n+* `SET 'server_property' = 'server_value'`\n+* `SET VAR variable = `variable_value'\n+\n+This looks confusing too. So we have to decide for a new syntax for substitution variables.\n+\n+Other DBs use different syntax to create user variables (DECLARE, DEFINE, \\set, SET). For ksqlDB, I'll choose to use `DEFINE` and `UNDEFINE` which\n+is what Oracle SQL*plus uses. Any user coming from this DB will immediately understand the command.  \n+This is opened to discussion, but will continue with this for now.\n+\n+#### Creating and printing substitution variables\n+\n+The command to interact with substitution variables is `DEFINE`.  \n+`DEFINE` will allow us to define a new variable, print the variable value and list all current defined variables.\n+\n+Syntax:\n+```\n+DEFINE [name [= 'value']];\n+\n+Where: \n+  name     is the variable name to define\n+  value    is the variable value\n+```\n+Valid variables names start with a letter or underscore (\\_) followed by zero or more alphanumeric characters or underscores.\n+\n+All variable values need to be wrapped using single quotes. All variables are stored as string values in memory, and when\n+replaced, the value without the quotes will be used. ksqlDB parsing will be in charge of determining the format at that\n+time.\n+\n+The reason not to remove single-quotes from values is to allow spaces, and to leave the syntax open for using data types in the future if required.  \n+Also, having decide the format at run-time (i.e. `define n = 3.34238`) is tricky as we could lose precision in case of decimals. Better stay with Strings for now.\n+\n+Define a new variable:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE replicas = '3';\n+ksql> DEFINE partitions = '5';\n+```\n+\n+Print a defined variable value:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE replicas;\n+DEFINE replicas   = '3'\n+```\n+\n+List all defined variables:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE;\n+DEFINE replicas   = '3'\n+DEFINE partitions = '5'\n+```\n+\n+#### Deleting substitution variables\n+\n+The `UNDEFINE` command deletes the variable.\n+\n+Syntax:\n+```\n+UNDEFINE name;\n+```\n+\n+### 2. Scope\n+\n+All variables will live during the session of a ksqlDB connection, then destroyed when the connection is closed. Only the user\n+in that session can interact with the defined substitution variables. No other users can interact with other users' variables.\n+\n+In CLI, the session is opened when starting the CLI with the `ksql` command, and destroyed when typing `exit`.\n+\n+In headless, the session is opened when starting the ksqlDB server with a SQL script. The variables stay alive until the server is\n+killed.\n+\n+Variables are not persisted anywhere. They are living in memory as long as the session is not terminated.\n+\n+#### RUN SCRIPT command\n+\n+If a `RUN SCRIPT` command is executed in a CLI session, then any variable defined there will be local to the execution context of the\n+script. The variables will override any variable previously defined in the session. When the script is completed, all local variables\n+defined will be destroyed. This ensures users do not override their session variables by accident when running `RUN SCRIPT` commands.\n+\n+#### The SOURCE command\n+\n+To allow users load variables and keep their scope in the session, then the new `SOURCE` command will be added. This will override\n+any previously defined variables, and will be destroyed until the user leaves the session.\n+\n+Syntax:\n+```\n+SOURCE '<script_file>';\n+```\n+\n+The `SOURCE` command will work like a `RUN SCRIPT`. If other SQL statements are in the file, then those statements will also be\n+executed, thus to avoid limiting users from using DDL/DML commands while defining variables at the same time from one single script.\n+\n+`SOURCE` will be used only on the CLI and headless mode. REST API will not accept it because files may be out of the scope of the server filesystem.\n+\n+### 3. Referencing substitution variables\n+\n+Variables will be referenced by wrapping the variable between `{}` characters (i.e. `{replicas}`). These characters are also used by\n+QTT (or ksqlDB functional tests) to replace variables. It's better to keep the same format between testing and production to avoid\n+confusion.\n+\n+Example:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE format = 'AVRO';\n+ksql> DEFINE replicas = '3';\n+ksql> CREATE STREAM stream1 (id INT) WITH (kafka_topic='stream1', value_format='{format}', replicas={replicas});\n+```\n+\n+Substitution will not attempt to add single-quotes to the values. Users will need to know the data type to use when using a variable. The ksqlDB\n+server will be in charge of parsing and failing if the type is not allowed.\n+\n+Note: Variables are not case sensitive. A reference to `{replicas}` is the same as `{REPLICAS}`.\n+\n+### 4.

Syntax\n+\n+#### New syntax decision\n+\n+ksqlDB has a syntax to SET server and CLI properties. The use is `SET` for server properties, and `SET CLI` for CLI settings.\n+\n+For instance:\n+```\n+ksql> SET 'auto.offset.reset' = 'earliest';\n+ksql> SET CLI WRAP OFF;\n+```\n+\n+The quickest assumption is that we can use `SET` for user variables as well. But, we cannot re-use any of the above syntax because\n+of conflicts with current server and CLI setting names. So a new keyword must be use.\n+\n+Some ideas:\n+```\n+SET LOCAL   var1 = 'val1';\n+SET SESSION var1 = 'val1';\n+SET VAR     var1 = 'val1';\n+```\n+\n+`LOCAL` is confusing for users coming from other DBs environments. `LOCAL` is used to keep the scope on per-transaction basis. After a statement\n+is executed, the variable is destroyed.\n+\n+`SESSION` may be also confusing. `SESSION` is used on other DBs to override system variables for that session only. System variables are like ksqlDB\n+server properties.\n+\n+`VAR` seems a better name.\n+\n+However, we're now overloading the use of `SET` statements. For instance, in the future, we might want to use `SET ROLE`  to set the current role\n+fo the user when interacting with an RBAC server. But, if we want to print variable information, how would we do it?\n+```\n+SET VAR var1;  # prints var1 name\n+SET VAR;       # lists all variables\n+SET;           # what to do? lists all server, cli, variables, etc?\n+```\n+\n+Also, the use of single-quotes in `SET` server settings is tedious to type. So after removing them, we'll have two different sets:\n+* `SET 'server_property' = 'server_value'`\n+* `SET VAR variable = `variable_value'\n+\n+This looks confusing too. So we have to decide for a new syntax for substitution variables.\n+\n+Other DBs use different syntax to create user variables (DECLARE, DEFINE, \\set, SET). For ksqlDB, I'll choose to use `DEFINE` and `UNDEFINE` which\n+is what Oracle SQL*plus uses. Any user coming from this DB will immediately understand the command.  \n+This is opened to discussion, but will continue with this for now.\n+\n+#### Creating and printing substitution variables\n+\n+The command to interact with substitution variables is `DEFINE`.  \n+`DEFINE` will allow us to define a new variable, print the variable value and list all current defined variables.\n+\n+Syntax:\n+```\n+DEFINE [name [= 'value']];\n+\n+Where: \n+  name     is the variable name to define\n+  value    is the variable value\n+```\n+Valid variables names start with a letter or underscore (\\_) followed by zero or more alphanumeric characters or underscores.\n+\n+All variable values need to be wrapped using single quotes. All variables are stored as string values in memory, and when\n+replaced, the value without the quotes will be used. ksqlDB parsing will be in charge of determining the format at that\n+time.\n+\n+The reason not to remove single-quotes from values is to allow spaces, and to leave the syntax open for using data types in the future if required.  \n+Also, having decide the format at run-time (i.e. `define n = 3.34238`) is tricky as we could lose precision in case of decimals. Better stay with Strings for now.\n+\n+Define a new variable:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE replicas = '3';\n+ksql> DEFINE partitions = '5';\n+```\n+\n+Print a defined variable value:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE replicas;\n+DEFINE replicas   = '3'\n+```\n+\n+List all defined variables:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE;\n+DEFINE replicas   = '3'\n+DEFINE partitions = '5'\n+```\n+\n+#### Deleting substitution variables\n+\n+The `UNDEFINE` command deletes the variable.\n+\n+Syntax:\n+```\n+UNDEFINE name;\n+```\n+\n+### 2. Scope\n+\n+All variables will live during the session of a ksqlDB connection, then destroyed when the connection is closed. Only the user\n+in that session can interact with the defined substitution variables. No other users can interact with other users' variables.\n+\n+In CLI, the session is opened when starting the CLI with the `ksql` command, and destroyed when typing `exit`.\n+\n+In headless, the session is opened when starting the ksqlDB server with a SQL script. The variables stay alive until the server is\n+killed.\n+\n+Variables are not persisted anywhere. They are living in memory as long as the session is not terminated.\n+\n+#### RUN SCRIPT command\n+\n+If a `RUN SCRIPT` command is executed in a CLI session, then any variable defined there will be local to the execution context of the\n+script. The variables will override any variable previously defined in the session. When the script is completed, all local variables\n+defined will be destroyed.

Syntax\n+\n+#### New syntax decision\n+\n+ksqlDB has a syntax to SET server and CLI properties. The use is `SET` for server properties, and `SET CLI` for CLI settings.\n+\n+For instance:\n+```\n+ksql> SET 'auto.offset.reset' = 'earliest';\n+ksql> SET CLI WRAP OFF;\n+```\n+\n+The quickest assumption is that we can use `SET` for user variables as well. But, we cannot re-use any of the above syntax because\n+of conflicts with current server and CLI setting names. So a new keyword must be use.\n+\n+Some ideas:\n+```\n+SET LOCAL   var1 = 'val1';\n+SET SESSION var1 = 'val1';\n+SET VAR     var1 = 'val1';\n+```\n+\n+`LOCAL` is confusing for users coming from other DBs environments. `LOCAL` is used to keep the scope on per-transaction basis. After a statement\n+is executed, the variable is destroyed.\n+\n+`SESSION` may be also confusing. `SESSION` is used on other DBs to override system variables for that session only. System variables are like ksqlDB\n+server properties.\n+\n+`VAR` seems a better name.\n+\n+However, we're now overloading the use of `SET` statements. For instance, in the future, we might want to use `SET ROLE`  to set the current role\n+fo the user when interacting with an RBAC server. But, if we want to print variable information, how would we do it?\n+```\n+SET VAR var1;  # prints var1 name\n+SET VAR;       # lists all variables\n+SET;           # what to do? lists all server, cli, variables, etc?\n+```\n+\n+Also, the use of single-quotes in `SET` server settings is tedious to type. So after removing them, we'll have two different sets:\n+* `SET 'server_property' = 'server_value'`\n+* `SET VAR variable = `variable_value'\n+\n+This looks confusing too. So we have to decide for a new syntax for substitution variables.\n+\n+Other DBs use different syntax to create user variables (DECLARE, DEFINE, \\set, SET). For ksqlDB, I'll choose to use `DEFINE` and `UNDEFINE` which\n+is what Oracle SQL*plus uses. Any user coming from this DB will immediately understand the command.  \n+This is opened to discussion, but will continue with this for now.\n+\n+#### Creating and printing substitution variables\n+\n+The command to interact with substitution variables is `DEFINE`.  \n+`DEFINE` will allow us to define a new variable, print the variable value and list all current defined variables.\n+\n+Syntax:\n+```\n+DEFINE [name [= 'value']];\n+\n+Where: \n+  name     is the variable name to define\n+  value    is the variable value\n+```\n+Valid variables names start with a letter or underscore (\\_) followed by zero or more alphanumeric characters or underscores.\n+\n+All variable values need to be wrapped using single quotes. All variables are stored as string values in memory, and when\n+replaced, the value without the quotes will be used. ksqlDB parsing will be in charge of determining the format at that\n+time.\n+\n+The reason not to remove single-quotes from values is to allow spaces, and to leave the syntax open for using data types in the future if required.  \n+Also, having decide the format at run-time (i.e. `define n = 3.34238`) is tricky as we could lose precision in case of decimals. Better stay with Strings for now.\n+\n+Define a new variable:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE replicas = '3';\n+ksql> DEFINE partitions = '5';\n+```\n+\n+Print a defined variable value:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE replicas;\n+DEFINE replicas   = '3'\n+```\n+\n+List all defined variables:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE;\n+DEFINE replicas   = '3'\n+DEFINE partitions = '5'\n+```\n+\n+#### Deleting substitution variables\n+\n+The `UNDEFINE` command deletes the variable.\n+\n+Syntax:\n+```\n+UNDEFINE name;\n+```\n+\n+### 2. Scope\n+\n+All variables will live during the session of a ksqlDB connection, then destroyed when the connection is closed. Only the user\n+in that session can interact with the defined substitution variables. No other users can interact with other users' variables.\n+\n+In CLI, the session is opened when starting the CLI with the `ksql` command, and destroyed when typing `exit`.\n+\n+In headless, the session is opened when starting the ksqlDB server with a SQL script. The variables stay alive until the server is\n+killed.\n+\n+Variables are not persisted anywhere. They are living in memory as long as the session is not terminated.\n+\n+#### RUN SCRIPT command\n+\n+If a `RUN SCRIPT` command is executed in a CLI session, then any variable defined there will be local to the execution context of the\n+script. The variables will override any variable previously defined in the session. When the script is completed, all local variables\n+defined will be destroyed. This ensures users do not override their session variables by accident when running `RUN SCRIPT` commands.\n+\n+#### The SOURCE command\n+\n+To allow users load variables and keep their scope in the session, then the new `SOURCE` command will be added. This will override\n+any previously defined variables, and will be destroyed until the user leaves the session.\n+\n+Syntax:\n+```\n+SOURCE '<script_file>';\n+```\n+\n+The `SOURCE` command will work like a `RUN SCRIPT`. If other SQL statements are in the file, then those statements will also be\n+executed, thus to avoid limiting users from using DDL/DML commands while defining variables at the same time from one single script.\n+\n+`SOURCE` will be used only on the CLI and headless mode. REST API will not accept it because files may be out of the scope of the server filesystem.\n+\n+### 3. Referencing substitution variables\n+\n+Variables will be referenced by wrapping the variable between `{}` characters (i.e. `{replicas}`). These characters are also used by\n+QTT (or ksqlDB functional tests) to replace variables. It's better to keep the same format between testing and production to avoid\n+confusion.\n+\n+Example:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE format = 'AVRO';\n+ksql> DEFINE replicas = '3';\n+ksql> CREATE STREAM stream1 (id INT) WITH (kafka_topic='stream1', value_format='{format}', replicas={replicas});\n+```\n+\n+Substitution will not attempt to add single-quotes to the values. Users will need to know the data type to use when using a variable. The ksqlDB\n+server will be in charge of parsing and failing if the type is not allowed.\n+\n+Note: Variables are not case sensitive.

Syntax\n+\n+#### New syntax decision\n+\n+ksqlDB has a syntax to SET server and CLI properties. The use is `SET` for server properties, and `SET CLI` for CLI settings.\n+\n+For instance:\n+```\n+ksql> SET 'auto.offset.reset' = 'earliest';\n+ksql> SET CLI WRAP OFF;\n+```\n+\n+The quickest assumption is that we can use `SET` for user variables as well. But, we cannot re-use any of the above syntax because\n+of conflicts with current server and CLI setting names. So a new keyword must be use.\n+\n+Some ideas:\n+```\n+SET LOCAL   var1 = 'val1';\n+SET SESSION var1 = 'val1';\n+SET VAR     var1 = 'val1';\n+```\n+\n+`LOCAL` is confusing for users coming from other DBs environments. `LOCAL` is used to keep the scope on per-transaction basis. After a statement\n+is executed, the variable is destroyed.\n+\n+`SESSION` may be also confusing. `SESSION` is used on other DBs to override system variables for that session only. System variables are like ksqlDB\n+server properties.\n+\n+`VAR` seems a better name.\n+\n+However, we're now overloading the use of `SET` statements. For instance, in the future, we might want to use `SET ROLE`  to set the current role\n+fo the user when interacting with an RBAC server. But, if we want to print variable information, how would we do it?\n+```\n+SET VAR var1;  # prints var1 name\n+SET VAR;       # lists all variables\n+SET;           # what to do? lists all server, cli, variables, etc?\n+```\n+\n+Also, the use of single-quotes in `SET` server settings is tedious to type. So after removing them, we'll have two different sets:\n+* `SET 'server_property' = 'server_value'`\n+* `SET VAR variable = `variable_value'\n+\n+This looks confusing too. So we have to decide for a new syntax for substitution variables.\n+\n+Other DBs use different syntax to create user variables (DECLARE, DEFINE, \\set, SET). For ksqlDB, I'll choose to use `DEFINE` and `UNDEFINE` which\n+is what Oracle SQL*plus uses. Any user coming from this DB will immediately understand the command.  \n+This is opened to discussion, but will continue with this for now.\n+\n+#### Creating and printing substitution variables\n+\n+The command to interact with substitution variables is `DEFINE`.  \n+`DEFINE` will allow us to define a new variable, print the variable value and list all current defined variables.\n+\n+Syntax:\n+```\n+DEFINE [name [= 'value']];\n+\n+Where: \n+  name     is the variable name to define\n+  value    is the variable value\n+```\n+Valid variables names start with a letter or underscore (\\_) followed by zero or more alphanumeric characters or underscores.\n+\n+All variable values need to be wrapped using single quotes. All variables are stored as string values in memory, and when\n+replaced, the value without the quotes will be used. ksqlDB parsing will be in charge of determining the format at that\n+time.\n+\n+The reason not to remove single-quotes from values is to allow spaces, and to leave the syntax open for using data types in the future if required.  \n+Also, having decide the format at run-time (i.e. `define n = 3.34238`) is tricky as we could lose precision in case of decimals. Better stay with Strings for now.\n+\n+Define a new variable:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE replicas = '3';\n+ksql> DEFINE partitions = '5';\n+```\n+\n+Print a defined variable value:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE replicas;\n+DEFINE replicas   = '3'\n+```\n+\n+List all defined variables:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE;\n+DEFINE replicas   = '3'\n+DEFINE partitions = '5'\n+```\n+\n+#### Deleting substitution variables\n+\n+The `UNDEFINE` command deletes the variable.\n+\n+Syntax:\n+```\n+UNDEFINE name;\n+```\n+\n+### 2. Scope\n+\n+All variables will live during the session of a ksqlDB connection, then destroyed when the connection is closed. Only the user\n+in that session can interact with the defined substitution variables. No other users can interact with other users' variables.\n+\n+In CLI, the session is opened when starting the CLI with the `ksql` command, and destroyed when typing `exit`.\n+\n+In headless, the session is opened when starting the ksqlDB server with a SQL script. The variables stay alive until the server is\n+killed.\n+\n+Variables are not persisted anywhere. They are living in memory as long as the session is not terminated.\n+\n+#### RUN SCRIPT command\n+\n+If a `RUN SCRIPT` command is executed in a CLI session, then any variable defined there will be local to the execution context of the\n+script. The variables will override any variable previously defined in the session. When the script is completed, all local variables\n+defined will be destroyed. This ensures users do not override their session variables by accident when running `RUN SCRIPT` commands.\n+\n+#### The SOURCE command\n+\n+To allow users load variables and keep their scope in the session, then the new `SOURCE` command will be added. This will override\n+any previously defined variables, and will be destroyed until the user leaves the session.\n+\n+Syntax:\n+```\n+SOURCE '<script_file>';\n+```\n+\n+The `SOURCE` command will work like a `RUN SCRIPT`. If other SQL statements are in the file, then those statements will also be\n+executed, thus to avoid limiting users from using DDL/DML commands while defining variables at the same time from one single script.\n+\n+`SOURCE` will be used only on the CLI and headless mode. REST API will not accept it because files may be out of the scope of the server filesystem.\n+\n+### 3. Referencing substitution variables\n+\n+Variables will be referenced by wrapping the variable between `{}` characters (i.e. `{replicas}`). These characters are also used by\n+QTT (or ksqlDB functional tests) to replace variables. It's better to keep the same format between testing and production to avoid\n+confusion.\n+\n+Example:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE format = 'AVRO';\n+ksql> DEFINE replicas = '3';\n+ksql> CREATE STREAM stream1 (id INT) WITH (kafka_topic='stream1', value_format='{format}', replicas={replicas});\n+```\n+\n+Substitution will not attempt to add single-quotes to the values. Users will need to know the data type to use when using a variable. The ksqlDB\n+server will be in charge of parsing and failing if the type is not allowed.\n+\n+Note: Variables are not case sensitive. A reference to `{replicas}` is the same as `{REPLICAS}`.\n+\n+### 4. Context for substitution variables\n+\n+Variable substitution will be allowed only in specific SQL statements, and only in places where literals or hard-coded values can be used.\n+Variables cannot be used as column-names, reserved keywords, etc.\n+\n+For instance (`{VAR}` is used a reference where variables are permitted):\n+```\n+ksql> CREATE STREAM <name> (col1 INT, col2 STRING) WITH (kafka_topic='{VAR}', format='{VAR}', replicas={VAR}, ...);\n+ksql> INSERT INTO <stream> (col1, col2) VALUES ({VAR}, '{VAR}');\n+ksql> SELECT * FROM <stream> WHERE col1 == {VAR} and col2 == '{VAR}' EMIT CHANGES; \n+```\n+Any attempt of using variables on non-permitted places will fail with the current SQL parsing error found when parsing the variable string.\n+\n+Variables can also be assigned to other variables:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE var1 = 'topic';\n+ksql> DEFINE var2 = 'other_{var1}';\n+ksql> DEFINE var2;\n+DEFINE var2    = 'other_topic'\n+```\n+\n+Variables can also be assigned to set server or CLI settings:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE offset = 'earliest'\n+ksql> SET 'auto.offset.reset' = '{offset}';\n+\n+ksql> DEFINE wrap_toggle = 'ON'\n+ksql> SET CLI WRAP {WRAP_TOGGLE}\n+```\n+\n+Variables can also be used as nested variables:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE env = 'prod';\n+\n+ksql> DEFINE topic_prod = 'topic_prod';\n+ksql> DEFINE topic_qa = 'topic_qa';\n+\n+ksql> CREATE STREAM ... WITH (kafka_topic='{topic_{env}}'); \n+```\n+\n+### 5. Enable/disable substitution variables\n+\n+When using CLI, we'll use the `SET CLI VARIABLE-SUBSTITUTION (ON|OFF)` command to enable/disable subsitution. Default will be `ON`.\n+```\n+ksql> SET CLI VARIABLE-SUBSTITUTION OFF;\n+ksql> CREATE STREAM ... WITH (kafka_topic='{topic_{env}}');\n+Error: Fail because {topic_{env}} topic name is invalid. \n+```\n+The error message is just an example of what ksqlDB will display.\n+\n+When using SQL scripts in headless mode, we need to provide a server setting to enable/disable variable substitution. The setting will be\n+`ksql.enable.headless.variable.substitution` as Boolean (default = true). The reason is that `SET CLI` is a CLI-specific command not available\n+in headless execution. Also, CLI should not request the Server is variable substitution is enabled as that should be a user decision to substitute or not.\n+\n+### 6. Implementation\n+\n+For CLI, variable substitution will happen in the CLI side before making a ksqlDB request to the server. This allows less changes in ksqlDB code as we have  \n+the `SET CLI` to enable/disable, and variables will be living in the CLI server memory, so we have quickly access to them.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "86bad6aa26418ae7d093c189c2c2350845ac5984"}, "originalPosition": 259}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5MTIzMDU4Ng==", "bodyText": "Mmm, forgot about that.

The use is `SET` for server properties, and `SET CLI` for CLI settings.\n+\n+For instance:\n+```\n+ksql> SET 'auto.offset.reset' = 'earliest';\n+ksql> SET CLI WRAP OFF;\n+```\n+\n+The quickest assumption is that we can use `SET` for user variables as well. But, we cannot re-use any of the above syntax because\n+of conflicts with current server and CLI setting names. So a new keyword must be use.\n+\n+Some ideas:\n+```\n+SET LOCAL   var1 = 'val1';\n+SET SESSION var1 = 'val1';\n+SET VAR     var1 = 'val1';\n+```\n+\n+`LOCAL` is confusing for users coming from other DBs environments. `LOCAL` is used to keep the scope on per-transaction basis. After a statement\n+is executed, the variable is destroyed.\n+\n+`SESSION` may be also confusing. `SESSION` is used on other DBs to override system variables for that session only. System variables are like ksqlDB\n+server properties.\n+\n+`VAR` seems a better name.\n+\n+However, we're now overloading the use of `SET` statements. For instance, in the future, we might want to use `SET ROLE`  to set the current role\n+fo the user when interacting with an RBAC server. But, if we want to print variable information, how would we do it?\n+```\n+SET VAR var1;  # prints var1 name\n+SET VAR;       # lists all variables\n+SET;           # what to do? lists all server, cli, variables, etc?\n+```\n+\n+Also, the use of single-quotes in `SET` server settings is tedious to type. So after removing them, we'll have two different sets:\n+* `SET 'server_property' = 'server_value'`\n+* `SET VAR variable = `variable_value'\n+\n+This looks confusing too. So we have to decide for a new syntax for substitution variables.\n+\n+Other DBs use different syntax to create user variables (DECLARE, DEFINE, \\set, SET). For ksqlDB, I'll choose to use `DEFINE` and `UNDEFINE` which\n+is what Oracle SQL*plus uses. Any user coming from this DB will immediately understand the command.  \n+This is opened to discussion, but will continue with this for now.\n+\n+#### Creating and printing substitution variables\n+\n+The command to interact with substitution variables is `DEFINE`.  \n+`DEFINE` will allow us to define a new variable, print the variable value and list all current defined variables.\n+\n+Syntax:\n+```\n+DEFINE [name [= 'value']];\n+\n+Where: \n+  name     is the variable name to define\n+  value    is the variable value\n+```\n+Valid variables names start with a letter or underscore (\\_) followed by zero or more alphanumeric characters or underscores.\n+\n+All variable values need to be wrapped using single quotes. All variables are stored as string values in memory, and when\n+replaced, the value without the quotes will be used. ksqlDB parsing will be in charge of determining the format at that\n+time.\n+\n+The reason not to remove single-quotes from values is to allow spaces, and to leave the syntax open for using data types in the future if required.  \n+Also, having decide the format at run-time (i.e. `define n = 3.34238`) is tricky as we could lose precision in case of decimals. Better stay with Strings for now.\n+\n+Define a new variable:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE replicas = '3';\n+ksql> DEFINE partitions = '5';\n+```\n+\n+Print a defined variable value:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE replicas;\n+DEFINE replicas   = '3'\n+```\n+\n+List all defined variables:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE;\n+DEFINE replicas   = '3'\n+DEFINE partitions = '5'\n+```\n+\n+#### Deleting substitution variables\n+\n+The `UNDEFINE` command deletes the variable.\n+\n+Syntax:\n+```\n+UNDEFINE name;\n+```\n+\n+### 2. Scope\n+\n+All variables will live during the session of a ksqlDB connection, then destroyed when the connection is closed. Only the user\n+in that session can interact with the defined substitution variables. No other users can interact with other users' variables.\n+\n+In CLI, the session is opened when starting the CLI with the `ksql` command, and destroyed when typing `exit`.\n+\n+In headless, the session is opened when starting the ksqlDB server with a SQL script. The variables stay alive until the server is\n+killed.\n+\n+Variables are not persisted anywhere. They are living in memory as long as the session is not terminated.\n+\n+#### RUN SCRIPT command\n+\n+If a `RUN SCRIPT` command is executed in a CLI session, then any variable defined there will be local to the execution context of the\n+script. The variables will override any variable previously defined in the session. When the script is completed, all local variables\n+defined will be destroyed. This ensures users do not override their session variables by accident when running `RUN SCRIPT` commands.\n+\n+#### The SOURCE command\n+\n+To allow users load variables and keep their scope in the session, then the new `SOURCE` command will be added. This will override\n+any previously defined variables, and will be destroyed until the user leaves the session.\n+\n+Syntax:\n+```\n+SOURCE '<script_file>';\n+```\n+\n+The `SOURCE` command will work like a `RUN SCRIPT`. If other SQL statements are in the file, then those statements will also be\n+executed, thus to avoid limiting users from using DDL/DML commands while defining variables at the same time from one single script.\n+\n+`SOURCE` will be used only on the CLI and headless mode. REST API will not accept it because files may be out of the scope of the server filesystem.\n+\n+### 3. Referencing substitution variables\n+\n+Variables will be referenced by wrapping the variable between `{}` characters (i.e. `{replicas}`). These characters are also used by\n+QTT (or ksqlDB functional tests) to replace variables. It's better to keep the same format between testing and production to avoid\n+confusion.\n+\n+Example:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE format = 'AVRO';\n+ksql> DEFINE replicas = '3';\n+ksql> CREATE STREAM stream1 (id INT) WITH (kafka_topic='stream1', value_format='{format}', replicas={replicas});\n+```\n+\n+Substitution will not attempt to add single-quotes to the values. Users will need to know the data type to use when using a variable. The ksqlDB\n+server will be in charge of parsing and failing if the type is not allowed.\n+\n+Note: Variables are not case sensitive. A reference to `{replicas}` is the same as `{REPLICAS}`.\n+\n+### 4. Context for substitution variables\n+\n+Variable substitution will be allowed only in specific SQL statements, and only in places where literals or hard-coded values can be used.\n+Variables cannot be used as column-names, reserved keywords, etc.\n+\n+For instance (`{VAR}` is used a reference where variables are permitted):\n+```\n+ksql> CREATE STREAM <name> (col1 INT, col2 STRING) WITH (kafka_topic='{VAR}', format='{VAR}', replicas={VAR}, ...);\n+ksql> INSERT INTO <stream> (col1, col2) VALUES ({VAR}, '{VAR}');\n+ksql> SELECT * FROM <stream> WHERE col1 == {VAR} and col2 == '{VAR}' EMIT CHANGES; \n+```\n+Any attempt of using variables on non-permitted places will fail with the current SQL parsing error found when parsing the variable string.\n+\n+Variables can also be assigned to other variables:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE var1 = 'topic';\n+ksql> DEFINE var2 = 'other_{var1}';\n+ksql> DEFINE var2;\n+DEFINE var2    = 'other_topic'\n+```\n+\n+Variables can also be assigned to set server or CLI settings:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE offset = 'earliest'\n+ksql> SET 'auto.offset.reset' = '{offset}';\n+\n+ksql> DEFINE wrap_toggle = 'ON'\n+ksql> SET CLI WRAP {WRAP_TOGGLE}\n+```\n+\n+Variables can also be used as nested variables:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE env = 'prod';\n+\n+ksql> DEFINE topic_prod = 'topic_prod';\n+ksql> DEFINE topic_qa = 'topic_qa';\n+\n+ksql> CREATE STREAM ... WITH (kafka_topic='{topic_{env}}'); \n+```\n+\n+### 5. Enable/disable substitution variables\n+\n+When using CLI, we'll use the `SET CLI VARIABLE-SUBSTITUTION (ON|OFF)` command to enable/disable subsitution. Default will be `ON`.\n+```\n+ksql> SET CLI VARIABLE-SUBSTITUTION OFF;\n+ksql> CREATE STREAM ... WITH (kafka_topic='{topic_{env}}');\n+Error: Fail because {topic_{env}} topic name is invalid. \n+```\n+The error message is just an example of what ksqlDB will display.\n+\n+When using SQL scripts in headless mode, we need to provide a server setting to enable/disable variable substitution. The setting will be\n+`ksql.enable.headless.variable.substitution` as Boolean (default = true). The reason is that `SET CLI` is a CLI-specific command not available\n+in headless execution. Also, CLI should not request the Server is variable substitution is enabled as that should be a user decision to substitute or not.\n+\n+### 6. Implementation\n+\n+For CLI, variable substitution will happen in the CLI side before making a ksqlDB request to the server. This allows less changes in ksqlDB code as we have  \n+the `SET CLI` to enable/disable, and variables will be living in the CLI server memory, so we have quickly access to them.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5MTE4NzczMw=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "86bad6aa26418ae7d093c189c2c2350845ac5984"}, "originalPosition": 259}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5MjEzODEwMg==", "bodyText": "We can think of this as a feature of clients, where each client that supports string substitution applies any transformations before sending the SQL to the server.\nThe Confluent Cloud UI is a ksqlDB client that can implement support for substitution at some point.

Any user coming from this DB will immediately understand the command.  \n+This is opened to discussion, but will continue with this for now.\n+\n+#### Creating and printing substitution variables\n+\n+The command to interact with substitution variables is `DEFINE`.  \n+`DEFINE` will allow us to define a new variable, print the variable value and list all current defined variables.\n+\n+Syntax:\n+```\n+DEFINE [name [= 'value']];\n+\n+Where: \n+  name     is the variable name to define\n+  value    is the variable value\n+```\n+Valid variables names start with a letter or underscore (\\_) followed by zero or more alphanumeric characters or underscores.\n+\n+All variable values need to be wrapped using single quotes. All variables are stored as string values in memory, and when\n+replaced, the value without the quotes will be used. ksqlDB parsing will be in charge of determining the format at that\n+time.\n+\n+The reason not to remove single-quotes from values is to allow spaces, and to leave the syntax open for using data types in the future if required.  \n+Also, having decide the format at run-time (i.e. `define n = 3.34238`) is tricky as we could lose precision in case of decimals. Better stay with Strings for now.\n+\n+Define a new variable:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE replicas = '3';\n+ksql> DEFINE partitions = '5';\n+```\n+\n+Print a defined variable value:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE replicas;\n+DEFINE replicas   = '3'\n+```\n+\n+List all defined variables:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE;\n+DEFINE replicas   = '3'\n+DEFINE partitions = '5'\n+```\n+\n+#### Deleting substitution variables\n+\n+The `UNDEFINE` command deletes the variable.\n+\n+Syntax:\n+```\n+UNDEFINE name;\n+```\n+\n+### 2. Scope\n+\n+All variables will live during the session of a ksqlDB connection, then destroyed when the connection is closed. Only the user\n+in that session can interact with the defined substitution variables. No other users can interact with other users' variables.\n+\n+In CLI, the session is opened when starting the CLI with the `ksql` command, and destroyed when typing `exit`.\n+\n+In headless, the session is opened when starting the ksqlDB server with a SQL script. The variables stay alive until the server is\n+killed.\n+\n+Variables are not persisted anywhere. They are living in memory as long as the session is not terminated.\n+\n+#### RUN SCRIPT command\n+\n+If a `RUN SCRIPT` command is executed in a CLI session, then any variable defined there will be local to the execution context of the\n+script. The variables will override any variable previously defined in the session. When the script is completed, all local variables\n+defined will be destroyed. This ensures users do not override their session variables by accident when running `RUN SCRIPT` commands.\n+\n+#### The SOURCE command\n+\n+To allow users load variables and keep their scope in the session, then the new `SOURCE` command will be added. This will override\n+any previously defined variables, and will be destroyed until the user leaves the session.\n+\n+Syntax:\n+```\n+SOURCE '<script_file>';\n+```\n+\n+The `SOURCE` command will work like a `RUN SCRIPT`. If other SQL statements are in the file, then those statements will also be\n+executed, thus to avoid limiting users from using DDL/DML commands while defining variables at the same time from one single script.\n+\n+`SOURCE` will be used only on the CLI and headless mode. REST API will not accept it because files may be out of the scope of the server filesystem.\n+\n+### 3.

Syntax\n+\n+#### New syntax decision\n+\n+ksqlDB has a syntax to SET server and CLI properties. The use is `SET` for server properties, and `SET CLI` for CLI settings.\n+\n+For instance:\n+```\n+ksql> SET 'auto.offset.reset' = 'earliest';\n+ksql> SET CLI WRAP OFF;\n+```\n+\n+The quickest assumption is that we can use `SET` for user variables as well. But, we cannot re-use any of the above syntax because\n+of conflicts with current server and CLI setting names. So a new keyword must be use.\n+\n+Some ideas:\n+```\n+SET LOCAL   var1 = 'val1';\n+SET SESSION var1 = 'val1';\n+SET VAR     var1 = 'val1';\n+```\n+\n+`LOCAL` is confusing for users coming from other DBs environments. `LOCAL` is used to keep the scope on per-transaction basis. After a statement\n+is executed, the variable is destroyed.\n+\n+`SESSION` may be also confusing. `SESSION` is used on other DBs to override system variables for that session only. System variables are like ksqlDB\n+server properties.\n+\n+`VAR` seems a better name.\n+\n+However, we're now overloading the use of `SET` statements. For instance, in the future, we might want to use `SET ROLE`  to set the current role\n+fo the user when interacting with an RBAC server. But, if we want to print variable information, how would we do it?\n+```\n+SET VAR var1;  # prints var1 name\n+SET VAR;       # lists all variables\n+SET;           # what to do? lists all server, cli, variables, etc?\n+```\n+\n+Also, the use of single-quotes in `SET` server settings is tedious to type. So after removing them, we'll have two different sets:\n+* `SET 'server_property' = 'server_value'`\n+* `SET VAR variable = `variable_value'\n+\n+This looks confusing too.

Any user coming from this DB will immediately understand the command.  \n+This is opened to discussion, but will continue with this for now.\n+\n+#### Creating and printing substitution variables\n+\n+The command to interact with substitution variables is `DEFINE`.  \n+`DEFINE` will allow us to define a new variable, print the variable value and list all current defined variables.\n+\n+Syntax:\n+```\n+DEFINE [name [= 'value']];\n+\n+Where: \n+  name     is the variable name to define\n+  value    is the variable value\n+```\n+Valid variables names start with a letter or underscore (\\_) followed by zero or more alphanumeric characters or underscores.\n+\n+All variable values need to be wrapped using single quotes.

Scope\n+\n+This variable has a session scope.\n+\n+Variables will live during the session of a ksqlDB connection, then destroyed when the connection is closed. Only the user\n+in that session can interact with the defined substitution variables. No other users can interact with other users' variables.\n+\n+In CLI, the session is opened when starting the CLI with the `ksql` command, and destroyed when typing `exit`.\n+\n+In Java API client, the session is opened when `Client.create()` is called, and closed when `Client.close()` is called. Variables\n+may be defined using a client method instead of a new syntax. This is to ensure users know the scope starts after the `create()` call.\n+\n+TBD: Define a Java API method for variable substitution.\n+\n+In headless, the session is opened when starting the ksqlDB server with a SQL script. The variables stay alive until the server is\n+killed.\n+\n+Variables are not persisted anywhere. They are living in memory as long as the session is not terminated.\n+\n+#### RUN SCRIPT command\n+\n+If a `RUN SCRIPT` command is executed in a CLI session, then any variable defined there will be local to the execution context of the\n+script. The variables will override any variable previously defined in the session. When the script is completed, all local variables\n+defined will be destroyed. This ensures users do not override their session variables by accident when running `RUN SCRIPT` commands.\n+\n+#### The SOURCE command\n+\n+To allow users load variables and keep their scope in the session, then the new `SOURCE` command will be added. This will override\n+any previously defined variables, and will be destroyed until the user leaves the session.\n+\n+Syntax:\n+```\n+SOURCE '<script_file>';\n+```\n+\n+The `SOURCE` command will work like a `RUN SCRIPT`. If other SQL statements are in the file, then those statements will also be\n+executed, thus to avoid limiting users from using DDL/DML commands while defining variables at the same time from one single script.\n+\n+`SOURCE` will be used only on the CLI and headless mode. REST API will not accept it because files may be out of the scope of the server filesystem.\n+\n+### 3. Referencing substitution variables\n+\n+Variables will be referenced by wrapping the variable between `${}` characters (i.e. `${replicas}`).", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "d4d905feae50519b77d5c2a572f0129f927a3d1e"}, "originalPosition": 193}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5MjQxNDQzMw==", "bodyText": "In Oracle, the & prompts users to type the variable value when not defined, and && to reuse the variable after the user has typed a value.

The variables will override any variable previously defined in the session. When the script is completed, all local variables\n+defined will be destroyed. This ensures users do not override their session variables by accident when running `RUN SCRIPT` commands.\n+\n+#### The SOURCE command\n+\n+To allow users load variables and keep their scope in the session, then the new `SOURCE` command will be added.

Better stay with Strings for now.\n+\n+Define a new variable:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE replicas = '3';\n+ksql> DEFINE partitions = '5';\n+```\n+\n+Print a defined variable value:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE replicas;\n+DEFINE replicas   = '3'\n+```\n+\n+List all defined variables:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE;\n+DEFINE replicas   = '3'\n+DEFINE partitions = '5'\n+```\n+\n+#### Deleting substitution variables\n+\n+The `UNDEFINE` command deletes the variable.\n+\n+Syntax:\n+```\n+UNDEFINE name;\n+```\n+\n+### 2. Scope\n+\n+This variable has a session scope.\n+\n+Variables will live during the session of a ksqlDB connection, then destroyed when the connection is closed. Only the user\n+in that session can interact with the defined substitution variables. No other users can interact with other users' variables.\n+\n+In CLI, the session is opened when starting the CLI with the `ksql` command, and destroyed when typing `exit`.\n+\n+In Java API client, the session is opened when `Client.create()` is called, and closed when `Client.close()` is called. Variables\n+may be defined using a client method instead of a new syntax. This is to ensure users know the scope starts after the `create()` call.\n+\n+TBD: Define a Java API method for variable substitution.\n+\n+In headless, the session is opened when starting the ksqlDB server with a SQL script. The variables stay alive until the server is\n+killed.\n+\n+Variables are not persisted anywhere. They are living in memory as long as the session is not terminated.\n+\n+#### RUN SCRIPT command\n+\n+If a `RUN SCRIPT` command is executed in a CLI session, then any variable defined there will be local to the execution context of the\n+script. The variables will override any variable previously defined in the session. When the script is completed, all local variables\n+defined will be destroyed. This ensures users do not override their session variables by accident when running `RUN SCRIPT` commands.\n+\n+#### The SOURCE command\n+\n+To allow users load variables and keep their scope in the session, then the new `SOURCE` command will be added. This will override\n+any previously defined variables, and will be destroyed until the user leaves the session.\n+\n+Syntax:\n+```\n+SOURCE '<script_file>';\n+```\n+\n+The `SOURCE` command will work like a `RUN SCRIPT`. If other SQL statements are in the file, then those statements will also be\n+executed, thus to avoid limiting users from using DDL/DML commands while defining variables at the same time from one single script.\n+\n+`SOURCE` will be used only on the CLI and headless mode. REST API will not accept it because files may be out of the scope of the server filesystem.\n+\n+### 3. Referencing substitution variables\n+\n+Variables will be referenced by wrapping the variable between `${}` characters (i.e. `${replicas}`).\n+\n+Noe: We need to make changes in QTT tests to use `${}` references instead of `{}` for consistency.\n+\n+Example:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE format = 'AVRO';\n+ksql> DEFINE replicas = '3';\n+ksql> CREATE STREAM stream1 (id INT) WITH (kafka_topic='stream1', value_format='${format}', replicas=${replicas});\n+```\n+\n+Substitution will not attempt to add single-quotes to the values. Users will need to know the data type to use when using a variable. The ksqlDB\n+server will be in charge of parsing and failing if the type is not allowed.\n+\n+Note: Variables are case-insensitive. A reference to `${replicas}` is the same as `${REPLICAS}`.\n+\n+### 4. Context for substitution variables\n+\n+Variable substitution will be allowed in specific SQL statements. They can be used to replace text and non-text literals, and identifiers such as\n+column names and stream/table names. Variables cannot be used as reserved keywords.\n+\n+For instance:\n+\n+Note: `{VAR}` is used a reference where variables are permitted.\n+```\n+ksql> CREATE STREAM ${streamName} (${colName1} INT, ${colName2} STRING) \\\n+      WITH (kafka_topic='${topicName}', format='${format}', replicas=${replicas}, ...);\n+      \n+ksql> INSERT INTO ${streamName} (${colName1}, ${colName2}) \\\n+      VALUES (${val1}, '${val2}');\n+\n+ksql> SELECT * FROM ${streamName} \\\n+      WHERE ${colName1} == ${val1} and ${colName2} == '${val2}' EMIT CHANGES; \n+```\n+Any attempt of using variables on non-permitted places will fail with the current SQL parsing error found when parsing the variable string.\n+\n+Variables can also be assigned to other variables:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE var1 = 'topic';\n+ksql> DEFINE var2 = 'other_${var1}';\n+ksql> DEFINE var2;\n+DEFINE var2    = 'other_topic'\n+```\n+\n+Variables can also be assigned to set server or CLI settings:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE offset = 'earliest'\n+ksql> SET 'auto.offset.reset' = '${offset}';\n+\n+ksql> DEFINE wrap_toggle = 'ON'\n+ksql> SET CLI WRAP ${WRAP_TOGGLE}\n+```\n+\n+Variables can also be used as nested variables:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE env = 'prod';\n+\n+ksql> DEFINE topic_prod = 'my_prod_topic';\n+ksql> DEFINE topic_qa = 'my_qa_topic';\n+\n+ksql> CREATE STREAM ... WITH (kafka_topic='${topic_${env}}'); \n+```\n+\n+### 5. Enable/disable substitution variables\n+\n+When using CLI, we'll use the `SET CLI VARIABLE-SUBSTITUTION (ON|OFF)` command to enable/disable subsitution. Default will be `ON`.\n+```\n+ksql> SET CLI VARIABLE-SUBSTITUTION OFF;\n+ksql> CREATE STREAM ... WITH (kafka_topic='${topic_${env}}');\n+Error: Fail because ${topic_${env}} topic name is invalid. \n+```\n+The error message is just an example of what ksqlDB will display.\n+\n+When using SQL scripts in headless mode, we need to provide a server setting to enable/disable variable substitution.

Syntax\n+\n+#### New syntax decision\n+\n+ksqlDB has a syntax to SET server and CLI properties. The use is `SET` for server properties, and `SET CLI` for CLI settings.\n+\n+For instance:\n+```\n+ksql> SET 'auto.offset.reset' = 'earliest';\n+ksql> SET CLI WRAP OFF;\n+```\n+\n+The quickest assumption is that we can use `SET` for user variables as well. But, we cannot re-use any of the above syntax because\n+of conflicts with current server and CLI setting names. So a new keyword must be use.\n+\n+Some ideas:\n+```\n+SET LOCAL   var1 = 'val1';\n+SET SESSION var1 = 'val1';\n+SET VAR     var1 = 'val1';\n+```\n+\n+`LOCAL` is confusing for users coming from other DBs environments. `LOCAL` is used to keep the scope on per-transaction basis. After a statement\n+is executed, the variable is destroyed.\n+\n+`SESSION` may be also confusing. `SESSION` is used on other DBs to override system variables for that session only. System variables are like ksqlDB\n+server properties.\n+\n+`VAR` seems a better name.\n+\n+However, we're now overloading the use of `SET` statements. For instance, in the future, we might want to use `SET ROLE`  to set the current role\n+fo the user when interacting with an RBAC server. But, if we want to print variable information, how would we do it?\n+```\n+SET VAR var1;  # prints var1 name\n+SET VAR;       # lists all variables\n+SET;           # what to do? lists all server, cli, variables, etc?\n+```\n+\n+Also, the use of single-quotes in `SET` server settings is tedious to type. So after removing them, we'll have two different sets:\n+* `SET 'server_property' = 'server_value'`\n+* `SET VAR variable = `variable_value'\n+\n+This looks confusing too. So we have to decide for a new syntax for substitution variables.\n+\n+Other DBs use different syntax to create user variables (DECLARE, DEFINE, \\set, SET). For ksqlDB, I'll choose to use `DEFINE` and `UNDEFINE` which\n+is what Oracle SQL*plus uses. Any user coming from this DB will immediately understand the command.  \n+This is opened to discussion, but will continue with this for now.\n+\n+#### Creating and printing substitution variables\n+\n+The command to interact with substitution variables is `DEFINE`.  \n+`DEFINE` will allow us to define a new variable, print the variable value and list all current defined variables.\n+\n+Syntax:\n+```\n+DEFINE [name [= 'value']];\n+\n+Where: \n+  name     is the variable name to define\n+  value    is the variable value\n+```\n+Valid variables names start with a letter or underscore (\\_) followed by zero or more alphanumeric characters or underscores.\n+\n+All variable values need to be wrapped using single quotes. All variables are stored as string values in memory, and when\n+replaced, the value without the quotes will be used. ksqlDB parsing will be in charge of determining the format at that\n+time.\n+\n+The reason not to remove single-quotes from values is to allow spaces, and to leave the syntax open for using data types in the future if required.  \n+Also, having decide the format at run-time (i.e. `define n = 3.34238`) is tricky as we could lose precision in case of decimals. Better stay with Strings for now.\n+\n+Define a new variable:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE replicas = '3';\n+ksql> DEFINE partitions = '5';\n+```\n+\n+Print a defined variable value:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE replicas;\n+DEFINE replicas   = '3'\n+```\n+\n+List all defined variables:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE;\n+DEFINE replicas   = '3'\n+DEFINE partitions = '5'\n+```\n+\n+#### Deleting substitution variables\n+\n+The `UNDEFINE` command deletes the variable.\n+\n+Syntax:\n+```\n+UNDEFINE name;\n+```\n+\n+### 2. Scope\n+\n+This variable has a session scope.\n+\n+Variables will live during the session of a ksqlDB connection, then destroyed when the connection is closed. Only the user\n+in that session can interact with the defined substitution variables. No other users can interact with other users' variables.\n+\n+In CLI, the session is opened when starting the CLI with the `ksql` command, and destroyed when typing `exit`.\n+\n+In Java API client, the session is opened when `Client.create()` is called, and closed when `Client.close()` is called. Variables\n+may be defined using a client method instead of a new syntax. This is to ensure users know the scope starts after the `create()` call.\n+\n+TBD: Define a Java API method for variable substitution.\n+\n+In headless, the session is opened when starting the ksqlDB server with a SQL script. The variables stay alive until the server is\n+killed.\n+\n+Variables are not persisted anywhere. They are living in memory as long as the session is not terminated.\n+\n+#### RUN SCRIPT command\n+\n+If a `RUN SCRIPT` command is executed in a CLI session, then any variable defined there will be local to the execution context of the\n+script. The variables will override any variable previously defined in the session. When the script is completed, all local variables\n+defined will be destroyed. This ensures users do not override their session variables by accident when running `RUN SCRIPT` commands.\n+\n+#### The SOURCE command\n+\n+To allow users load variables and keep their scope in the session, then the new `SOURCE` command will be added. This will override\n+any previously defined variables, and will be destroyed until the user leaves the session.\n+\n+Syntax:\n+```\n+SOURCE '<script_file>';\n+```\n+\n+The `SOURCE` command will work like a `RUN SCRIPT`. If other SQL statements are in the file, then those statements will also be\n+executed, thus to avoid limiting users from using DDL/DML commands while defining variables at the same time from one single script.\n+\n+`SOURCE` will be used only on the CLI and headless mode. REST API will not accept it because files may be out of the scope of the server filesystem.\n+\n+### 3. Referencing substitution variables\n+\n+Variables will be referenced by wrapping the variable between `${}` characters (i.e. `${replicas}`).\n+\n+Noe: We need to make changes in QTT tests to use `${}` references instead of `{}` for consistency.\n+\n+Example:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE format = 'AVRO';\n+ksql> DEFINE replicas = '3';\n+ksql> CREATE STREAM stream1 (id INT) WITH (kafka_topic='stream1', value_format='${format}', replicas=${replicas});\n+```\n+\n+Substitution will not attempt to add single-quotes to the values. Users will need to know the data type to use when using a variable. The ksqlDB\n+server will be in charge of parsing and failing if the type is not allowed.\n+\n+Note: Variables are case-insensitive. A reference to `${replicas}` is the same as `${REPLICAS}`.\n+\n+### 4. Context for substitution variables\n+\n+Variable substitution will be allowed in specific SQL statements.

Syntax\n+\n+#### New syntax decision\n+\n+ksqlDB has a syntax to SET server and CLI properties. The use is `SET` for server properties, and `SET CLI` for CLI settings.\n+\n+For instance:\n+```\n+ksql> SET 'auto.offset.reset' = 'earliest';\n+ksql> SET CLI WRAP OFF;\n+```\n+\n+The quickest assumption is that we can use `SET` for user variables as well. But, we cannot re-use any of the above syntax because\n+of conflicts with current server and CLI setting names. So a new keyword must be use.\n+\n+Some ideas:\n+```\n+SET LOCAL   var1 = 'val1';\n+SET SESSION var1 = 'val1';\n+SET VAR     var1 = 'val1';\n+```\n+\n+`LOCAL` is confusing for users coming from other DBs environments. `LOCAL` is used to keep the scope on per-transaction basis. After a statement\n+is executed, the variable is destroyed.\n+\n+`SESSION` may be also confusing. `SESSION` is used on other DBs to override system variables for that session only. System variables are like ksqlDB\n+server properties.\n+\n+`VAR` seems a better name.\n+\n+However, we're now overloading the use of `SET` statements. For instance, in the future, we might want to use `SET ROLE`  to set the current role\n+fo the user when interacting with an RBAC server. But, if we want to print variable information, how would we do it?\n+```\n+SET VAR var1;  # prints var1 name\n+SET VAR;       # lists all variables\n+SET;           # what to do? lists all server, cli, variables, etc?\n+```\n+\n+Also, the use of single-quotes in `SET` server settings is tedious to type. So after removing them, we'll have two different sets:\n+* `SET 'server_property' = 'server_value'`\n+* `SET VAR variable = `variable_value'\n+\n+This looks confusing too. So we have to decide for a new syntax for substitution variables.\n+\n+Other DBs use different syntax to create user variables (DECLARE, DEFINE, \\set, SET). For ksqlDB, I'll choose to use `DEFINE` and `UNDEFINE` which\n+is what Oracle SQL*plus uses. Any user coming from this DB will immediately understand the command.  \n+This is opened to discussion, but will continue with this for now.\n+\n+#### Creating and printing substitution variables\n+\n+The command to interact with substitution variables is `DEFINE`.  \n+`DEFINE` will allow us to define a new variable, print the variable value and list all current defined variables.\n+\n+Syntax:\n+```\n+DEFINE [name [= 'value']];\n+\n+Where: \n+  name     is the variable name to define\n+  value    is the variable value\n+```\n+Valid variables names start with a letter or underscore (\\_) followed by zero or more alphanumeric characters or underscores.\n+\n+All variable values need to be wrapped using single quotes.

Syntax\n+\n+#### New syntax decision\n+\n+ksqlDB has a syntax to SET server and CLI properties. The use is `SET` for server properties, and `SET CLI` for CLI settings.\n+\n+For instance:\n+```\n+ksql> SET 'auto.offset.reset' = 'earliest';\n+ksql> SET CLI WRAP OFF;\n+```\n+\n+The quickest assumption is that we can use `SET` for user variables as well. But, we cannot re-use any of the above syntax because\n+of conflicts with current server and CLI setting names. So a new keyword must be use.\n+\n+Some ideas:\n+```\n+SET LOCAL   var1 = 'val1';\n+SET SESSION var1 = 'val1';\n+SET VAR     var1 = 'val1';\n+```\n+\n+`LOCAL` is confusing for users coming from other DBs environments. `LOCAL` is used to keep the scope on per-transaction basis. After a statement\n+is executed, the variable is destroyed.\n+\n+`SESSION` may be also confusing. `SESSION` is used on other DBs to override system variables for that session only. System variables are like ksqlDB\n+server properties.\n+\n+`VAR` seems a better name.\n+\n+However, we're now overloading the use of `SET` statements. For instance, in the future, we might want to use `SET ROLE`  to set the current role\n+fo the user when interacting with an RBAC server. But, if we want to print variable information, how would we do it?\n+```\n+SET VAR var1;  # prints var1 name\n+SET VAR;       # lists all variables\n+SET;           # what to do? lists all server, cli, variables, etc?\n+```\n+\n+Also, the use of single-quotes in `SET` server settings is tedious to type. So after removing them, we'll have two different sets:\n+* `SET 'server_property' = 'server_value'`\n+* `SET VAR variable = `variable_value'\n+\n+This looks confusing too. So we have to decide for a new syntax for substitution variables.\n+\n+Other DBs use different syntax to create user variables (DECLARE, DEFINE, \\set, SET). For ksqlDB, I'll choose to use `DEFINE` and `UNDEFINE` which\n+is what Oracle SQL*plus uses. Any user coming from this DB will immediately understand the command.  \n+This is opened to discussion, but will continue with this for now.\n+\n+#### Creating and printing substitution variables\n+\n+The command to interact with substitution variables is `DEFINE`.  \n+`DEFINE` will allow us to define a new variable, print the variable value and list all current defined variables.\n+\n+Syntax:\n+```\n+DEFINE [name [= 'value']];\n+\n+Where: \n+  name     is the variable name to define\n+  value    is the variable value\n+```\n+Valid variables names start with a letter or underscore (\\_) followed by zero or more alphanumeric characters or underscores.\n+\n+All variable values need to be wrapped using single quotes. All variables are stored as string values in memory, and when\n+replaced, the value without the quotes will be used. ksqlDB parsing will be in charge of determining the format at that\n+time.\n+\n+The reason not to remove single-quotes from values is to allow spaces, and to leave the syntax open for using data types in the future if required.  \n+Also, having decide the format at run-time (i.e. `define n = 3.34238`) is tricky as we could lose precision in case of decimals. Better stay with Strings for now.\n+\n+Define a new variable:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE replicas = '3';\n+ksql> DEFINE partitions = '5';\n+```\n+\n+Print a defined variable value:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE replicas;\n+DEFINE replicas   = '3'\n+```\n+\n+List all defined variables:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE;\n+DEFINE replicas   = '3'\n+DEFINE partitions = '5'\n+```\n+\n+#### Deleting substitution variables\n+\n+The `UNDEFINE` command deletes the variable.\n+\n+Syntax:\n+```\n+UNDEFINE name;\n+```\n+\n+### 2. Scope\n+\n+This variable has a session scope.\n+\n+Variables will live during the session of a ksqlDB connection, then destroyed when the connection is closed. Only the user\n+in that session can interact with the defined substitution variables. No other users can interact with other users' variables.\n+\n+In CLI, the session is opened when starting the CLI with the `ksql` command, and destroyed when typing `exit`.\n+\n+In Java API client, the session is opened when `Client.create()` is called, and closed when `Client.close()` is called. Variables\n+may be defined using a client method instead of a new syntax. This is to ensure users know the scope starts after the `create()` call.\n+\n+TBD: Define a Java API method for variable substitution.\n+\n+In headless, the session is opened when starting the ksqlDB server with a SQL script. The variables stay alive until the server is\n+killed.\n+\n+Variables are not persisted anywhere. They are living in memory as long as the session is not terminated.\n+\n+#### RUN SCRIPT command\n+\n+If a `RUN SCRIPT` command is executed in a CLI session, then any variable defined there will be local to the execution context of the\n+script. The variables will override any variable previously defined in the session. When the script is completed, all local variables\n+defined will be destroyed. This ensures users do not override their session variables by accident when running `RUN SCRIPT` commands.\n+\n+#### The SOURCE command\n+\n+To allow users load variables and keep their scope in the session, then the new `SOURCE` command will be added.

Syntax\n+\n+#### New syntax decision\n+\n+ksqlDB has a syntax to SET server and CLI properties. The use is `SET` for server properties, and `SET CLI` for CLI settings.\n+\n+For instance:\n+```\n+ksql> SET 'auto.offset.reset' = 'earliest';\n+ksql> SET CLI WRAP OFF;\n+```\n+\n+The quickest assumption is that we can use `SET` for user variables as well. But, we cannot re-use any of the above syntax because\n+of conflicts with current server and CLI setting names. So a new keyword must be use.\n+\n+Some ideas:\n+```\n+SET LOCAL   var1 = 'val1';\n+SET SESSION var1 = 'val1';\n+SET VAR     var1 = 'val1';\n+```\n+\n+`LOCAL` is confusing for users coming from other DBs environments. `LOCAL` is used to keep the scope on per-transaction basis. After a statement\n+is executed, the variable is destroyed.\n+\n+`SESSION` may be also confusing. `SESSION` is used on other DBs to override system variables for that session only. System variables are like ksqlDB\n+server properties.\n+\n+`VAR` seems a better name.\n+\n+However, we're now overloading the use of `SET` statements. For instance, in the future, we might want to use `SET ROLE`  to set the current role\n+fo the user when interacting with an RBAC server. But, if we want to print variable information, how would we do it?\n+```\n+SET VAR var1;  # prints var1 name\n+SET VAR;       # lists all variables\n+SET;           # what to do? lists all server, cli, variables, etc?\n+```\n+\n+Also, the use of single-quotes in `SET` server settings is tedious to type. So after removing them, we'll have two different sets:\n+* `SET 'server_property' = 'server_value'`\n+* `SET VAR variable = `variable_value'\n+\n+This looks confusing too. So we have to decide for a new syntax for substitution variables.\n+\n+Other DBs use different syntax to create user variables (DECLARE, DEFINE, \\set, SET). For ksqlDB, I'll choose to use `DEFINE` and `UNDEFINE` which\n+is what Oracle SQL*plus uses. Any user coming from this DB will immediately understand the command.  \n+This is opened to discussion, but will continue with this for now.\n+\n+#### Creating and printing substitution variables\n+\n+The command to interact with substitution variables is `DEFINE`.  \n+`DEFINE` will allow us to define a new variable, print the variable value and list all current defined variables.\n+\n+Syntax:\n+```\n+DEFINE [name [= 'value']];\n+\n+Where: \n+  name     is the variable name to define\n+  value    is the variable value\n+```\n+Valid variables names start with a letter or underscore (\\_) followed by zero or more alphanumeric characters or underscores.\n+\n+All variable values need to be wrapped using single quotes. All variables are stored as string values in memory, and when\n+replaced, the value without the quotes will be used. ksqlDB parsing will be in charge of determining the format at that\n+time.\n+\n+The reason not to remove single-quotes from values is to allow spaces, and to leave the syntax open for using data types in the future if required.  \n+Also, having decide the format at run-time (i.e. `define n = 3.34238`) is tricky as we could lose precision in case of decimals. Better stay with Strings for now.\n+\n+Define a new variable:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE replicas = '3';\n+ksql> DEFINE partitions = '5';\n+```\n+\n+Print a defined variable value:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE replicas;\n+DEFINE replicas   = '3'\n+```\n+\n+List all defined variables:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE;\n+DEFINE replicas   = '3'\n+DEFINE partitions = '5'\n+```\n+\n+#### Deleting substitution variables\n+\n+The `UNDEFINE` command deletes the variable.\n+\n+Syntax:\n+```\n+UNDEFINE name;\n+```\n+\n+### 2. Scope\n+\n+This variable has a session scope.\n+\n+Variables will live during the session of a ksqlDB connection, then destroyed when the connection is closed. Only the user\n+in that session can interact with the defined substitution variables. No other users can interact with other users' variables.\n+\n+In CLI, the session is opened when starting the CLI with the `ksql` command, and destroyed when typing `exit`.\n+\n+In Java API client, the session is opened when `Client.create()` is called, and closed when `Client.close()` is called. Variables\n+may be defined using a client method instead of a new syntax. This is to ensure users know the scope starts after the `create()` call.\n+\n+TBD: Define a Java API method for variable substitution.\n+\n+In headless, the session is opened when starting the ksqlDB server with a SQL script. The variables stay alive until the server is\n+killed.\n+\n+Variables are not persisted anywhere. They are living in memory as long as the session is not terminated.\n+\n+#### RUN SCRIPT command\n+\n+If a `RUN SCRIPT` command is executed in a CLI session, then any variable defined there will be local to the execution context of the\n+script. The variables will override any variable previously defined in the session. When the script is completed, all local variables\n+defined will be destroyed. This ensures users do not override their session variables by accident when running `RUN SCRIPT` commands.\n+\n+#### The SOURCE command\n+\n+To allow users load variables and keep their scope in the session, then the new `SOURCE` command will be added. This will override\n+any previously defined variables, and will be destroyed until the user leaves the session.\n+\n+Syntax:\n+```\n+SOURCE '<script_file>';\n+```\n+\n+The `SOURCE` command will work like a `RUN SCRIPT`. If other SQL statements are in the file, then those statements will also be\n+executed, thus to avoid limiting users from using DDL/DML commands while defining variables at the same time from one single script.\n+\n+`SOURCE` will be used only on the CLI and headless mode. REST API will not accept it because files may be out of the scope of the server filesystem.\n+\n+### 3. Referencing substitution variables\n+\n+Variables will be referenced by wrapping the variable between `${}` characters (i.e. `${replicas}`).\n+\n+Noe: We need to make changes in QTT tests to use `${}` references instead of `{}` for consistency.\n+\n+Example:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE format = 'AVRO';\n+ksql> DEFINE replicas = '3';\n+ksql> CREATE STREAM stream1 (id INT) WITH (kafka_topic='stream1', value_format='${format}', replicas=${replicas});\n+```\n+\n+Substitution will not attempt to add single-quotes to the values. Users will need to know the data type to use when using a variable. The ksqlDB\n+server will be in charge of parsing and failing if the type is not allowed.\n+\n+Note: Variables are case-insensitive. A reference to `${replicas}` is the same as `${REPLICAS}`.\n+\n+### 4. Context for substitution variables\n+\n+Variable substitution will be allowed in specific SQL statements.

Syntax\n+\n+#### New syntax decision\n+\n+ksqlDB has a syntax to SET server and CLI properties. The use is `SET` for server properties, and `SET CLI` for CLI settings.\n+\n+For instance:\n+```\n+ksql> SET 'auto.offset.reset' = 'earliest';\n+ksql> SET CLI WRAP OFF;\n+```\n+\n+The quickest assumption is that we can use `SET` for user variables as well. But, we cannot re-use any of the above syntax because\n+of conflicts with current server and CLI setting names. So a new keyword must be use.\n+\n+Some ideas:\n+```\n+SET LOCAL   var1 = 'val1';\n+SET SESSION var1 = 'val1';\n+SET VAR     var1 = 'val1';\n+```\n+\n+`LOCAL` is confusing for users coming from other DBs environments. `LOCAL` is used to keep the scope on per-transaction basis. After a statement\n+is executed, the variable is destroyed.\n+\n+`SESSION` may be also confusing. `SESSION` is used on other DBs to override system variables for that session only. System variables are like ksqlDB\n+server properties.\n+\n+`VAR` seems a better name.\n+\n+However, we're now overloading the use of `SET` statements. For instance, in the future, we might want to use `SET ROLE`  to set the current role\n+fo the user when interacting with an RBAC server. But, if we want to print variable information, how would we do it?\n+```\n+SET VAR var1;  # prints var1 name\n+SET VAR;       # lists all variables\n+SET;           # what to do? lists all server, cli, variables, etc?\n+```\n+\n+Also, the use of single-quotes in `SET` server settings is tedious to type. So after removing them, we'll have two different sets:\n+* `SET 'server_property' = 'server_value'`\n+* `SET VAR variable = `variable_value'\n+\n+This looks confusing too. So we have to decide for a new syntax for substitution variables.\n+\n+Other DBs use different syntax to create user variables (DECLARE, DEFINE, \\set, SET). For ksqlDB, I'll choose to use `DEFINE` and `UNDEFINE` which\n+is what Oracle SQL*plus uses. Any user coming from this DB will immediately understand the command.  \n+This is opened to discussion, but will continue with this for now.\n+\n+#### Creating and printing substitution variables\n+\n+The command to interact with substitution variables is `DEFINE`.  \n+`DEFINE` will allow us to define a new variable, print the variable value and list all current defined variables.\n+\n+Syntax:\n+```\n+DEFINE [name [= 'value']];\n+\n+Where: \n+  name     is the variable name to define\n+  value    is the variable value\n+```\n+Valid variables names start with a letter or underscore (\\_) followed by zero or more alphanumeric characters or underscores.\n+\n+All variable values need to be wrapped using single quotes.

Scope\n+\n+This variable has a session scope.\n+\n+Variables will live during the session of a ksqlDB connection, then destroyed when the connection is closed. Only the user\n+in that session can interact with the defined substitution variables. No other users can interact with other users' variables.\n+\n+In CLI, the session is opened when starting the CLI with the `ksql` command, and destroyed when typing `exit`.\n+\n+In Java API client, the session is opened when `Client.create()` is called, and closed when `Client.close()` is called. Variables\n+may be defined using a client method instead of a new syntax. This is to ensure users know the scope starts after the `create()` call.\n+\n+TBD: Define a Java API method for variable substitution.\n+\n+In headless, the session is opened when starting the ksqlDB server with a SQL script. The variables stay alive until the server is\n+killed.\n+\n+Variables are not persisted anywhere. They are living in memory as long as the session is not terminated.\n+\n+#### RUN SCRIPT command\n+\n+If a `RUN SCRIPT` command is executed in a CLI session, then any variable defined there will be local to the execution context of the\n+script. The variables will override any variable previously defined in the session. When the script is completed, all local variables\n+defined will be destroyed. This ensures users do not override their session variables by accident when running `RUN SCRIPT` commands.\n+\n+#### The SOURCE command\n+\n+To allow users load variables and keep their scope in the session, then the new `SOURCE` command will be added. This will override\n+any previously defined variables, and will be destroyed until the user leaves the session.\n+\n+Syntax:\n+```\n+SOURCE '<script_file>';\n+```\n+\n+The `SOURCE` command will work like a `RUN SCRIPT`. If other SQL statements are in the file, then those statements will also be\n+executed, thus to avoid limiting users from using DDL/DML commands while defining variables at the same time from one single script.\n+\n+`SOURCE` will be used only on the CLI and headless mode. REST API will not accept it because files may be out of the scope of the server filesystem.\n+\n+### 3. Referencing substitution variables\n+\n+Variables will be referenced by wrapping the variable between `${}` characters (i.e. `${replicas}`).\n+\n+Noe: We need to make changes in QTT tests to use `${}` references instead of `{}` for consistency.\n+\n+Example:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE format = 'AVRO';\n+ksql> DEFINE replicas = '3';\n+ksql> CREATE STREAM stream1 (id INT) WITH (kafka_topic='stream1', value_format='${format}', replicas=${replicas});\n+```\n+\n+Substitution will not attempt to add single-quotes to the values. Users will need to know the data type to use when using a variable. The ksqlDB\n+server will be in charge of parsing and failing if the type is not allowed.\n+\n+Note: Variables are case-insensitive. A reference to `${replicas}` is the same as `${REPLICAS}`.\n+\n+### 4. Context for substitution variables\n+\n+Variable substitution will be allowed in specific SQL statements.

Any user coming from this DB will immediately understand the command.  \n+This is opened to discussion, but will continue with this for now.\n+\n+#### Creating and printing substitution variables\n+\n+The command to interact with substitution variables is `DEFINE`.  \n+`DEFINE` will allow us to define a new variable, print the variable value and list all current defined variables.\n+\n+Syntax:\n+```\n+DEFINE [name [= 'value']];\n+\n+Where: \n+  name     is the variable name to define\n+  value    is the variable value\n+```\n+Valid variables names start with a letter or underscore (\\_) followed by zero or more alphanumeric characters or underscores.\n+\n+All variable values need to be wrapped using single quotes. All variables are stored as string values in memory, and when\n+replaced, the value without the quotes will be used. ksqlDB parsing will be in charge of determining the format at that\n+time.\n+\n+The reason not to remove single-quotes from values is to allow spaces, and to leave the syntax open for using data types in the future if required.  \n+Also, having decide the format at run-time (i.e. `define n = 3.34238`) is tricky as we could lose precision in case of decimals. Better stay with Strings for now.\n+\n+Define a new variable:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE replicas = '3';\n+ksql> DEFINE partitions = '5';\n+```\n+\n+Print a defined variable value:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE replicas;\n+DEFINE replicas   = '3'\n+```\n+\n+List all defined variables:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE;\n+DEFINE replicas   = '3'\n+DEFINE partitions = '5'\n+```\n+\n+#### Deleting substitution variables\n+\n+The `UNDEFINE` command deletes the variable.\n+\n+Syntax:\n+```\n+UNDEFINE name;\n+```\n+\n+### 2. Scope\n+\n+This variable has a session scope.\n+\n+Variables will live during the session of a ksqlDB connection, then destroyed when the connection is closed. Only the user\n+in that session can interact with the defined substitution variables. No other users can interact with other users' variables.\n+\n+In CLI, the session is opened when starting the CLI with the `ksql` command, and destroyed when typing `exit`.\n+\n+In Java API client, the session is opened when `Client.create()` is called, and closed when `Client.close()` is called. Variables\n+may be defined using a client method instead of a new syntax. This is to ensure users know the scope starts after the `create()` call.\n+\n+TBD: Define a Java API method for variable substitution.\n+\n+In headless, the session is opened when starting the ksqlDB server with a SQL script. The variables stay alive until the server is\n+killed.\n+\n+Variables are not persisted anywhere. They are living in memory as long as the session is not terminated.\n+\n+#### RUN SCRIPT command\n+\n+If a `RUN SCRIPT` command is executed in a CLI session, then any variable defined there will be local to the execution context of the\n+script. The variables will override any variable previously defined in the session. When the script is completed, all local variables\n+defined will be destroyed. This ensures users do not override their session variables by accident when running `RUN SCRIPT` commands.\n+\n+#### The SOURCE command\n+\n+To allow users load variables and keep their scope in the session, then the new `SOURCE` command will be added. This will override\n+any previously defined variables, and will be destroyed until the user leaves the session.\n+\n+Syntax:\n+```\n+SOURCE '<script_file>';\n+```\n+\n+The `SOURCE` command will work like a `RUN SCRIPT`. If other SQL statements are in the file, then those statements will also be\n+executed, thus to avoid limiting users from using DDL/DML commands while defining variables at the same time from one single script.\n+\n+`SOURCE` will be used only on the CLI and headless mode. REST API will not accept it because files may be out of the scope of the server filesystem.\n+\n+### 3. Referencing substitution variables\n+\n+Variables will be referenced by wrapping the variable between `${}` characters (i.e. `${replicas}`).\n+\n+Noe: We need to make changes in QTT tests to use `${}` references instead of `{}` for consistency.\n+\n+Example:\n+```\n+ksql> DEFINE format = 'AVRO';\n+ksql> DEFINE replicas = '3';\n+ksql> CREATE STREAM stream1 (id INT) WITH (kafka_topic='stream1', value_format='${format}', replicas=${replicas});\n+```\n+\n+Substitution will not attempt to add single-quotes to the values. Users will need to know the data type to use when using a variable. The ksqlDB\n+server will be in charge of parsing and failing if the type is not allowed.\n+\n+Note: Variables are case-insensitive. A reference to `${replicas}` is the same as `${REPLICAS}`.\n+\n+### 4. Context for substitution variables\n+\n+Variable substitution will be allowed in specific SQL statements. They can be used to replace text and non-text literals, and identifiers such as\n+column names and stream/table names. Variables cannot be used as reserved keywords.\n+\n+For instance:\n+\n+Note: `{VAR}` is used a reference where variables are permitted.\n+```\n+ksql> CREATE STREAM ${streamName} (${colName1} INT, ${colName2} STRING) \\\n+      WITH (kafka_topic='${topicName}', format='${format}', replicas=${replicas}, ...);\n+      \n+ksql> INSERT INTO ${streamName} (${colName1}, ${colName2}) \\\n+      VALUES (${val1}, '${val2}');\n+\n+ksql> SELECT * FROM ${streamName} \\\n+      WHERE ${colName1} == ${val1} and ${colName2} == '${val2}' EMIT CHANGES; \n+```\n+Any attempt of using variables on non-permitted places will fail with the current SQL parsing error found when parsing the variable string.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "57d885e63b31382fb53f1b6ff77521296fc3963a"}, "originalPosition": 227}]}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 2809, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-12T19:05:54Z"}}}
