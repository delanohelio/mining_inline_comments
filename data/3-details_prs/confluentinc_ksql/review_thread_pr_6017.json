The only area where additional work is expected is joins.\n+\n+Joins require the binary key of both sides of the join to match and both sides to be delivered to \n+the same ksqlDB node.  The former normally ensuring the latter, unless a custom partitioning \n+strategy has been used.\n+\n+The introduction of additional key formats means that while the deserialized key from both sides of \n+a join may match, the serialized binary data may differ if the key serialization format is different.\n+To accommodate this, ksqlDB will automagically repartition the right side of a join to match the key\n+format of the left side.  Such repartitioning is possible and safe, even for tables, because the \n+logical key of the data will not have changed, only the serialization format. This ensures the \n+ordering of updates to a specific key are maintained across the repartition.\n+\n+## Test plan\n+\n+Aside from the usual unit tests etc, the QTT suit of tests will be extended to cover the different\n+key formats. Tests will be added to cover the new syntax and configuration combinations and \n+permutations. Existing tests covering aggregations, re-partitions and joins will be extended to \n+include variants with different key formats. \n+\n+## LOEs and Delivery Milestones\n+\n+The KLIP will be broken down into the following deliverables:\n+\n+1. **Basic JSON support**: Support for the `JSON` key format, without:\n+    * schema registry integration\n+    * making KAFKA_TOPIC property optional\n+    * Automatic repartitioning of streams and tables for joins where key formats do not match: such\n+      joins will result in an error initially.\n+  \n+    Included in this milestone:\n+    \n+    * Addition of a new optional `KEY_FORMAT` property in the `WITH` clause, to set the key format.\n+    * Addition of a new optional `FORMAT` property in the `WITH` clause, to set both the key & value formats.\n+    * Addition of new server configuration to provide defaults for key and value formats.\n+    * Removal of requirement for `VALUE_FORMAT` property in the `WITH` clause of CT/CS statements, where\n+      the server configuration provides a default.\n+    * Support for additional key column data types, as JSON supports them:\n+        * `DECIMAL`\n+        * `BOOLEAN`\n+    * Full support of these key formats for all supported SQL syntax  \n+1. **Auto-repartitioning on key format mismatch**. Adds support for automatic repartitioning of \n+   streams and tables for joins where key formats do not match.\n+1. **Schema Registry support**: Adds support for reading and writing schemas to and from the schema\n+   registry.\n+1. **JSON_SR support** Adds support for the `AVRO` key format, inc. schema registry integration.\n+1. **Avro support** Adds support for the `AVRO` key format, inc. schema registry integration.\n+1. **Delimited support**: Adds support for the `DELIMITED` key format.\n+1. **Optional KAFKA_TOPIC property**: makes the `KAFKA_TOPIC` property optional everywhere and add\n+   configuration to control case and case sensitivity of topic names.\n+1. **Blog post**: write a blog post about the new features. (Potentially more than once if \n+  work span multiple releases).\n+   \n+LOE TBD once scope and design confirmed.\n+\n+## Documentation Updates\n+\n+New server config and new `CREATE` properties will be added to main docs site.\n+\n+There are no incompatible changes within the proposal, so no demos and examples _must_ change.\n+However, it probably pays to update some to highlight the new features. We propose updating the \n+Kafka micro site examples to leverage the new functionality, as these have automated testing.  \n+It may be worth changing the ksqlDB quickstart too - TBD, as this will require extending DataGen \n+to support other key formats.

The only area where additional work is expected is joins.\n+\n+Joins require the binary key of both sides of the join to match and both sides to be delivered to \n+the same ksqlDB node.  The former normally ensuring the latter, unless a custom partitioning \n+strategy has been used.\n+\n+The introduction of additional key formats means that while the deserialized key from both sides of \n+a join may match, the serialized binary data may differ if the key serialization format is different.\n+To accommodate this, ksqlDB will automagically repartition the right side of a join to match the key\n+format of the left side.  Such repartitioning is possible and safe, even for tables, because the \n+logical key of the data will not have changed, only the serialization format. This ensures the \n+ordering of updates to a specific key are maintained across the repartition.\n+\n+## Test plan\n+\n+Aside from the usual unit tests etc, the QTT suit of tests will be extended to cover the different\n+key formats. Tests will be added to cover the new syntax and configuration combinations and \n+permutations. Existing tests covering aggregations, re-partitions and joins will be extended to \n+include variants with different key formats. \n+\n+## LOEs and Delivery Milestones\n+\n+The KLIP will be broken down into the following deliverables:\n+\n+1. **Basic JSON support**: Support for the `JSON` key format, without:\n+    * schema registry integration\n+    * making KAFKA_TOPIC property optional\n+    * Automatic repartitioning of streams and tables for joins where key formats do not match: such\n+      joins will result in an error initially.\n+  \n+    Included in this milestone:\n+    \n+    * Addition of a new optional `KEY_FORMAT` property in the `WITH` clause, to set the key format.\n+    * Addition of a new optional `FORMAT` property in the `WITH` clause, to set both the key & value formats.\n+    * Addition of new server configuration to provide defaults for key and value formats.\n+    * Removal of requirement for `VALUE_FORMAT` property in the `WITH` clause of CT/CS statements, where\n+      the server configuration provides a default.\n+    * Support for additional key column data types, as JSON supports them:\n+        * `DECIMAL`\n+        * `BOOLEAN`\n+    * Full support of these key formats for all supported SQL syntax  \n+1. **Auto-repartitioning on key format mismatch**. Adds support for automatic repartitioning of \n+   streams and tables for joins where key formats do not match.\n+1. **Schema Registry support**: Adds support for reading and writing schemas to and from the schema\n+   registry.\n+1. **JSON_SR support** Adds support for the `AVRO` key format, inc. schema registry integration.\n+1. **Avro support** Adds support for the `AVRO` key format, inc. schema registry integration.\n+1. **Delimited support**: Adds support for the `DELIMITED` key format.\n+1. **Optional KAFKA_TOPIC property**: makes the `KAFKA_TOPIC` property optional everywhere and add\n+   configuration to control case and case sensitivity of topic names.\n+1. **Blog post**: write a blog post about the new features. (Potentially more than once if \n+  work span multiple releases).\n+   \n+LOE TBD once scope and design confirmed.\n+\n+## Documentation Updates\n+\n+New server config and new `CREATE` properties will be added to main docs site.\n+\n+There are no incompatible changes within the proposal, so no demos and examples _must_ change.\n+However, it probably pays to update some to highlight the new features. We propose updating the \n+Kafka micro site examples to leverage the new functionality, as these have automated testing.  \n+It may be worth changing the ksqlDB quickstart too - TBD, as this will require extending DataGen \n+to support other key formats. Something we may want in scope anyway - or should be end-of-life \n+DataGen in favour of the datagen connector?\n+\n+## Compatibility Implications\n+\n+As mentioned above, existing query plays already include key formats for all topics. So existing\n+queries will continue to work.\n+\n+Without `ksql.persistence.default.format.key` set to `KAFKA` existing queries in the form:\n+\n+```sql\n+CREATE TABLE USERS (\n+    ID BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,\n+    NAME STRING\n+  ) WITH (\n+    KAFKA_TOPIC='USERS',\n+    VALUE_FORMAT='JSON'\n+  );\n+```\n+\n+...will start failing, as they do not specify the `KEY_FORMAT`.

This limits the\n+           data ksqlDB can work with. Extending the set of key formats ksqlDB supports immediately\n+           opens up the use of ksqlDB with previously incompatible datasets.\n+           \n+## Motivation and background\n+\n+Data stored in Kafka has a key and a value. These can be serialized using different formats, but are\n+generally use a common format. ksqlDB supports multiple _value_ [data formats][1], but requires the \n+key data format to be the `KAFKA`.  \n+\n+This limitation is particularly problematic for tables. ksqlDB is unable to access changelog topics\n+in Kafka that have non-`KAFKA` formatted keys. As the key of the Kafka record is the `PRIMARY KEY` \n+of the table, it is essential that the key can be read if the changelog is to be materialised into a \n+table. When changelog topics have non-`KAFKA` key formats, the limitation precludes ksqlDB as a solution.\n+\n+The limitation is less damaging for streams. However, it is still the case that the user looses the\n+ability to access the data in the Kafka record's key. If this data is not duplicated in the record's\n+value, which generally seems to be the case, then the data is not accessible at all. If the data is\n+required, then the limitation precludes ksqlDB as a solution.\n+\n+As well as unsupported _input_ key formats, ksqlDB is equally precluded should a solution require the \n+_output_ to have a non-`KAFKA` key format. ksqlDB is already often used as the glue between \n+disparate systems, even though it is limited to changing the _values_ format and structure.\n+Supporting other key formats opens this up to also transforming the key into a different format. \n+\n+In some cases users are able to work around this limitation. This may involve changing upstream code,\n+or introducing pre-processing, or, in the case of Connect, using SMTs to convert the key format. All\n+such solutions tend to increase the complexity of the system, and generally hurt performance.\n+\n+To open ksqlDB up to new problems spaces and to drive adoption, ksqlDB should support other key formats. \n+\n+## What is in scope\n+\n+ * Addition of a new optional `KEY_FORMAT` property in the `WITH` clause, to set the key format.\n+ * Addition of a new optional `FORMAT` property in the `WITH` clause, to set both the key & value formats.\n+ * Addition of new server configuration to provide defaults for key and value formats.\n+ * Removal of requirement for `VALUE_FORMAT` property in the `WITH` clause of CT/CS statements, where\n+   the server configuration provides a default.\n+ * Support for additional key column data types, where the key format supports it:\n+    * `DECIMAL`\n+    * `BOOLEAN`\n+ * Support of the following key formats:\n+    * `DELIMITED`: single key columns as a single string value.\n+    * `JSON`: single key column as an anonymous value, i.e. not within a JSON object.\n+    * `AVRO`: single key column as an anonymous value, i.e. not within an Avro record.\n+  * Full support of these key formats for all supported SQL syntax.\n+  * Automatic repartitioning of streams and tables for joins where key formats do not match.\n+  * Support for reading & writing key schemas to & from the schema registry. \n+\n+## What is not in scope\n+\n+ * Support for multiple key columns: this will come later.\n+ * Support for single key columns _wrapped_ in an envelope of some kind: this will come later.\n+ * Support for complex key column data types, i.e. array, struct and map \n+ * Support for `PROTOBUF` keys, as this requires support for wrapped keys: this will come later.\n+\n+## Value/Return\n+\n+We know from customers and community members that there are a lot of people that have data with \n+non-`KAFKA` formatted keys.

Providing `FORMAT` along with either \n+`KEY_FORMAT` or `VALUE_FORMAT` will result in an error.\n+\n+The key format will follow the same inheritance rules as the current value format. Namely: any \n+derived stream will inherit the format of its leftmost source, unless the format is explicitly set\n+in the with clause.\n+\n+For example:\n+\n+```sql\n+-- Creates a table over a changelog topic with AVRO key and JSON value:\n+CREATE TABLE USERS (\n+    ID BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,\n+    NAME STRING\n+  ) WITH (\n+    KAFKA_TOPIC='USERS',\n+    KEY_FORMAT='AVRO',\n+    VALUE_FORMAT='JSON'\n+  );\n+\n+-- Creates a stream over a topic with JSON key and value:\n+CREATE STREAM BIDS (\n+    ITEM_ID BIGINT KEY,\n+    USER_ID BIGINT,\n+    AMMOUNT INT\n+  ) WITH (\n+    KAFKA_TOPIC='USERS',\n+    FORMAT='JSON'\n+  );\n+\n+-- Change the key format of a stream:\n+CREATE STREAM AVRP_BIDS \n+  WITH WITH (\n+    KEY_FORMAT='AVRO'\n+  ) AS\n+    SELECT * FROM BIDS;\n+\n+-- Creates an enriched stream. The key format is inherited from the leftmost source, i.e. JSON:\n+CREATE STREAM ENRICHED_BIDS AS \n+  SELECT *\n+  FROM BIDS \n+   JOIN USERS ON BIDS.USER_ID = USERS.ID;\n+```\n+\n+For formats that support integration with the schema registry, the key schema will be read and \n+registered with the Schema Registry as needed, following the same pattern as the value schema in \n+the current product.\n+\n+### New server config\n+\n+In addition to new `CREATE` properties, the user will also be able to set default key and value \n+formats using system configuration. \n+\n+`KEY_FORMAT` will not be a required property _if_ `ksql.persistence.default.format.key` is set. \n+`VALUE_FORMAT` is currently a required property, but will no longer be required _if_ \n+`ksql.persistence.default.format.value` is set.\n+\n+Somewhat unrelated, but small, we propose also changing the `KAFKA_TOPIC` property from _required_ to \n+_optional_ in `CREATE STREAM` and `CREATE TABLE` statements. If not supplied, it will default to the \n+uppercase name of the stream or table.  This matches the behaviour of the property in \n+`CREATE STREAM AS SELECT` and `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` statements, where it is already optional.\n+\n+To additional configurations will be added to control topic names:\n+\n+* `ksql.persistence.topic.name.case`: if `lower`, defaults ksql to using lowercase topics names\n+  where topic names are not explicitly provided. This includes matching a `CREATE TABLE` or \n+  `CREATE STREAM` statement to an existing topic. Default: `upper`.\n+* `ksql.persistence.topic.name.case.insensitive`: if `true`, matching a `CREATE TABLE` or \n+  `CREATE STREAM` statement to an existing topic will be case insensitive. Multiple matches will \n+  result in an error. Default: `false`.\n+\n+With these changes there will no longer be any required `CREATE` properties. This means the `WITH` \n+clause for `CREATE` statements for streams and tables would be optional. We propose this makes the \n+syntax more intuitive for those already familiar with SQL. This would make a `CREATE TABLE` \n+statement ANSI standard.\n+\n+```sql\n+SET 'ksql.persistence.default.format.key'='Avro';\n+SET 'ksql.persistence.default.format.value'='Avro';\n+\n+CREATE TABLE USERS (\n+  ID BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,\n+  NAME STRING\n+);\n+\n+CREATE STREAM BIDS (\n+  ITEM_ID BIGINT KEY,\n+  USER_ID BIGINT,\n+  AMMOUNT INT\n+);\n+```\n+\n+### Implementation\n+\n+The system already serializes the key format of source, intermediate and sink topics as part of the\n+query plan, meaning it should be fairly easily to plug in new formats. \n+\n+Validation will be added to ensure only supported key formats are set, and that key column data types\n+are supported by key formats.\n+\n+Most existing functionality should _just work_, as the key format only comes into play during \n+(de)serialization, (obviously). The only area where additional work is expected is joins.\n+\n+Joins require the binary key of both sides of the join to match and both sides to be delivered to \n+the same ksqlDB node.  The former normally ensuring the latter, unless a custom partitioning \n+strategy has been used.\n+\n+The introduction of additional key formats means that while the deserialized key from both sides of \n+a join may match, the serialized binary data may differ if the key serialization format is different.\n+To accommodate this, ksqlDB will automagically repartition the right side of a join to match the key\n+format of the left side.  Such repartitioning is possible and safe, even for tables, because the \n+logical key of the data will not have changed, only the serialization format. This ensures the \n+ordering of updates to a specific key are maintained across the repartition.\n+\n+## Test plan\n+\n+Aside from the usual unit tests etc, the QTT suit of tests will be extended to cover the different\n+key formats. Tests will be added to cover the new syntax and configuration combinations and \n+permutations. Existing tests covering aggregations, re-partitions and joins will be extended to \n+include variants with different key formats. \n+\n+## LOEs and Delivery Milestones\n+\n+The KLIP will be broken down into the following deliverables:\n+\n+1. **Basic JSON support**: Support for the `JSON` key format, without:\n+    * schema registry integration\n+    * making KAFKA_TOPIC property optional\n+    * Automatic repartitioning of streams and tables for joins where key formats do not match: such\n+      joins will result in an error initially.\n+  \n+    Included in this milestone:\n+    \n+    * Addition of a new optional `KEY_FORMAT` property in the `WITH` clause, to set the key format.\n+    * Addition of a new optional `FORMAT` property in the `WITH` clause, to set both the key & value formats.\n+    * Addition of new server configuration to provide defaults for key and value formats.\n+    * Removal of requirement for `VALUE_FORMAT` property in the `WITH` clause of CT/CS statements, where\n+      the server configuration provides a default.\n+    * Support for additional key column data types, as JSON supports them:\n+        * `DECIMAL`\n+        * `BOOLEAN`\n+    * Full support of these key formats for all supported SQL syntax  \n+1. **Auto-repartitioning on key format mismatch**.

(See below).\n+\n+### Server configs\n+\n+The following new configuration options will be added. These configurations can be set globally, \n+within the application property file, or locally, via the `SET` command.\n+\n+* `ksql.persistence.default.format.key`: the default key format.\n+* `ksql.persistence.default.format.value`: the default value format.\n+\n+## Design\n+\n+### New CREATE properties\n+\n+The new `KEY_FORMAT` or `FORMAT` property will be supported where ever the current `VALUE_FORMAT` is\n+supported. Namely:\n+\n+ * In `CRREATE STREAM` and `CREATE TABLE` statements.\n+ * In `CREATE STREAM AS SELECT` and `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` statements.\n+ \n+Providing `FORMAT` will set both the key and value formats. Providing `FORMAT` along with either \n+`KEY_FORMAT` or `VALUE_FORMAT` will result in an error.\n+\n+The key format will follow the same inheritance rules as the current value format. Namely: any \n+derived stream will inherit the format of its leftmost source, unless the format is explicitly set\n+in the with clause.\n+\n+For example:\n+\n+```sql\n+-- Creates a table over a changelog topic with AVRO key and JSON value:\n+CREATE TABLE USERS (\n+    ID BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,\n+    NAME STRING\n+  ) WITH (\n+    KAFKA_TOPIC='USERS',\n+    KEY_FORMAT='AVRO',\n+    VALUE_FORMAT='JSON'\n+  );\n+\n+-- Creates a stream over a topic with JSON key and value:\n+CREATE STREAM BIDS (\n+    ITEM_ID BIGINT KEY,\n+    USER_ID BIGINT,\n+    AMMOUNT INT\n+  ) WITH (\n+    KAFKA_TOPIC='USERS',\n+    FORMAT='JSON'\n+  );\n+\n+-- Change the key format of a stream:\n+CREATE STREAM AVRP_BIDS \n+  WITH WITH (\n+    KEY_FORMAT='AVRO'\n+  ) AS\n+    SELECT * FROM BIDS;\n+\n+-- Creates an enriched stream. The key format is inherited from the leftmost source, i.e. JSON:\n+CREATE STREAM ENRICHED_BIDS AS \n+  SELECT *\n+  FROM BIDS \n+   JOIN USERS ON BIDS.USER_ID = USERS.ID;\n+```\n+\n+For formats that support integration with the schema registry, the key schema will be read and \n+registered with the Schema Registry as needed, following the same pattern as the value schema in \n+the current product.\n+\n+### New server config\n+\n+In addition to new `CREATE` properties, the user will also be able to set default key and value \n+formats using system configuration. \n+\n+`KEY_FORMAT` will not be a required property _if_ `ksql.persistence.default.format.key` is set. \n+`VALUE_FORMAT` is currently a required property, but will no longer be required _if_ \n+`ksql.persistence.default.format.value` is set.\n+\n+Somewhat unrelated, but small, we propose also changing the `KAFKA_TOPIC` property from _required_ to \n+_optional_ in `CREATE STREAM` and `CREATE TABLE` statements. If not supplied, it will default to the \n+uppercase name of the stream or table.  This matches the behaviour of the property in \n+`CREATE STREAM AS SELECT` and `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` statements, where it is already optional.\n+\n+To additional configurations will be added to control topic names:\n+\n+* `ksql.persistence.topic.name.case`: if `lower`, defaults ksql to using lowercase topics names\n+  where topic names are not explicitly provided. This includes matching a `CREATE TABLE` or \n+  `CREATE STREAM` statement to an existing topic. Default: `upper`.\n+* `ksql.persistence.topic.name.case.insensitive`: if `true`, matching a `CREATE TABLE` or \n+  `CREATE STREAM` statement to an existing topic will be case insensitive. Multiple matches will \n+  result in an error. Default: `false`.\n+\n+With these changes there will no longer be any required `CREATE` properties. This means the `WITH` \n+clause for `CREATE` statements for streams and tables would be optional. We propose this makes the \n+syntax more intuitive for those already familiar with SQL. This would make a `CREATE TABLE` \n+statement ANSI standard.\n+\n+```sql\n+SET 'ksql.persistence.default.format.key'='Avro';\n+SET 'ksql.persistence.default.format.value'='Avro';\n+\n+CREATE TABLE USERS (\n+  ID BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,\n+  NAME STRING\n+);\n+\n+CREATE STREAM BIDS (\n+  ITEM_ID BIGINT KEY,\n+  USER_ID BIGINT,\n+  AMMOUNT INT\n+);\n+```\n+\n+### Implementation\n+\n+The system already serializes the key format of source, intermediate and sink topics as part of the\n+query plan, meaning it should be fairly easily to plug in new formats. \n+\n+Validation will be added to ensure only supported key formats are set, and that key column data types\n+are supported by key formats.\n+\n+Most existing functionality should _just work_, as the key format only comes into play during \n+(de)serialization, (obviously). The only area where additional work is expected is joins.\n+\n+Joins require the binary key of both sides of the join to match and both sides to be delivered to \n+the same ksqlDB node.  The former normally ensuring the latter, unless a custom partitioning \n+strategy has been used.\n+\n+The introduction of additional key formats means that while the deserialized key from both sides of \n+a join may match, the serialized binary data may differ if the key serialization format is different.\n+To accommodate this, ksqlDB will automagically repartition the right side of a join to match the key\n+format of the left side.  Such repartitioning is possible and safe, even for tables, because the \n+logical key of the data will not have changed, only the serialization format. This ensures the \n+ordering of updates to a specific key are maintained across the repartition.\n+\n+## Test plan\n+\n+Aside from the usual unit tests etc, the QTT suit of tests will be extended to cover the different\n+key formats. Tests will be added to cover the new syntax and configuration combinations and \n+permutations. Existing tests covering aggregations, re-partitions and joins will be extended to \n+include variants with different key formats. \n+\n+## LOEs and Delivery Milestones\n+\n+The KLIP will be broken down into the following deliverables:\n+\n+1. **Basic JSON support**: Support for the `JSON` key format, without:\n+    * schema registry integration\n+    * making KAFKA_TOPIC property optional\n+    * Automatic repartitioning of streams and tables for joins where key formats do not match: such\n+      joins will result in an error initially.\n+  \n+    Included in this milestone:\n+    \n+    * Addition of a new optional `KEY_FORMAT` property in the `WITH` clause, to set the key format.\n+    * Addition of a new optional `FORMAT` property in the `WITH` clause, to set both the key & value formats.\n+    * Addition of new server configuration to provide defaults for key and value formats.\n+    * Removal of requirement for `VALUE_FORMAT` property in the `WITH` clause of CT/CS statements, where\n+      the server configuration provides a default.\n+    * Support for additional key column data types, as JSON supports them:\n+        * `DECIMAL`\n+        * `BOOLEAN`\n+    * Full support of these key formats for all supported SQL syntax  \n+1. **Auto-repartitioning on key format mismatch**. Adds support for automatic repartitioning of \n+   streams and tables for joins where key formats do not match.\n+1. **Schema Registry support**: Adds support for reading and writing schemas to and from the schema\n+   registry.\n+1. **JSON_SR support** Adds support for the `AVRO` key format, inc. schema registry integration.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "5d07d4501ae52a6357f0654e03da1bb4a0ada9c3"}, "originalPosition": 251}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMjk0NDAzNDUxOnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "design-proposals/klip-33-key-format.md", "isResolved": true, "comments": {"totalCount": 7, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wOC0xNlQwNDoxNDoyM1rOHBPYyg==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wOC0yMVQxMDoxNTowNlrOHEnung==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ3MTA2MjczMA==", "bodyText": "Why do we have two values?

This could impact the stream-table join result (as long as we are not able to handle out-of-order data more gracefully). Repartitioning the stream-side of a stream-table join might have the same ordering issues though, so I don't think it would buy us much from this POV. -- However, as stream-side repartitioning happens ofter for non-key steam-table joins anyway, we should try to piggyback here to avoid two repartitioning steps.\nFor table-table joins, the impact should be limited to the order of the output record, however, the result records should be exactly the same (as the per-key order is preserved, what is strong enough to not alter the result).\nFor stream-steam (inner) joins, we handle out-of-order data perfectly fine and thus there is no concern.\nThe \"higher throughput\" argument from Andy is a good one though, but it seems only to apply to stream-table joins (it seems a reasonable assumption that the stream has higher throughput than the table; but how often the join happens on the original stream-key is questionable anyway...). For stream-stream, and table-table joins (that are symmetric) is hard (impossible?) to know which side should be repartitioned from a perf point of view... Maybe taking the number of partitions into account (if ksqlDB could fetch the corresponding metadata upfront before compiling down to a Kafka Streams program) could be data point though -- we might want to pick the topic with fewer partitions to do the repartitioning and scale it out to the anticipated higher-throughput input.\nBut those optimizations might be beyond the scope of this KIP...\nThus, overall I am ok with picking the right input for all cases (as it fits the stream-table case, and does not impact the stream-stream or table-table case), but would highly recommend to piggyback the format change for stream-table joins to the stream-side repartitioning if possible.", "url": "https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/pull/6017#discussion_r474844333", "createdAt": "2020-08-21T17:55:05Z", "author": {"login": "mjsax"}, "path": "design-proposals/klip-33-key-format.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,299 @@\n+# KLIP 33 - Key format\n+\n+**Author**: @big-andy-coates | \n+**Release Target**: 0.13 | \n+**Status**: In Discussion | \n+**Discussion**: _link to the design discussion PR_\n+\n+**tl;dr:** ksqlDB currently only supports keys compatible with the `KAFKA` format.

If the Schema Registry is not\n+configured to allow schema mutability to be set, then the statement will still succeed, only \n+a warning will be logged, with link to Schema Registry config that needs changing.\n+\n+If a `CREATE TABLE` or `CREATE STREAM` statement does not include a `KEY_FORMAT` property, the \n+key format is picked up from the `ksql.persistence.default.format.key` system configuration. If this\n+is not set, then an error is returned.  Note: The server config will have this set to `KAFKA` to \n+maintain backwards compatibility with current system by default. \n+\n+### Implementation\n+\n+The system already serializes the key format of source, intermediate and sink topics as part of the\n+query plan, meaning it should be fairly easily to plug in new formats. \n+\n+Validation will be added to ensure only supported key formats are set, and that key column data types\n+are supported by key formats.\n+\n+Most existing functionality should _just work_, as the key format only comes into play during \n+(de)serialization, (obviously). The only area where additional work is expected are joins and key-less \n+streams.\n+\n+#### Joins\n+\n+Joins require the binary key of both sides of the join to match and both sides to be delivered to \n+the same ksqlDB node.  The former normally ensuring the latter, unless a custom partitioning \n+strategy has been used.\n+\n+The introduction of additional key formats means that while the deserialized key from both sides of \n+a join may match, the serialized binary data may differ if the key serialization format is different.\n+To accommodate this, ksqlDB will automagically repartition one side of a join to match the key\n+format of the other.\n+\n+Many joins require an implicit repartition of one or both sides to facilitate the join. In such \n+situations the change of key format can be performed in the same repartitioned step, avoiding any\n+additional re-partitions. This means that joining sources with different key formats will only \n+require an implicit repartition to converge the key formats _if_ neither side is already being \n+repartitioned.\n+\n+Where one side must be repartitioned to correct the key format, choosing which side to reparation ", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "1e036bffcdf0d37a826b1e4e037e7319d6cc39c1"}, "originalPosition": 194}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMzA0MjYyNjcwOnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "design-proposals/klip-33-key-format.md", "isResolved": true, "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wOS0xMFQxNToxNToyNFrOHP5CjQ==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wOS0xMFQxNToxNToyNFrOHP5CjQ==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4NjQyNTIyOQ==", "bodyText": "This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

Supporting other key formats \n+opens this up to also transforming the key into a different format. \n+\n+In some cases users are able to work around this limitation. This may involve changing upstream code,\n+or introducing pre-processing, or, in the case of Connect, using SMTs to convert the key format. All\n+such solutions tend to increase the complexity of the system, and generally hurt performance.\n+\n+To open ksqlDB up to new problems spaces and to drive adoption, ksqlDB should support other key formats. \n+\n+## What is in scope\n+\n+ * Addition of a new optional `KEY_FORMAT` property in the `WITH` clause, to set the key format.\n+ * Addition of a new optional `FORMAT` property in the `WITH` clause, to set both the key & value formats.\n+ * Addition of new server configuration to provide defaults for key format.\n+ * Support for additional key column data types, where the key format supports it:\n+    * `DECIMAL`\n+    * `BOOLEAN`\n+ * Support of the following key formats:\n+    * `KAFKA`: the current key format.\n+    * `DELIMITED`: single key columns as a single string value.\n+    * `JSON` / `JSON_SR`: single key column as an anonymous value, i.e. not within a JSON object.\n+    * `AVRO`: single key column as an anonymous value, i.e. not within an Avro record.\n+    * `NONE`: special format indicating no data, or ignored data, e.g. a key-less stream.\n+  * Storing and retrieving key schemas from the Schema Registry for formats that support the integration.\n+  * Full support of these key formats for all supported SQL syntax.\n+  * Automatic repartitioning of streams and tables for joins where key formats do not match.\n+  * Support for reading & writing key schemas to & from the schema registry.\n+  * Enhancements to QTT and the ksqlDB testing tool to allow for keys with formats beyond KAFKA. \n+\n+## What is not in scope\n+\n+ * Support for multiple key columns: this will come later.\n+ * Support for single key columns _wrapped_ in an envelope of some kind: this will come later.\n+ * Support for complex key column data types, i.e. array, struct and map: this will come later. \n+ * Support for `PROTOBUF` keys, as this requires support for wrapped keys: this will come later.\n+ * Enhancing DataGen to support non-KAFKA keys.\n+ * Key schema evolution. (See [key schema evolution](#key-schema-evolution)) in the compatibility \n+   section.\n+ * Support for right-outer joins. This may be covered in a future KLIP.\n+\n+## Value/Return\n+\n+We know from customers and community members that there are a lot of people that have data with \n+non-`KAFKA` formatted keys. This is the first step to unlocking that data and use-cases.\n+\n+With support for `AVRO` and `JSON` key formats there are a lot of existing use-cases that suddenly\n+no longer require pre-processing, or tricky Connect SMTs configured, and there are new use-cases,\n+which ksqlDB was previously unsuitable for, as documented in the motivation section, which can \n+now be handled.\n+\n+## Public APIS\n+\n+### CREATE properties\n+\n+The following new properties will be accepted in the `WITH` clause of `CREATE` statements for streams\n+and tables.\n+\n+* `KEY_FORMAT`: sets the key format, works long the same lines as the existing `VALUE_FORMAT`.\n+* `FORMAT`: sets both the key and value format with a single property.\n+\n+`KEY_FORMAT` will not be a required property _if_ `ksql.persistence.default.format.key` is set.\n+\n+Providing `FORMAT` will set both the key and value formats. Providing `FORMAT` along with either \n+`KEY_FORMAT` or `VALUE_FORMAT` will result in an error.\n+\n+### Server configs\n+\n+The following new configuration options will be added. These configurations can be set globally, \n+within the application property file, or locally, via the `SET` command.\n+\n+* `ksql.persistence.default.format.key`: the default key format.\n+\n+## Design\n+\n+The new `KEY_FORMAT` or `FORMAT` property will be supported where ever the current `VALUE_FORMAT` is\n+supported. Namely:\n+\n+ * In `CRREATE STREAM` and `CREATE TABLE` statements.\n+ * In `CREATE STREAM AS SELECT` and `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` statements.\n+ \n+The key format will follow the same inheritance rules as the current value format. Namely: any \n+derived stream will inherit the format of its leftmost source, unless the format is explicitly set\n+in the with clause.\n+\n+For example:\n+\n+```sql\n+-- Creates a table over a changelog topic with AVRO key and JSON value:\n+CREATE TABLE USERS (\n+    ID BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,\n+    NAME STRING\n+  ) WITH (\n+    KAFKA_TOPIC='USERS',\n+    KEY_FORMAT='AVRO',\n+    VALUE_FORMAT='JSON'\n+  );\n+\n+-- Creates a stream over a topic with JSON key and value:\n+CREATE STREAM BIDS (\n+    ITEM_ID BIGINT KEY,\n+    USER_ID BIGINT,\n+    AMMOUNT INT\n+  ) WITH (\n+    KAFKA_TOPIC='USERS',\n+    FORMAT='JSON'\n+  );\n+\n+-- Change the key format of a stream:\n+CREATE STREAM AVRO_BIDS \n+  WITH WITH (\n+    KEY_FORMAT='AVRO'\n+  ) AS\n+    SELECT * FROM BIDS;\n+\n+-- Creates an enriched stream. The key format is inherited from the leftmost source, i.e. JSON:\n+CREATE STREAM ENRICHED_BIDS AS \n+  SELECT *\n+  FROM BIDS \n+   JOIN USERS ON BIDS.USER_ID = USERS.ID;\n+```\n+\n+For formats that support integration with the schema registry, the key schema will be read and \n+registered with the Schema Registry as needed, following the same pattern as the value schema in \n+the current product. \n+\n+In addition, where possible, key schemas will be marked as `READONLY` to avoid unintentional \n+changes to the key schema id, which would break compatibility. If the Schema Registry is not\n+configured to allow schema mutability to be set, then the statement will still succeed, only \n+a warning will be logged, with link to Schema Registry config that needs changing.\n+\n+If a `CREATE TABLE` or `CREATE STREAM` statement does not include a `KEY_FORMAT` property, the \n+key format is picked up from the `ksql.persistence.default.format.key` system configuration. If this\n+is not set, then an error is returned.  Note: The server config will have this set to `KAFKA` to \n+maintain backwards compatibility with current system by default. \n+\n+### Implementation\n+\n+The system already serializes the key format of source, intermediate and sink topics as part of the\n+query plan, meaning it should be fairly easily to plug in new formats. \n+\n+Validation will be added to ensure only supported key formats are set, and that key column data types\n+are supported by key formats.\n+\n+Most existing functionality should _just work_, as the key format only comes into play during \n+(de)serialization, (obviously). The only area where additional work is expected are joins and key-less \n+streams.\n+\n+#### Joins\n+\n+Joins require the binary key of both sides of the join to match and both sides to be delivered to \n+the same ksqlDB node.  The former normally ensuring the latter, unless a custom partitioning \n+strategy has been used.\n+\n+The introduction of additional key formats means that while the deserialized key from both sides of \n+a join may match, the serialized binary data may differ if the key serialization format is different.\n+To accommodate this, ksqlDB will automagically repartition one side of a join to match the key\n+format of the other.\n+\n+Many joins require an implicit repartition of one or both sides to facilitate the join. In such \n+situations the change of key format can be performed in the same repartitioned step, avoiding any\n+additional re-partitions. This means that joining sources with different key formats will only \n+require an implicit repartition to converge the key formats _if_ neither side is already being \n+repartitioned.\n+\n+Where one side must be repartitioned to correct the key format, choosing which side to reparation \n+can not be driven by the size of the data, as in a traditional database system, as the size of \n+the data is unknown, likely infinite. Ideally, for a streaming system it is the rate of change of \n+the data, i.e. the throughput, that would drive the choice. Unfortunately, this too can not be \n+known upfront.  For this reason, we propose repartitioning based on the order of sources within \n+the query, with the source on the _right_ being repartitioned.\n+\n+A benefit of making the choice order-based is that, once the rule is learned, users can predicate \n+and control which side is re-partitioned in some situations, i.e. stream-stream and table-table joins.\n+\n+Note: allowing users to freely switch left and right sources to control which side is repartitioned\n+will work for all but left-outer joins. To support switching left-outer joins ksqlDB would need to\n+support a right-outer join. The addition of this is deemed out of scope.\n+\n+Repartitioning the right side was chosen over the left, as it will mean stream-table joins will \n+repartition the table, which we propose will _generally_ see a lower throughput of updates to the \n+stream side. \n+\n+Such repartitioning is possible and safe... ish, even for tables, because the logical key of the \n+data will not have changed, only the serialization format. This ensures the ordering of updates to \n+a specific key are maintained across the repartition. Of course, the repartitioning would introduce \n+cross-key out-of-order data, as the records are shuffled across partitions.

This limits the\n+           data ksqlDB can work with. Extending the set of key formats ksqlDB supports immediately\n+           opens up the use of ksqlDB with previously incompatible datasets.\n+           \n+## Motivation and background\n+\n+Data stored in Kafka has a key and a value. These can be serialized using different formats, but\n+generally use a common format. ksqlDB supports multiple _value_ [data formats][1], but requires the \n+key data format to be the `KAFKA`.  \n+\n+This limitation is particularly problematic for tables. ksqlDB is unable to access changelog topics\n+in Kafka that have non-`KAFKA` formatted keys. As the key of the Kafka record is the `PRIMARY KEY` \n+of the table, it is essential that the key can be read if the changelog is to be materialised into a \n+table. When changelog topics have non-`KAFKA` key formats, the limitation precludes ksqlDB as a solution.\n+\n+The limitation is less damaging for streams. However, it is still the case that the user looses the\n+ability to access the data in the Kafka record's key. If this data is not duplicated in the record's\n+value, which generally seems to be the case, then the data is not accessible at all. If the data is\n+required, then the limitation precludes ksqlDB as a solution.\n+\n+As well as unsupported _input_ key formats, ksqlDB is equally precluded should a solution require the \n+_output_ to have a non-`KAFKA` key format. ksqlDB is often used as the glue between disparate systems, \n+even though it is limited to changing the _values_ format and structure.

Thus time-tracking \n+(\"stream-time\"), grace-period and retention-time might be affected. However, this  phenomenon \n+already exists, and is deemed acceptable, for other implicit re-partitions.\n+\n+#### Single key wrapping   \n+\n+To ensure query plans written after this work are forward compatible with future enhancements to \n+support single key columns wrapped in JSON object, Avro records, etc, and ultimately multiple key \n+columns, a new `UNWRAP_SINGLE_KEY` value will be added to `SerdeOption` and explicitly set on all\n+source, sink and internal topics. See [Future multi-column key work](#future-multi-column-key-work) \n+below for more info / background.\n+\n+#### Key-less streams\n+\n+A new `NONE` format will be introduced to allow users to provide a `KEY_FORMAT` that informs ksqlDB\n+to ignore the key. This format will be rejected as a `VALUE_FORMAT` for now, as ksqlDB does not yet\n+support value-less streams and tables. See [Schema Inference](#schema-inference) below for more \n+info / background.\n+\n+This format is predominately being added to allow users to declare key-less streams when the new \n+`ksql.persistence.default.format.key` system configuration is set to a format that supports schema\n+inference, i.e. loading the schema from the schema registry. If a user were not to explicitly set\n+the key format to `NONE` and attempt to create a stream, ksqlDB would attempt to read the key schema\n+from the schema registry, and report an error if the schema did not exist. The `NONE` format will \n+allow users to override the default key format and explicitly inform ksqlDB to ignore the key:\n+\n+```sql\n+SET 'ksql.persistence.default.format.key'='AVRO';\n+\n+-- Only the value columns of CLICKS will be loaded from the schema registry.\n+CREATE STREAM CLICKS \n+ WITH (\n+   key_format='NONE',  -- Informs kdqlDB to ignore the key\n+   value_format='AVRO',\n+   ...\n+);\n+```\n+\n+Declaring a table with key format `NONE` will result in an error.\n+\n+Defining key columns IN `CREATE TABLE` or `CREATE STREAM` statements where the key format is `NONE` \n+will result in an error:\n+\n+```sql\n+CREATE TABLE USER (\n+   ID INT PRIMARY KEY, \n+   NAME STRING\n+ ) WITH (\n+   key_format='NONE'  -- Error! Can't define key columns with this format\n+   ...\n+)  \n+``` \n+\n+`CREATE AS` statements that set the key, i.e. those containing `GROUP BY`, `PARTITION BY` and \n+`JOIN`, where the source has a `NONE` key format, and which do not explicitly define a key format, \n+will pick up their key format from the new `ksql.persistence.default.format.key` system \n+configuration. If this setting is not set, the statement will generate an error.\n+\n+```sql\n+CREATE STREAM KEY_LESS (\n+   NAME STRING\n+ ) WITH (\n+   key_format='NONE',\n+   ...\n+);\n+\n+-- Table T will get key format from the 'ksql.persistence.default.format.key' system config. \n+-- If the config is not set, an error will be generated. \n+CREATE TABLE T AS \n+  SELECT \n+    NAME, \n+    COUNT()\n+  FROM KEY_LESS\n+  GROUP BY NAME;\n+```\n+\n+`CREATE AS` statements that create key-less streams will now implicitly set the key format to \n+`NONE`.\n+\n+## Test plan\n+\n+Aside from the usual unit tests etc, the QTT suit of tests will be extended to cover the different\n+key formats. Tests will be added to cover the new syntax and configuration combinations and \n+permutations. Existing tests covering aggregations, re-partitions and joins will be extended to \n+include variants with different key formats. \n+\n+## LOEs and Delivery Milestones\n+\n+The KLIP will be broken down into the following deliverables:\n+\n+1. **Basic JSON support (5 weeks)**: Support for the `JSON` key format, without:\n+    * schema registry integration\n+    * Automatic repartitioning of streams and tables for joins where key formats do not match: such\n+      joins will result in an error initially.\n+  \n+    Included in this milestone:\n+    \n+    * Addition of a new optional `KEY_FORMAT` property in the `WITH` clause, to set the key format.\n+    * Addition of a new optional `FORMAT` property in the `WITH` clause, to set both the key & value formats.\n+    * Addition of new server configuration to provide defaults for key format.\n+    * Support for additional key column data types, as JSON supports them:\n+        * `DECIMAL`\n+        * `BOOLEAN`\n+    * Full support of the key format for all supported SQL syntax.  \n+    * Enhancements to QTT and the ksqlDB testing tool\n+    * Rest and HTTP2 server endpoints and Java client to work with new key format.\n+1. **NONE format (1 week)**: Supported on keys only. Needed to support key-less streams once we have SR integration.\n+1. **Schema Registry support**: Adds support for reading and writing schemas to and from the schema\n+   registry.\n+1. **JSON_SR support (1 week)** Adds support for the `JSON_SR` key format, inc. schema registry integration.\n+1. **Avro support (1 week)** Adds support for the `AVRO` key format, inc. schema registry integration.\n+1. **Delimited support (1 week)**: Adds support for the `DELIMITED` key format.\n+1. **Auto-repartitioning on key format mismatch (1.5 weeks)**. Adds support for automatic repartitioning of \n+   streams and tables for joins where key formats do not match.\n+1. **Blog post (1 week)**: write a blog post about the new features. Likely one post for everything _but_ \n+   auto-repartitioning, and a second to cover this.\n+   \n+## Documentation Updates\n+\n+New server config and new `CREATE` properties will be added to main docs site.\n+\n+There are no incompatible changes within the proposal, so no demos and examples _must_ change.\n+However, it probably pays to update some to highlight the new features. We propose updating the \n+Kafka micro site examples to leverage the new functionality, as these have automated testing.  \n+It may be worth changing the ksqlDB quickstart too.

This limits the\n+           data ksqlDB can work with. Extending the set of key formats ksqlDB supports immediately\n+           opens up the use of ksqlDB with previously incompatible datasets.\n+           \n+## Motivation and background\n+\n+Data stored in Kafka has a key and a value. These can be serialized using different formats, but\n+generally use a common format. ksqlDB supports multiple _value_ [data formats][1], but requires the \n+key data format to be the `KAFKA`.  \n+\n+This limitation is particularly problematic for tables. ksqlDB is unable to access changelog topics\n+in Kafka that have non-`KAFKA` formatted keys. As the key of the Kafka record is the `PRIMARY KEY` \n+of the table, it is essential that the key can be read if the changelog is to be materialised into a \n+table. When changelog topics have non-`KAFKA` key formats, the limitation precludes ksqlDB as a solution.\n+\n+The limitation is less damaging for streams. However, it is still the case that the user looses the\n+ability to access the data in the Kafka record's key. If this data is not duplicated in the record's\n+value, which generally seems to be the case, then the data is not accessible at all. If the data is\n+required, then the limitation precludes ksqlDB as a solution.\n+\n+As well as unsupported _input_ key formats, ksqlDB is equally precluded should a solution require the \n+_output_ to have a non-`KAFKA` key format. ksqlDB is often used as the glue between disparate systems, \n+even though it is limited to changing the _values_ format and structure. Supporting other key formats \n+opens this up to also transforming the key into a different format. \n+\n+In some cases users are able to work around this limitation. This may involve changing upstream code,\n+or introducing pre-processing, or, in the case of Connect, using SMTs to convert the key format. All\n+such solutions tend to increase the complexity of the system, and generally hurt performance.\n+\n+To open ksqlDB up to new problems spaces and to drive adoption, ksqlDB should support other key formats. \n+\n+## What is in scope\n+\n+ * Addition of a new optional `KEY_FORMAT` property in the `WITH` clause, to set the key format.\n+ * Addition of a new optional `FORMAT` property in the `WITH` clause, to set both the key & value formats.\n+ * Addition of new server configuration to provide defaults for key format.\n+ * Support for additional key column data types, where the key format supports it:\n+    * `DECIMAL`\n+    * `BOOLEAN`\n+ * Support of the following key formats:\n+    * `KAFKA`: the current key format.\n+    * `DELIMITED`: single key columns as a single string value.\n+    * `JSON` / `JSON_SR`: single key column as an anonymous value, i.e. not within a JSON object.\n+    * `AVRO`: single key column as an anonymous value, i.e. not within an Avro record.\n+    * `NONE`: special format indicating no data, or ignored data, e.g. a key-less stream.\n+  * Storing and retrieving key schemas from the Schema Registry for formats that support the integration.\n+  * Full support of these key formats for all supported SQL syntax.\n+  * Automatic repartitioning of streams and tables for joins where key formats do not match.\n+  * Support for reading & writing key schemas to & from the schema registry.\n+  * Enhancements to QTT and the ksqlDB testing tool to allow for keys with formats beyond KAFKA. \n+\n+## What is not in scope\n+\n+ * Support for multiple key columns: this will come later.\n+ * Support for single key columns _wrapped_ in an envelope of some kind: this will come later.\n+ * Support for complex key column data types, i.e. array, struct and map: this will come later. \n+ * Support for `PROTOBUF` keys, as this requires support for wrapped keys: this will come later.\n+ * Enhancing DataGen to support non-KAFKA keys.\n+ * Key schema evolution. (See [key schema evolution](#key-schema-evolution)) in the compatibility \n+   section.\n+ * Support for right-outer joins. This may be covered in a future KLIP.\n+\n+## Value/Return\n+\n+We know from customers and community members that there are a lot of people that have data with \n+non-`KAFKA` formatted keys. This is the first step to unlocking that data and use-cases.\n+\n+With support for `AVRO` and `JSON` key formats there are a lot of existing use-cases that suddenly\n+no longer require pre-processing, or tricky Connect SMTs configured, and there are new use-cases,\n+which ksqlDB was previously unsuitable for, as documented in the motivation section, which can \n+now be handled.\n+\n+## Public APIS\n+\n+### CREATE properties\n+\n+The following new properties will be accepted in the `WITH` clause of `CREATE` statements for streams\n+and tables.\n+\n+* `KEY_FORMAT`: sets the key format, works long the same lines as the existing `VALUE_FORMAT`.\n+* `FORMAT`: sets both the key and value format with a single property.\n+\n+`KEY_FORMAT` will not be a required property _if_ `ksql.persistence.default.format.key` is set.\n+\n+Providing `FORMAT` will set both the key and value formats. Providing `FORMAT` along with either \n+`KEY_FORMAT` or `VALUE_FORMAT` will result in an error.\n+\n+### Server configs\n+\n+The following new configuration options will be added. These configurations can be set globally, \n+within the application property file, or locally, via the `SET` command.\n+\n+* `ksql.persistence.default.format.key`: the default key format.\n+\n+## Design\n+\n+The new `KEY_FORMAT` or `FORMAT` property will be supported where ever the current `VALUE_FORMAT` is\n+supported. Namely:\n+\n+ * In `CRREATE STREAM` and `CREATE TABLE` statements.\n+ * In `CREATE STREAM AS SELECT` and `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` statements.\n+ \n+The key format will follow the same inheritance rules as the current value format. Namely: any \n+derived stream will inherit the format of its leftmost source, unless the format is explicitly set\n+in the with clause.\n+\n+For example:\n+\n+```sql\n+-- Creates a table over a changelog topic with AVRO key and JSON value:\n+CREATE TABLE USERS (\n+    ID BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,\n+    NAME STRING\n+  ) WITH (\n+    KAFKA_TOPIC='USERS',\n+    KEY_FORMAT='AVRO',\n+    VALUE_FORMAT='JSON'\n+  );\n+\n+-- Creates a stream over a topic with JSON key and value:\n+CREATE STREAM BIDS (\n+    ITEM_ID BIGINT KEY,\n+    USER_ID BIGINT,\n+    AMMOUNT INT\n+  ) WITH (\n+    KAFKA_TOPIC='USERS',\n+    FORMAT='JSON'\n+  );\n+\n+-- Change the key format of a stream:\n+CREATE STREAM AVRO_BIDS \n+  WITH WITH (\n+    KEY_FORMAT='AVRO'\n+  ) AS\n+    SELECT * FROM BIDS;\n+\n+-- Creates an enriched stream. The key format is inherited from the leftmost source, i.e. JSON:\n+CREATE STREAM ENRICHED_BIDS AS \n+  SELECT *\n+  FROM BIDS \n+   JOIN USERS ON BIDS.USER_ID = USERS.ID;\n+```\n+\n+For formats that support integration with the schema registry, the key schema will be read and \n+registered with the Schema Registry as needed, following the same pattern as the value schema in \n+the current product. \n+\n+In addition, where possible, key schemas will be marked as `READONLY` to avoid unintentional \n+changes to the key schema id, which would break compatibility. If the Schema Registry is not\n+configured to allow schema mutability to be set, then the statement will still succeed, only \n+a warning will be logged, with link to Schema Registry config that needs changing.\n+\n+If a `CREATE TABLE` or `CREATE STREAM` statement does not include a `KEY_FORMAT` property, the \n+key format is picked up from the `ksql.persistence.default.format.key` system configuration. If this\n+is not set, then an error is returned.  Note: The server config will have this set to `KAFKA` to \n+maintain backwards compatibility with current system by default. \n+\n+### Implementation\n+\n+The system already serializes the key format of source, intermediate and sink topics as part of the\n+query plan, meaning it should be fairly easily to plug in new formats. \n+\n+Validation will be added to ensure only supported key formats are set, and that key column data types\n+are supported by key formats.\n+\n+Most existing functionality should _just work_, as the key format only comes into play during \n+(de)serialization, (obviously). The only area where additional work is expected are joins and key-less \n+streams.\n+\n+#### Joins\n+\n+Joins require the binary key of both sides of the join to match and both sides to be delivered to \n+the same ksqlDB node.  The former normally ensuring the latter, unless a custom partitioning \n+strategy has been used.\n+\n+The introduction of additional key formats means that while the deserialized key from both sides of \n+a join may match, the serialized binary data may differ if the key serialization format is different.\n+To accommodate this, ksqlDB will automagically repartition one side of a join to match the key\n+format of the other.\n+\n+Many joins require an implicit repartition of one or both sides to facilitate the join. In such \n+situations the change of key format can be performed in the same repartitioned step, avoiding any\n+additional re-partitions. This means that joining sources with different key formats will only \n+require an implicit repartition to converge the key formats _if_ neither side is already being \n+repartitioned.\n+\n+Where one side must be repartitioned to correct the key format, choosing which side to reparation \n+can not be driven by the size of the data, as in a traditional database system, as the size of \n+the data is unknown, likely infinite. Ideally, for a streaming system it is the rate of change of \n+the data, i.e. the throughput, that would drive the choice. Unfortunately, this too can not be \n+known upfront.  For this reason, we propose repartitioning based on the order of sources within \n+the query, with the source on the _right_ being repartitioned.\n+\n+A benefit of making the choice order-based is that, once the rule is learned, users can predicate ", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "1e036bffcdf0d37a826b1e4e037e7319d6cc39c1"}, "originalPosition": 201}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMzA0MzM5OTcxOnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "design-proposals/klip-33-key-format.md", "isResolved": false, "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wOS0xMFQxODoyNjoxMFrOHQAmGw==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wOS0xMFQxODoyNjoxMFrOHQAmGw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4NjU0OTAxOQ==", "bodyText": "Add note clarifying that users can always repartition topics themselves before the join, in order to have full control over which sources are repartitioned (and that choosing the same sources ksqlDB would repartition and performing the repartitions upfront is equivalent from a resource-usage standpoint)?

This ensures the ordering of updates to \n+a specific key are maintained across the repartition. Of course, the repartitioning would introduce \n+cross-key out-of-order data, as the records are shuffled across partitions. That is to say that \n+even if the source partitions where correctly ordered by time, the re-partitioned partitions would \n+see out-of-order records, though per-key ordering would be maintained. Thus time-tracking \n+(\"stream-time\"), grace-period and retention-time might be affected.

If this data is not duplicated in the record's\n+value, which generally seems to be the case, then the data is not accessible at all. If the data is\n+required, then the limitation precludes ksqlDB as a solution.\n+\n+As well as unsupported _input_ key formats, ksqlDB is equally precluded should a solution require the \n+_output_ to have a non-`KAFKA` key format. ksqlDB is often used as the glue between disparate systems, \n+even though it is limited to changing the _values_ format and structure. Supporting other key formats \n+opens this up to also transforming the key into a different format. \n+\n+In some cases users are able to work around this limitation. This may involve changing upstream code,\n+or introducing pre-processing, or, in the case of Connect, using SMTs to convert the key format. All\n+such solutions tend to increase the complexity of the system, and generally hurt performance.\n+\n+To open ksqlDB up to new problems spaces and to drive adoption, ksqlDB should support other key formats. \n+\n+## What is in scope\n+\n+ * Addition of a new optional `KEY_FORMAT` property in the `WITH` clause, to set the key format.\n+ * Addition of a new optional `FORMAT` property in the `WITH` clause, to set both the key & value formats.\n+ * Addition of new server configuration to provide defaults for key format.\n+ * Support for additional key column data types, where the key format supports it:\n+    * `DECIMAL`\n+    * `BOOLEAN`\n+ * Support of the following key formats:\n+    * `KAFKA`: the current key format.\n+    * `DELIMITED`: single key columns as a single string value.\n+    * `JSON` / `JSON_SR`: single key column as an anonymous value, i.e. not within a JSON object.\n+    * `AVRO`: single key column as an anonymous value, i.e. not within an Avro record.\n+    * `NONE`: special format indicating no data, or ignored data, e.g. a key-less stream.\n+  * Storing and retrieving key schemas from the Schema Registry for formats that support the integration.\n+  * Full support of these key formats for all supported SQL syntax.\n+  * Automatic repartitioning of streams and tables for joins where key formats do not match.\n+  * Support for reading & writing key schemas to & from the schema registry.\n+  * Enhancements to QTT and the ksqlDB testing tool to allow for keys with formats beyond KAFKA. \n+\n+## What is not in scope\n+\n+ * Support for multiple key columns: this will come later.\n+ * Support for single key columns _wrapped_ in an envelope of some kind: this will come later.\n+ * Support for complex key column data types, i.e. array, struct and map: this will come later. \n+ * Support for `PROTOBUF` keys, as this requires support for wrapped keys: this will come later.\n+ * Enhancing DataGen to support non-KAFKA keys.\n+ * Key schema evolution. (See [key schema evolution](#key-schema-evolution)) in the compatibility \n+   section.\n+ * Support for right-outer joins. This may be covered in a future KLIP.\n+\n+## Value/Return\n+\n+We know from customers and community members that there are a lot of people that have data with \n+non-`KAFKA` formatted keys. This is the first step to unlocking that data and use-cases.\n+\n+With support for `AVRO` and `JSON` key formats there are a lot of existing use-cases that suddenly\n+no longer require pre-processing, or tricky Connect SMTs configured, and there are new use-cases,\n+which ksqlDB was previously unsuitable for, as documented in the motivation section, which can \n+now be handled.\n+\n+## Public APIS\n+\n+### CREATE properties\n+\n+The following new properties will be accepted in the `WITH` clause of `CREATE` statements for streams\n+and tables.\n+\n+* `KEY_FORMAT`: sets the key format, works long the same lines as the existing `VALUE_FORMAT`.\n+* `FORMAT`: sets both the key and value format with a single property.\n+\n+`KEY_FORMAT` will not be a required property _if_ `ksql.persistence.default.format.key` is set.\n+\n+Providing `FORMAT` will set both the key and value formats. Providing `FORMAT` along with either \n+`KEY_FORMAT` or `VALUE_FORMAT` will result in an error.\n+\n+### Server configs\n+\n+The following new configuration options will be added. These configurations can be set globally, \n+within the application property file, or locally, via the `SET` command.\n+\n+* `ksql.persistence.default.format.key`: the default key format.\n+\n+## Design\n+\n+The new `KEY_FORMAT` or `FORMAT` property will be supported where ever the current `VALUE_FORMAT` is\n+supported. Namely:\n+\n+ * In `CRREATE STREAM` and `CREATE TABLE` statements.\n+ * In `CREATE STREAM AS SELECT` and `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` statements.\n+ \n+The key format will follow the same inheritance rules as the current value format. Namely: any \n+derived stream will inherit the format of its leftmost source, unless the format is explicitly set\n+in the with clause.\n+\n+For example:\n+\n+```sql\n+-- Creates a table over a changelog topic with AVRO key and JSON value:\n+CREATE TABLE USERS (\n+    ID BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,\n+    NAME STRING\n+  ) WITH (\n+    KAFKA_TOPIC='USERS',\n+    KEY_FORMAT='AVRO',\n+    VALUE_FORMAT='JSON'\n+  );\n+\n+-- Creates a stream over a topic with JSON key and value:\n+CREATE STREAM BIDS (\n+    ITEM_ID BIGINT KEY,\n+    USER_ID BIGINT,\n+    AMMOUNT INT\n+  ) WITH (\n+    KAFKA_TOPIC='USERS',\n+    FORMAT='JSON'\n+  );\n+\n+-- Change the key format of a stream:\n+CREATE STREAM AVRO_BIDS \n+  WITH WITH (\n+    KEY_FORMAT='AVRO'\n+  ) AS\n+    SELECT * FROM BIDS;\n+\n+-- Creates an enriched stream. The key format is inherited from the leftmost source, i.e. JSON:\n+CREATE STREAM ENRICHED_BIDS AS \n+  SELECT *\n+  FROM BIDS \n+   JOIN USERS ON BIDS.USER_ID = USERS.ID;\n+```\n+\n+For formats that support integration with the schema registry, the key schema will be read and \n+registered with the Schema Registry as needed, following the same pattern as the value schema in \n+the current product. \n+\n+In addition, where possible, key schemas will be marked as `READONLY` to avoid unintentional \n+changes to the key schema id, which would break compatibility. If the Schema Registry is not\n+configured to allow schema mutability to be set, then the statement will still succeed, only \n+a warning will be logged, with link to Schema Registry config that needs changing.\n+\n+If a `CREATE TABLE` or `CREATE STREAM` statement does not include a `KEY_FORMAT` property, the \n+key format is picked up from the `ksql.persistence.default.format.key` system configuration. If this\n+is not set, then an error is returned.  Note: The server config will have this set to `KAFKA` to \n+maintain backwards compatibility with current system by default. \n+\n+### Implementation\n+\n+The system already serializes the key format of source, intermediate and sink topics as part of the\n+query plan, meaning it should be fairly easily to plug in new formats. \n+\n+Validation will be added to ensure only supported key formats are set, and that key column data types\n+are supported by key formats.\n+\n+Most existing functionality should _just work_, as the key format only comes into play during \n+(de)serialization, (obviously). The only area where additional work is expected are joins and key-less \n+streams.\n+\n+#### Joins\n+\n+Joins require the binary key of both sides of the join to match and both sides to be delivered to \n+the same ksqlDB node.  The former normally ensuring the latter, unless a custom partitioning \n+strategy has been used.\n+\n+The introduction of additional key formats means that while the deserialized key from both sides of \n+a join may match, the serialized binary data may differ if the key serialization format is different.\n+To accommodate this, ksqlDB will automagically repartition one side of a join to match the key\n+format of the other.\n+\n+Many joins require an implicit repartition of one or both sides to facilitate the join. In such \n+situations the change of key format can be performed in the same repartitioned step, avoiding any\n+additional re-partitions. This means that joining sources with different key formats will only \n+require an implicit repartition to converge the key formats _if_ neither side is already being \n+repartitioned.\n+\n+Where one side must be repartitioned to correct the key format, choosing which side to reparation \n+can not be driven by the size of the data, as in a traditional database system, as the size of \n+the data is unknown, likely infinite. Ideally, for a streaming system it is the rate of change of \n+the data, i.e. the throughput, that would drive the choice. Unfortunately, this too can not be \n+known upfront.  For this reason, we propose repartitioning based on the order of sources within \n+the query, with the source on the _right_ being repartitioned.\n+\n+A benefit of making the choice order-based is that, once the rule is learned, users can predicate \n+and control which side is re-partitioned in some situations, i.e. stream-stream and table-table joins.\n+\n+Note: allowing users to freely switch left and right sources to control which side is repartitioned\n+will work for all but left-outer joins. To support switching left-outer joins ksqlDB would need to\n+support a right-outer join. The addition of this is deemed out of scope.\n+\n+Repartitioning the right side was chosen over the left, as it will mean stream-table joins will \n+repartition the table, which we propose will _generally_ see a lower throughput of updates to the \n+stream side. \n+\n+Such repartitioning is possible and safe... ish, even for tables, because the logical key of the \n+data will not have changed, only the serialization format. This ensures the ordering of updates to \n+a specific key are maintained across the repartition. Of course, the repartitioning would introduce \n+cross-key out-of-order data, as the records are shuffled across partitions. That is to say that \n+even if the source partitions where correctly ordered by time, the re-partitioned partitions would \n+see out-of-order records, though per-key ordering would be maintained. Thus time-tracking \n+(\"stream-time\"), grace-period and retention-time might be affected. However, this  phenomenon \n+already exists, and is deemed acceptable, for other implicit re-partitions.\n+\n+#### Single key wrapping   \n+\n+To ensure query plans written after this work are forward compatible with future enhancements to \n+support single key columns wrapped in JSON object, Avro records, etc, and ultimately multiple key \n+columns, a new `UNWRAP_SINGLE_KEY` value will be added to `SerdeOption` and explicitly set on all\n+source, sink and internal topics. See [Future multi-column key work](#future-multi-column-key-work) \n+below for more info / background.\n+\n+#### Key-less streams\n+\n+A new `NONE` format will be introduced to allow users to provide a `KEY_FORMAT` that informs ksqlDB\n+to ignore the key. This format will be rejected as a `VALUE_FORMAT` for now, as ksqlDB does not yet\n+support value-less streams and tables. See [Schema Inference](#schema-inference) below for more \n+info / background.\n+\n+This format is predominately being added to allow users to declare key-less streams when the new \n+`ksql.persistence.default.format.key` system configuration is set to a format that supports schema\n+inference, i.e. loading the schema from the schema registry. If a user were not to explicitly set\n+the key format to `NONE` and attempt to create a stream, ksqlDB would attempt to read the key schema\n+from the schema registry, and report an error if the schema did not exist. The `NONE` format will \n+allow users to override the default key format and explicitly inform ksqlDB to ignore the key:\n+\n+```sql\n+SET 'ksql.persistence.default.format.key'='AVRO';\n+\n+-- Only the value columns of CLICKS will be loaded from the schema registry.\n+CREATE STREAM CLICKS \n+ WITH (\n+   key_format='NONE',  -- Informs kdqlDB to ignore the key", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "1e036bffcdf0d37a826b1e4e037e7319d6cc39c1"}, "originalPosition": 249}]}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 2880, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-12T19:05:54Z"}}}
