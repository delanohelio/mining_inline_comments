The idea behind this interface was to provide an api to a message queue where a caller could enqueue/dequeue, and also register to be notified when a given message is consumed/processed, or when a given offset is consumed/processed. It's not important that the backing store is Kafka, and that shouldn't really leak into the interface (I know the txnl producer is in there, but that can be fixed). It's also not that important that the messages have key/value types CommandID/Command (I know, bad naming \ud83d\ude01 ). Therefore I think it would be better to organize this in the following way:\nLeave this interface mostly the same, except change references to Command and CommandID to byte[]\nChange QueuedCommand's members to be:\nclass QueuedCommand {\n    byte[] commandId;\n    byte[] command;\n    ....\n}\n\nThat said, it is useful to have an explicit type for Command to improve safety (so for example, a caller can't accidentally mix them up, or CommandStore can't accidentally use the Command as the key to the status map). So, an additional improvement we could make would be to leave the command parameters as type Command (I'd still use byte[] for the command id and just serialize/deserialize that from the caller). Then, in QueuedCommand, change getCommand to getAndDeserializeCommand(Deserializer<Command> deserializer) so that CommandRunner is the entity that actually does the deserialization.", "url": "https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/pull/6012#discussion_r471857186", "createdAt": "2020-08-18T01:11:37Z", "author": {"login": "rodesai"}, "path": "ksqldb-rest-app/src/main/java/io/confluent/ksql/rest/server/computation/CommandQueue.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -48,29 +52,32 @@ QueuedCommandStatus enqueueCommand(\n   );\n   \n   /**\n-   * Polls the Queue for any commands that have been enqueued since the last\n-   * invocation to this method.\n+   * Polls the Queue for any command records that have been enqueued since the last\n+   * invocation to this method.
