I've added some details to the KLIP explain the complexities and challenges of doing so.\nPersonally, I don't like the idea of using a hardcoded ROWKEY and introducing the ambiguity and inconsistencies I've hopefully explained above, naming:\n\nIt's hard for a user to know if ROWKEY in a projection refers to a synthesised column or a column from the source.\nIt's inconsistent with how ksqlDB has historically supported ambiguous column names in the projection. ksqlDB currently requires any ambiguous column name to be fully qualified, however the synthetic column can not be fully qualified as it does not come from a source table/stream.\nImplementing this will be a PITA to be honest, due to the current implementation we've inherited.\n\nThe ways forward I see are (in no particular order):\n\nGo with the hardcoded name in the upcoming release, with the likely release delays that will result..\nStick with the system generated names in this PR, e.g. KSQL_COL_0.\nGo with the system generated names for the upcoming release and switch to hardcoded for the next.\nRequire the user to always provide an alias for any synthetic column, thereby avoiding the name clashing / ambiguity.  We've have to pick a new reserved column name, as ROWKEY is still the default key column name if one is not explicitly provided.  The main downside of such an approach is that a SELECT * would fail as it doesn't provide an alias.\nAdd a unique postfix to  ROWKEY to ensure its unique. Most of the time it will be ROWKEY, but if the source data contains a ROWKEY column then it will become ROWKEY_1, or some other number to ensure its unique. This is essentially the same pattern as what this PR has, just using a different name, i.e. ROWKEY rather than KSQL_COL.  This would be easy to change to.\n\nYour thoughts please gentlemen....", "url": "https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/pull/5457#discussion_r429182849", "createdAt": "2020-05-22T11:02:57Z", "author": {"login": "big-andy-coates"}, "path": "design-proposals/klip-24-key-column-semantics-in-queries.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -541,28 +564,51 @@ The following naming strategies were rejected:\n \n #### `ROWKEY`/`JOINKEY` or other hardcoded name\n \n-The synthesised column would take on a hardcoded name.
