If the value of the message key in\n-the topic is the same as one of the columns defined in the stream, you\n-can specify the key in the WITH clause of the CREATE STREAM statement.\n-If you use this column name later to perform a join or a repartition, ksqlDB\n-knows that no repartition is needed. In effect, the named column becomes an\n-alias for ROWKEY.\n+The previous SQL statement does not define a column to represent the data in the\n+Kafka message key in the underlying Kafka topic. The system therefore added a\n+`ROWKEY` column with type `STRING`.\n+\n+Where the Kafka message key is serialized in a key format ksqlDB supports, (currently only `KAFKA`),\n+you can specify the key in the column list of the CREATE STREAM statement.\n \n-For example, if the Kafka message key has the same value as the `pageid`\n-column, you can write the CREATE STREAM statement like this:\n+For example, the Kafka message key of the pageviews topic is a `BIGINT` containing the `viewtime`.\n+So, you can write the CREATE STREAM statement like this:", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "d4c7d684e8a3526232c015828bd1845c065048e8"}, "originalPosition": 29}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMjY0ODc2ODExOnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "docs/developer-guide/joins/partition-data.md", "isResolved": true, "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNS0xNFQxODo0NjozOVrOGVptsQ==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNS0xNFQxODo0NjozOVrOGVptsQ==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyNTM1NjcyMQ==", "bodyText": "This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.
