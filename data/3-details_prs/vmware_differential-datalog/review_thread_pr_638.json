A common solution is to pass it around as an implicit arg. We have to be careful with this, as implicit args should only be used for things that never change, and we do rewrite DatalogProgram several times. Perhaps, we could have two functions, one that expects DatalogProgram as explicit argument and one that takes it as an implicit parameter.", "url": "https://github.com/vmware/differential-datalog/pull/638#discussion_r414045439", "createdAt": "2020-04-23T18:56:43Z", "author": {"login": "ryzhyk"}, "path": "src/Language/DifferentialDatalog/Error.hs", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,58 @@\n+{-\n+Copyright (c) 2020 VMware, Inc.\n+SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\n+\n+Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\n+of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\n+in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\n+to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\n+copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\n+furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n+\n+The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\n+copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n+\n+THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\n+IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n+FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
