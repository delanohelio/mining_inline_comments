DDlog generates\n+  commented out function prototypes in Rust to help the user come up with\n+  correct signatures.\n+  See the [section on extern functions](#extern-functions) for details.\n+\n+- Rust code can access function and type declarations in other program\n+  modules and libraries through the `crate::` namespace, e.g., to import\n+  the standard DDlog library:\n+\n+  ```\n+  use crate::ddlog_std;\n+  ```\n+\n+- Extern functions and types often contain dependencies on third-party crates.\n+  Such dependencies must be added to the generated `types/Cargo.toml` file.\n+  To this end, create a file with the same name and location as the DDlog module\n+  and `.toml` extension, containing dependency clauses in `Cargo.toml` format.\n+  As an example, the `lib/regex.dl` library that implements DDlog bindings to the\n+  regular expressions crate `regex` has an accompanying `lib/regex.toml` file\n+  with the following contents:\n+\n+  ```\n+  [dependencies.regex]\n+  version = \"1.1\"\n+  ```\n+\n+  There is an important caveat: only one module in your program can import any\n+  given external crate. As a workaround, we recommend creating a separate DDlog\n+  library for each extern crate and only list this crate as a dependency for this\n+  library, e.g., `lib/regex.dl for the `regex` crate, `lib/url.dl` for the url", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "69847dac257f12b4662e1d657ec06287f3eb993d"}, "originalPosition": 169}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4ODEyMjc3OQ==", "bodyText": "is this documented? should users care?", "url": "https://github.com/vmware/differential-datalog/pull/763#discussion_r488122779", "createdAt": "2020-09-14T18:02:42Z", "author": {"login": "mbudiu-vmw"}, "path": "lib/ddlog_std.dl", "diffHunk": "@@ -6,10 +6,15 @@\n import debug\n import log\n \n+#[alias]", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "69847dac257f12b4662e1d657ec06287f3eb993d"}, "originalPosition": 4}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4ODEzMTk4Ng==", "bodyText": "how come these are needed now but not before?", "url": "https://github.com/vmware/differential-datalog/pull/763#discussion_r488131986", "createdAt": "2020-09-14T18:19:11Z", "author": {"login": "mbudiu-vmw"}, "path": "rust/template/types/flatbuf.rs", "diffHunk": "@@ -1,9 +1,11 @@\n //!
