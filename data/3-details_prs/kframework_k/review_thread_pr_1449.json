All Rights Reserved.\n+---\n+\n+Capture-Aware Substitution in K\n+===============================\n+\n+One of the traditional ways in which functional languages are given operational\n+semantics is via substitution. In particular, you can view a function as\n+declaring a particular bound variable, the parameter of the function, as well\n+as the body of the function, within which both bound and free variables can\n+occur, and implement the process of beta-reduction (one of the axioms of the\n+lambda calculus) by means of a substitution operator which is aware of the\n+difference between free variables and bound variables and prevents variable\n+capture.\n+\n+In K this is implemented using two mechanisms: The `KVar` sort, and the\n+`binder` attribute.\n+\n+The `KVar` Sort\n+---------------\n+\n+K introduces a new hooked sort, `KVar`, which the substitution operator\n+(defined below) understands in a particular way. The syntax of `KVar` is the\n+same as for sort `Id` in `DOMAINS`, but with a different sort name. Similarly,\n+some of the same operators are defined over `KVar` which are defined for `Id`,\n+such as conversion from `String` to `KVar` and support for the `!Var:KVar`\n+syntax.\n+\n+A `KVar` is simply an identifier with special meaning during substitution.\n+`KVar`s must begin with a letter or underscore,\n+and can be followed by zero or more letters, numbers, or underscores.\n+\n+```k\n+module KVAR-SYNTAX-PROGRAM-PARSING\n+  imports BUILTIN-ID-TOKENS\n+\n+  syntax KVar ::= r\"(?<![A-Za-z0-9\\\\_])[A-Za-z\\\\_][A-Za-z0-9\\\\_]*\"     [prec(1), token]\n+\n+              | #LowerId                                             [token]\n+              | #UpperId                                             [token]", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "7c5216d931fe054bd3ec3a052e2128f533529dc0"}, "originalPosition": 42}]}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 2981, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-12T20:28:25Z"}}}
