In this case, you can get all possible\n+parses that were valid by means of the `--gen-glr-parser` command line flag.\n+Usually, however, this indicates a problem in your grammar.\n+\n+Priority is specified in K grammars by means of one of two different\n+mechanisms. The first, and simplest, simply replaces the `|` operator in a \n+sequence of K productions with the `>` operator. This operator indicates that\n+everything prior to the `>` operator (including transitively) binds tighter\n+than what comes after. For example, a more complete grammar for simple\n+arithmetic might be:\n+\n+```k\n+syntax Exp ::= Exp \"*\" Exp\n+             | Exp \"/\" Exp\n+             > Exp \"+\" Exp\n+             | Exp \"-\" Exp\n+```\n+\n+This indicates that multiplication and division bind tigher than addition\n+and subtraction, but that there is no relationship in priority between\n+multiplication and division.\n+\n+As you may have noticed, this grammar is also ambiguous. `x*y/z` might refer to\n+`x*(y/z)` or to `(x*y)/z`. Indeed, if we removed division and subtraction\n+entirely, the grammar would still be ambiguous: `x*y*z` might parse as\n+`x*(y*z)`, or as `(x*y)*z`. To resolve this, we introduce another feature:\n+associativity. Roughly, asssociativity tells us how symbols are allowed to nest\n+within other symbols with the same priority. If a set of symbols is left\n+associative, then symbols in that set cannot appear as the rightmost child\n+of other symbols in that set. If a set of symbols is right associative, then\n+symbols in that set cannot appear as the leftmost child of other symbols in\n+that set. Finally, if a set of symbols is non-associative, then symbols\n+in that set cannot appear as the rightmost or leftmost child of other symbols\n+in that set. For example, in the above example, if addition and subtraction\n+are left associative, then `x+y+z` will parse as `(x+y)+`z and `x+y-z` will\n+parse as `(x+y)-z` (because the other parse will have been rejected).\n+\n+You might notice that this seems to apply only to binary infix operators. In\n+fact, the real behavior is slightly more complicated. Priority and\n+associativity (for technical reasons that go beyond the scope of this document)\n+really only apply when the rightmost or leftmost item in a production is a\n+nonterminal. If the rightmost nonterminal is followed by a terminal (or\n+respectively the leftmost preceded), priority and associativity do not apply.\n+Thus we can generalize these concepts to arbitrary context-free grammars.\n+\n+Associativity is specified in K grammars by means of one of two different\n+mechanisms. The first, and simplest, adds the associativity of a priority block\n+of symbols prior to that block. For example, we can remove the remaining\n+ambiguities in the above grammar like so:\n+\n+```k\n+syntax Exp ::= left:\n+               Exp \"*\" Exp\n+             | Exp \"/\" Exp\n+             > left:\n+               Exp \"+\" Exp\n+             | Exp \"-\" Exp\n+```", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "3de6656fe83383ba35a49a3c86b5c93947ca16c1"}, "originalPosition": 135}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDQ3NTU2MDEy", "url": "https://github.com/kframework/k/pull/1424#pullrequestreview-447556012", "createdAt": "2020-07-13T19:56:25Z", "commit": {"oid": "3de6656fe83383ba35a49a3c86b5c93947ca16c1"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNy0xM1QxOTo1NjoyNVrOGw3mDQ==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNy0xM1QxOTo1NjoyNVrOGw3mDQ==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ1Mzg5NTY5Mw==", "bodyText": "Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n            Here `foo(0)` is defined explicitly as 0.

A production declared with the `syntax` keyword in K is both a\n+piece of syntax used when parsing, and a symbol that is used when rewriting.\n+As a result, it is generally convenient to describe expression grammars using\n+priority and associativity declarations rather than explicitly transforming\n+your grammar into a series of nonterminals, one for each level of operator\n+precedence. Thus, for example, a simple grammar for addition and multiplication\n+will look like this:\n+\n+```k\n+syntax Exp ::= Exp \"*\" Exp\n+             | Exp \"+\" Exp\n+```\n+\n+However, this grammar is ambiguous. The term `x+y*z` might refer to `x+(y*z)`\n+or to `(x+y)*z`. In order to differentiate this, we introduce a partial\n+ordering between productions known as priority. A symbol \"has tighter priority\"\n+than another symbol if the first symbol can appear under the second, but the\n+second cannot appear under the first without a bracket. For example, in \n+traditional arithmetic, multiplication has tighter priority than addition,\n+which means that `x+y*z` cannot parse as `(x+y)*z` because the addition\n+operator would appear directly beneath the multiplication, which is forbidden\n+by the priority filter.\n+\n+Priority is applied individually to each possible ambiguous parse of a term. It\n+then either accepts or rejects that parse. If there is only a single remaining\n+parse (after all the other disambiguation steps have happened), this is the\n+parse that is chosen. If all the parses were rejected, it is a parse error. If\n+multiple parses remain, they might be resolved by further disambiguation such\n+as via the `prefer` and `avoid` attributes, but if multiple parses remain after\n+disambiguation finishes, this is an ambiguous parse error, indicating there is\n+not a unique parse for that term. In the vast majority of cases, this is\n+an error and indicates that you ought to either change your grammar or add\n+brackets to the term in question. \n+\n+Priority is specified in K grammars by means of one of two different\n+mechanisms. The first, and simplest, simply replaces the `|` operator in a \n+sequence of K productions with the `>` operator. This operator indicates that\n+everything prior to the `>` operator (including transitively) binds tighter\n+than what comes after. For example, a more complete grammar for simple\n+arithmetic might be:\n+\n+```k\n+syntax Exp ::= Exp \"*\" Exp\n+             | Exp \"/\" Exp\n+             > Exp \"+\" Exp\n+             | Exp \"-\" Exp\n+```\n+\n+This indicates that multiplication and division bind tigher than addition\n+and subtraction, but that there is no relationship in priority between\n+multiplication and division.\n+\n+As you may have noticed, this grammar is also ambiguous. `x*y/z` might refer to\n+`x*(y/z)` or to `(x*y)/z`. Indeed, if we removed division and subtraction\n+entirely, the grammar would still be ambiguous: `x*y*z` might parse as\n+`x*(y*z)`, or as `(x*y)*z`. To resolve this, we introduce another feature:\n+associativity. Roughly, asssociativity tells us how symbols are allowed to nest\n+within other symbols with the same priority. If a set of symbols is left\n+associative, then symbols in that set cannot appear as the rightmost child\n+of other symbols in that set. If a set of symbols is right associative, then\n+symbols in that set cannot appear as the leftmost child of other symbols in\n+that set. Finally, if a set of symbols is non-associative, then symbols\n+in that set cannot appear as the rightmost or leftmost child of other symbols\n+in that set. For example, in the above example, if addition and subtraction\n+are left associative, then `x+y+z` will parse as `(x+y)+`z and `x+y-z` will\n+parse as `(x+y)-z` (because the other parse will have been rejected).\n+\n+You might notice that this seems to apply only to binary infix operators. In\n+fact, the real behavior is slightly more complicated. Priority and\n+associativity (for technical reasons that go beyond the scope of this document)\n+really only apply when the rightmost or leftmost item in a production is a\n+nonterminal. If the rightmost nonterminal is followed by a terminal (or\n+respectively the leftmost preceded), priority and associativity do not apply.\n+Thus we can generalize these concepts to arbitrary context-free grammars.\n+\n+Associativity is specified in K grammars by means of one of two different\n+mechanisms. The first, and simplest, adds the associativity of a priority block\n+of symbols prior to that block. For example, we can remove the remaining\n+ambiguities in the above grammar like so:\n+\n+```k\n+syntax Exp ::= left:\n+               Exp \"*\" Exp\n+             | Exp \"/\" Exp\n+             > right:\n+               Exp \"+\" Exp\n+             | Exp \"-\" Exp\n+```\n+\n+This indicates that multiplication and division are left-associative, ie, after\n+symbols with higher priority are parsed as innermost, symbols are nested with\n+the rightmost on top.
