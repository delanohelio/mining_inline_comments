It is recommended to do these in the indicated order, because K features already discussed in a previous language definition will likely not be rediscussed in latter definitions. The screencasts follow quite closely the structure of the files under the [tutorial folder](https://github.com/kframework/k/tree/master/k-distribution/tutorial) in the K tool distribution. If you'd rather follow the instructions there and do the tutorial exercises yourself, then go back to http://kframework.org and download the K tool, if you have not done it already. Or, you can first watch the screencasts below and then do the exercises, or do them in parallel.\n+\n+## K Overview\n+\n+Make sure you watch the K overview video before you do the K tutorial:\n+\n+- [9'59\"] [K Overview](./overview.md)\n+\n+## Learning K\n+\n+### [34'46\"]   Part 1: Defining LAMBDA\n+\n+Here you will learn how to define a very simple functional language in K and the basics of how to use the K tool.
