The route may be optimized to reduce overall travel time or travel distance. If stops are added to an existing route, it may be more efficient to reorder the stops to achieve the most efficient route.\n+You can define barriers to avoid unsafe areas, for example flooded roads, when planning the most efficient route to evacuate a hurricane zone. When solving a route, barriers allow you to define portions of the road network that cannot be traversed. You could also use this functionality to plan routes when you know an area will be inaccessible due to a community activity like an organized race or a market night.\n+\n+In some situations, it is further beneficial to find the most efficient route that reaches all stops, reordering them to reduce travel time. For example, a delivery service may target a number of drop-off addresses, specifically looking to avoid congested areas or closed roads, arranging the stops in the most time-effective order.\n \n ## How to use the sample\n \n-Use the Edit Mode toggle buttons to select whether to add Stops or Barriers to the route.
