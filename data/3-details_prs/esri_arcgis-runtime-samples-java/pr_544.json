However reviewing the common designs, Java was already a bit different before these additional changes, so have left as is for now. But would appreciate this being checked as not sure if there's a reason it was different in the first place. Can update to match the design if not.\n\n\nFeature Layer Shapefile (feature layers)\nUpdated How to Use section\n\n\nToken Authentication (portal)\nAdded Additional information section\n\n\nCS repo issue 2155\n\n\nFeature Layer Selection (feature layers)\nReordering of 2 sections done\n\n\nList Transformations by suitability (geometry)\nIn this case I added in the entire Additional information section from the common samples repo, including the recent update from the Issue.
