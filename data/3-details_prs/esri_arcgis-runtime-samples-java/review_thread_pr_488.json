You can get suggestions and locations for these places of interest (POIs) using a natural language query. Additionally, you can filter the results to a specific area.\n \n ## How to use the sample\n \n-Choose from the dropdown or input your own place and location to search near. Click the search button to find matching places. A redo search button will appear if you pan the map after a search.\n+Choose a type of place in the first field and an area to search within in the second field. Click the 'Search' button to show the results of the query on the map. Click on a result pin to show its name and address. If you pan away from the result area, the \"Redo search in this area\" button at the bottom of the screen will become active. Click it to query again for the currently viewed area on the map.\n \n ## How it works\n \n-To find locations matching a query and a search area:\n-\n-1. Create an `ArcGISMap`'s with `Basemap`.\n-    * basemap is created using a `TileCache` to represent an offline resource.\n-2. Add the map to the `MapView`, `MapView.setMap()`.\n-3. Create a `LocatorTask` using a URL and set the `GeocodeParameters`.\n-4. To reverse geocode near a location, pass the location's position into `GeocodeParameters.setSearchArea(Geometry)` to set the search area.\n-5. Limit results to the view's visible area using the `MapView.getVisibleArea()` method.\n-6. Show the matching retrieved results from the `LocatorTask.geocodeAsync(String, GeocodeParameters)` via `PictureMarkerSymbol`s with a `Graphic` in a `GraphicsOverlay`.\n+1. Create a `LocatorTask` using a URL to a locator service.\n+2. Find the location for an address (or city name) to build an envelope to search within:\n+    * Create `GeocodeParameters`.\n+    * Add return fields to the parameters' `resultAttributeNames` collection. Only add a single \"\\*\" option to return all fields.\n+    * Call `locatorTask.geocodeAsync(locationQueryString, geocodeParameters)` to get a list of `GeocodeResult`s.\n+    * Use the `displayLocation` from each of the results to build an `Envelope` to view.\n+3.
