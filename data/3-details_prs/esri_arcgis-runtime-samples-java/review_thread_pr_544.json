Does the code require updating? If not then we can just reword to avoid specifically saying that our samples uses the GeographicTransformation: but you should probably double check the wording with the author of the common sample readme to be sure this still delivers the message intended.\n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n\n  \n  This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.
