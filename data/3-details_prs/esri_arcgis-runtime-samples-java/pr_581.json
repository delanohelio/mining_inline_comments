To accommodate this this group also has a toggle group and radio buttons in the TreeView.\nThere was also an issue noted for the Java sample in relation to this sample, about the pathways layer showing underneath the development project area. This has been fixed by the way the 2 layers are now grouped and layered on the operational layers.\nOne thing I noted is that the layers themselves are loaded in the buildLayersView method, so I think they are added to the TreeView at the rate they are loaded, which can vary so they aren't always displayed in the list in the same order. If we want this to be consistent between the order on the scene and UI, then a bit like with the operational layers sample, we'd need to load each layer before that method and then reverse the order they're added to the TreeView. Personally not sure the additional code is worth is to keep the focus on the Group Layers but let me know if you want to discuss this more. I'll also show at Review later.\n\nChecklist:\n\n Set target branch to master (current release) or dev (next release)\n Request a reviewer\n Assign a reviewer\n Tag reviewer in comment", "createdAt":
