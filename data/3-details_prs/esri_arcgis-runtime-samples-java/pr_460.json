Start with a list of the rood nodes with `kmlDataset.getRootNodes()`.\n-3. For each node, check if it is a `KmlContainer` or `KmlNetworkLink`. These types can have child nodes.

Explore the root nodes of the `KmlDataset` recursively explored to create a view model.\n+  * Each node is enabled for display at this step.
