The API key task creates a gradle.properties file in the .gradle folder if one doesn't already exist. The API key is set as a system property in the run task to allow the key to be used within in the samples.\nSome things I would like some feedback on:\n\nAdded some instructions to the README on API keys. Are the IDE instructions clear?\nFor the terminal instructions, I followed the existing convention and added the step ./gradlew build, which would create the  gradle.properties file. When testing out that command or ./gradlew run, I got the error Could not find or load main class org.gradle.wrapper.GradleWrapperMain. To run ./gradlew run, I had to run the wrapper task before hand, which also creates the gradle.properties file. The issue is documented here. Should I replace ./gradlew build with gradle wrapper?\n\n@JonLavi", "createdAt": "2020-11-24T16:08:51Z", "url": "https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-samples-java/pull/593", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "04980006ae2008773d71e91e9c30c57e45dd1300"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-12-08T15:36:07Z", "author": {"login": "sclaridge"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 25, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABdfn4fIgH2gAyNTI2NTk0NDUzOmM3OWY0OWFjZWMyNzgxMWMxZjRiZDcwNGQ1MzNlMTcwN2NiZWJkOTg=", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABdkLW-1AFqTU0NzMwOTE3Mg==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "c79f49acec27811c1f4bd704d533e1707cbebd98", "author": {"user": {"login": "sclaridge", "name": "Simone Claridge"}}, "url": "https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-samples-java/commit/c79f49acec27811c1f4bd704d533e1707cbebd98", "committedDate": "2020-11-24T11:16:53Z", "message": "Add API key task and system property"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "240a6116289d17f460e3f4622b693d7766e555cc", "author": {"user": {"login": "sclaridge", "name": "Simone Claridge"}}, "url": "https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-samples-java/commit/240a6116289d17f460e3f4622b693d7766e555cc", "committedDate": "2020-11-24T14:18:44Z", "message": "Add group and description to api key task"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "aa14d78e9beeb8cdaebc557a2a1bc6a4e74adcb9", "author": {"user": {"login": "sclaridge", "name": "Simone Claridge"}}, "url": "https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-samples-java/commit/aa14d78e9beeb8cdaebc557a2a1bc6a4e74adcb9", "committedDate": "2020-11-24T14:20:25Z", "message": "Add API key details to readme"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "223ed572e6911837bf2faf928d7876d58459afea", "author": {"user": {"login": "sclaridge", "name": "Simone Claridge"}}, "url": "https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-samples-java/commit/223ed572e6911837bf2faf928d7876d58459afea", "committedDate": "2020-11-24T14:35:16Z", "message": "Tidy comment"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "feaa83bc0867875dac72e186462d56fca4f186ad", "author": {"user": {"login": "sclaridge", "name": "Simone Claridge"}}, "url": "https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-samples-java/commit/feaa83bc0867875dac72e186462d56fca4f186ad", "committedDate": "2020-11-24T14:57:23Z", "message": "Tidy url"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "7492c70b4b0af5ed8a7a0c5a3a54ea3511bde149", "author": {"user": {"login": "sclaridge", "name": "Simone Claridge"}}, "url": "https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-samples-java/commit/7492c70b4b0af5ed8a7a0c5a3a54ea3511bde149", "committedDate": "2020-11-24T14:57:43Z", "message": "Fix link and reorder list"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "26bed04b6b6972bc8f65c0a120b56f93babdb8f6", "author": {"user": {"login": "sclaridge", "name": "Simone Claridge"}}, "url": "https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-samples-java/commit/26bed04b6b6972bc8f65c0a120b56f93babdb8f6", "committedDate": "2020-11-30T16:23:55Z", "message": "Remove unnecessary API key task"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "526efbea1391e2046d741ac21dcfb3783a26ebb4", "author": {"user": {"login": "sclaridge", "name": "Simone Claridge"}}, "url": "https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-samples-java/commit/526efbea1391e2046d741ac21dcfb3783a26ebb4", "committedDate": "2020-11-30T16:39:24Z", "message": "Add ArcGIS identity info to README"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NTQxNzMyMTMz", "url": "https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-samples-java/pull/593#pullrequestreview-541732133", "createdAt": "2020-12-01T09:56:41Z", "commit": {"oid": "526efbea1391e2046d741ac21dcfb3783a26ebb4"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 7, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMi0wMVQwOTo1Njo0MlrOH8jPYg==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMi0wMVQxMDoxMjo1OVrOH8ka2w==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUzMzI1Mzk4Ng==", "bodyText": "The numbering here is out of order.\nRegarding your comment in the main issue, I was under the impression that we gitignore the wrapper file, but that doesn't actually seem to be the case:\nhttps://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-samples-java/tree/master/analysis/analyze-hotspots/gradle/wrapper\nAll samples have the wrapper and properties file on github, I think, so it seems like users should have the wrapper and could just go ahead..
