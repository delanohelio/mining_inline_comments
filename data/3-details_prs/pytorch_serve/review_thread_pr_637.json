However, Torchserve is specifically tuned for Pytorch models. It also has new features like Snapshot and model versioning.\n+\n+## Deployment and config\n+Relevant documents.\n+- [Torchserve configuration](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/docs/configuration.md)\n+- [Model zoo](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/docs/model_zoo.md#model-zoo)\n+- [Snapshot](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/docs/snapshot.md)\n+- [Docker]([https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/docker/README.md](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/docker/README.md))\n+\n+### Can I run Torchserve APIs on ports other than the default 8080 & 8081?\n+Yes, Torchserve API ports are configurable using a properties file or environment variable.\n+Refer [configuration.md](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/docs/configuration.md) for more details.\n+\n+\n+### How can I resolve model specific python dependency?\n+You can provide a requirements.txt while creating a mar file using \"--requirements-file/ -r\" flag. Also, you can add dependency files using \"--extra-files\" flag.\n+Refer [configuration.md](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/docs/configuration.md) for more details.\n+\n+### Can I deploy Torchserve in Kubernetes?\n+Yes, you can deploy Torchserve in Kubernetes using Helm charts.\n+Refer [Kubernetes deployment ](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/kubernetes/README.md) for more details.\n+\n+### Can I deploy Torchserve with AWS ELB and AWS ASG?\n+Yes, you can deploy Torchserve on a multinode ASG AWS EC2 cluster. There is a cloud formation template available [here](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/cloudformation/ec2-asg.yaml) for this type of deployment. Refer [ Multi-node EC2 deployment behind Elastic LoadBalancer (ELB)](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/tree/master/cloudformation#multi-node-ec2-deployment-behind-elastic-loadbalancer-elb) more details.\n+\n+### How can I backup and restore Torchserve state?\n+TorchServe preserves server runtime configuration across sessions such that a TorchServe instance experiencing either a planned or unplanned service stop can restore its state upon restart. These saved runtime configuration files can be used for backup and restore.\n+Refer [TorchServe model snapshot](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/docs/snapshot.md#torchserve-model-snapshot) for more details.\n+\n+### How can I build a Torchserve image from source?\n+Torchserve has a utility [script]([https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/docker/build_image.sh](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/docker/build_image.sh)) for creating docker images, the docker image can be hardware-based CPU or GPU compatible.

Checkout out Torchserve [Model Zoo](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/docs/model_zoo.md) for list of all available models. You can also check out the [examples](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/tree/master/examples) folder.\n+\n+### Does Torchserve has Windows Support?\n+Currently, Torchserve supports Windows only via WSL(Windows Subsystem for Linux). The native Windows support will be added in upcoming releases.\n+\n+### Can I do streaming service with Torchserve like streaming speech recognition?\n+Torchserve currently supports only inference through HTTP 1.0 - Request / Response style.\n+\n+### Does Torchserve support other models based on programming languages other than python?\n+No, As of now only python based models are supported.\n+\n+### What benefits does Torchserve have over AWS Multi-Model-Server?\n+Torchserve is derived from Multi-Model-Server. However, Torchserve is specifically tuned for Pytorch models. It also has new features like Snapshot and model versioning.\n+\n+## Deployment and config\n+Relevant documents.\n+- [Torchserve configuration](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/docs/configuration.md)\n+- [Model zoo](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/docs/model_zoo.md#model-zoo)\n+- [Snapshot](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/docs/snapshot.md)\n+- [Docker]([https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/docker/README.md](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/docker/README.md))\n+\n+### Can I run Torchserve APIs on ports other than the default 8080 & 8081?\n+Yes, Torchserve API ports are configurable using a properties file or environment variable.\n+Refer [configuration.md](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/docs/configuration.md) for more details.\n+\n+\n+### How can I resolve model specific python dependency?\n+You can provide a requirements.txt while creating a mar file using \"--requirements-file/ -r\" flag.
