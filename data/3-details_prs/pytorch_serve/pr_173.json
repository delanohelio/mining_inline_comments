TorchServe use following order to locate this `config.properties` file:\n-1. if `TS_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable is set, TorchServe will load the configuration from the environment variable.\n-2. if `--ts-config` parameter is passed to `torchserve`, TorchServe will load the configuration from the parameter.\n-3. if there is a `config.properties` in current folder where user start the `torchserve`, TorchServe will load the `config.properties` file form current working directory.\n-4.

TorchServe uses following, in order of priority, to locate this `config.properties` file:\n+\n+1. If the `TS_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable is set, TorchServe loads the configuration from the path specified by the environment variable.\n+2.

If there is a `config.properties` in the folder where you call `torchserve`, TorchServe loads the `config.properties` file from the current working directory.\n+4. If none of the above is specified, TorchServe loads a built-in configuration with default values.\n \n ### Customize JVM options\n \n-The restrict TorchServe frontend memory footprint, certain JVM options is set via **vmargs** property in `config.properties` file\n+To control TorchServe frontend memory footprint, configure the **vmargs** property in the `config.properties` file\n \n * default: N/A, use JVM default options\n \n-User can adjust those JVM options for fit their memory requirement if needed.\n+Adjust JVM options to fit your memory requirement.\n \n ### Load models at startup\n \n-User can configure load models while TorchServe startup. TorchServe can load models from `model_store` or from HTTP(s) URL.\n-\n-* model_store\n-\t* standalone: default: N/A, load models from local disk is disabled. Following syntax can be used to configure lost of models to be loaded on startup :\n-\t\n-```python\n-# load all models present in model store\n-load_models=all\n-# load models from model store with mar names only\n-load_models=model1.mar,model2.mar\n-# load models from model store with model name and mar file\n-load_models=model1=model1.mar,model2=model2.mar\n-```\n+You can configure TorchServe to load models during startup by setting the `model_store` and `load_models` properties.\n+The following values are valid:\n \n-* load_models\n-\t* standalone: default: N/A, no models will be load on startup.\n-```python\n-model_store=<path to model store directory which stores the local mar files.>\n-```\n+* `load_models`\n+  * `standalone`: default: N/A, No models are loaded at start up.\n+  * `all`: Load all models present in `model_store`.\n+  * `model1.mar, model2.mar`: Load models in the specified MAR files from `model_store`.\n+  * `model1=model1.mar, model2=model2.mar`: Load models with the specified names and MAR files from `model_store`.\n \n-**Note:** `model_store` and `load_models` property can be override by command line parameters.\n+* `model_store`\n+  * `standalone`: default: N/A, Loading models from the local disk is disabled.\n+  * `pathname`: The model store location is specified by the value of `pathname`.\n+\n+**Note:** `model_store` and `load_models` properties are overridden by command line parameters, if specified.\n \n ### Configure TorchServe listening address and port\n \n-TorchServe doesn't support authentication natively. To avoid unauthorized access, TorchServe only allows localhost access by default. Inference API is listening on 8080 port and accepting HTTP request.
