Does this mean before creating the script, or before the script runs? I have made a suggestion based on it meaning \"before the script runs\". Please revise if you mean something different. How does one set a reasonable output, and what would \"reasonable\" be? I'm also not sure what \"event reason\" means.\n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n\n  \n  This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.
