Each tenant schema is in a separate tenant specific tablespace. \n+\n+### Schema: Administrative\n+\n+The administrative schema's name is FHIR_ADMIN.  FHIR_ADMIN has \n+- three tables: TENANTS, TENANT_KEYS, VERSION_HISTORY\n+- one sequence: FHIR_ADMIN.TENANT_SEQUENCE\n+- one stored procedure: SET_TENANT\n+\n+The tables have supporting indicies and privileges. \n+\n+**Table: TENANTS**\n+\n+The Tenants table maps a given tenant to the Multi-Tenant ID (MT_ID) for the given tenant.  The MT_ID is subsequently used to restrict row access based on the matching value. \n+\n+| Column Name | Data Type | Length | Null | Purpose |\n+|----------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------|\n+| MT_ID | Integer | 4 | No | Unique ID identifying the Tenant's ID|\n+| TENANT_NAME | VARCHAR | 36 | No | The name of the tenant |\n+| TENANT_STATUS | VARCHAR | 16 | No | The status of the Tenant|\n+\n+MT_ID is the value used to assign ROW Access Control in the Multi-Tenant schema. The MT_ID is assigned from the FHIR_ADMIN.TENANT_SEQUENCE.  The value is to 1 to 9999, with no cycles. \n+\n+Tenant Status is one of the following: \n+| Status | Purpose |\n+|----------|---------------------------------------------|\n+| PROVISIONING | Indicates the tenant schema is in the process of adding a set of tenant tables/partitions |\n+| ALLOCATED | Indicates the process of creating the tenant schema is finished, and the schema is ready for use. Only allocated tenants are available for use in the `fhir-persistence-jdbc` code |\n+| FROZEN | Indicates the previous tenant data is not to be used, and the tenant data is in the process of being removed |\n+| DROPPED | Indicates the previous tenant data is now removed |\n+| FREE | Indicates a set of tables is provisioned, and available to be allocated to a specific tenant |\n+\n+**Table: TENANT_KEYS**\n+\n+The Tenant Keys table stores a hashed version of the tenant specific key. Upon creating a session and calling the SET_TENANT procedure, the SET_TENANT queries the incoming key against the TENANT_KEYS database to map to a specific tenant MT_ID. \n+\n+| Column Name | Data Type | Length | Null | Purpose |\n+|----------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------|\n+| TENANT_KEY_ID | Integer | 4 | No | The ID is from the sequence, and is used to identify the unique entry in the row |\n+| MT_ID | Integer | 4 | No | Matches to the MT_ID in the TENANTS table |\n+| TENANT_SALT | VARCHAR | 44 | No | A 32 byte random value used as a salt when computing the SHA-256 tenant hash |\n+| TENANT_HASH | VARBINARY | 32 | No | Each tenant's data is encrypted. |\n+\n+The tenant_key is a 32 byte random value created when the tenant is provisioned. This is a secret, and must be passed by the client to the database in order to obtain access to a tenant. A tenant may have multiple tenant keys to support key rotation. An example of the tenant key is `GQUHRi0ETFw0Xe+p1VtVDki4JFZs885bGM35hXRyq/E=`\n+\n+Multiple keys per tenant are supported, and key rotation includes adding, and then subsequently removing prior keys. \n+\n+**Table: VERSION_HISTORY**\n+\n+The VERSION_HISTORY table enables Tenant version isolation, so upgrades and patches are separately applied to the schema the tenant belongs. Specifically, if the tenant shares the table definitions with another client, the patching is applied to both tenants at the same time.  If the tenant has a specific schema, the table definitions may be updated independent of each other. \n+\n+| Column Name | Data Type | Length | Null | Purpose |\n+|----------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------|\n+| SCHEMA_NAME | VARCHAR | 64 | No | The name of the schema where the object resides|\n+| OBJECT_TYPE | VARCHAR | 16 | No | The type of the object - Procedure, Sequence, Table, TableSpace, Variable |\n+| OBJECT_NAME | VARCHAR | 64 | No | The name of the object in the schema |\n+| VERSION | INTEGER | 4 | No | The version starting at one and incrementing with every version change |\n+| APPLIED | TIMESTAMP | 10 | No | The time of the latest object update |\n+\n+### Schema: Tenant-Specific\n+\n+The Tenant specific data is partitioned and isolated in a customer specific tablespace.  The tenant data is not mixed with other tenant data physically using the tablespace isolation. \n+\n+Tenants are never able to see each other's data, each user is only able to see a single tenant's data. The IBM FHIR Server uses the [CREATE PERMISSION statement](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHRBY/com.ibm.swg.im.dashdb.sql.ref.doc/doc/r0057429.html) to create a row permission that specifies a condition under which rows of the table can be accessed. \n+\n+The condition to access the content is based on the SQL variable FHIR_ADMIN.SV_TENANT_ID joined with each table's MT_ID (multi-tenant id). If you need to query all tenants, you need to write a specific stored procedure to loop over the tenant_ids and query the table with each variable set with each tenant_id, and aggregate in the stored procedure. \n+\n+Each tenant's data is able to be moved, backedup, restored or exported a tenant-at-a-time.  This approach allows tenant independent restore points, using [DB2 11.1: Backing up partitioned databases](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEPGG_11.1.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.admin.ha.doc/doc/t0051366.html)\n+\n+The isolated data supports tenant independent query plan caches, scaling and disambiguating tenant specific disk and space usage. The performance metrics are tenant specific, and diagnostics are tenant specific. \n+\n+**Table: Resources**\n+\n+Each resource is contains a RESOURCE and LOGICAL RESOURCE table. `_LOGICAL_RESOURCES` has one record per logical resource.  `_RESOURCES` has one record for each version of each logical resource. \n+\n+For example, VISIONPRESCRIPTION has: \n+\n+```\n+VISIONPRESCRIPTION_RESOURCES\n+VISIONPRESCRIPTION_LOGICAL_RESOURCES\n+```\n+\n+These values are mapped to specific FHIR Search value types, supporting parameter searches: \n+\n+```\n+VISIONPRESCRIPTION_COMPOSITES\n+VISIONPRESCRIPTION_DATE_VALUES\n+VISIONPRESCRIPTION_LATLNG_VALUES\n+VISIONPRESCRIPTION_NUMBER_VALUES\n+VISIONPRESCRIPTION_QUANTITY_VALUES\n+VISIONPRESCRIPTION_STR_VALUES\n+VISIONPRESCRIPTION_TOKEN_VALUES\n+```\n+\n+There are also additional tables to support search: `LOGICAL_RESOURCE`, `RESOURCE_TYPES` and `PARAMETER_NAMES` These tables are paritioned, and are specific for each tenant. \n+\n+**Table: Global: LOGICAL_RESOURCE**\n+\n+This table facilitates global search optimizations. \n+\n+| Column Name | Data Type | Length | Null | Purpose |\n+|----------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------|\n+| MT_ID | Integer | 4 | No | Matches to the MT_ID in the TENANTS table |\n+| LOGICAL_RESOURCE_ID | Integer | 8 | No | The ID is from the sequence, and is used to identify the unique entry in the specific Resource row |\n+| RESOURCE_TYPE_ID | VARCHAR | 44 | No | Associates a Resource with a Resource Type using the value from the Resource Types table |\n+| LOGICAL_ID | VARCHAR | 255 | No | The unique tenant specific UUID assigned to the Resource |\n+\n+**Table: Global: RESOURCE_TYPES**\n+\n+The tenant specific table of resources, which are mapped to bigints as FKs to optimize global search. \n+\n+| Column Name | Data Type | Length | Null | Purpose |\n+|----------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------|\n+| MT_ID | Integer | 4 | No | Matches to the MT_ID in the TENANTS table |\n+| RESOURCE_TYPE_ID | Integer | 4 | No | A unique Identifier identifying the type of the resource |\n+| RESOURCE_TYPE | VARCHAR | 32 | No | Each ResourceType |\n+\n+**Table: Global: PARAMETER_NAMES**\n+\n+The PARAMETER_NAMES table registers, for each tenant, a mapping from the Search Parameter `code` to an `integer`, which is used in the values table to uniquely identify the parameter name.  The parameters are only registered on extraction (Create, Update), and not populated on Search. \n+\n+| Column Name | Data Type | Length | Null | Purpose |\n+|----------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------|\n+| MT_ID | Integer | 4 | No | Matches to the MT_ID in the TENANTS table |\n+| PARAMETER_NAME_ID | INTEGER | 4 | No | A unique integer for each parameter, and is stored along with the value in the Parameters VALUES table for each resource |\n+| PARAMETER_NAME | VARCHAR | 255 | No | The Parameter name which actually maps to the FHIR SearchParameter `code` |\n+\n+Each row is secured using Db2 Row Permission. The Stored Procedure is the ONLY way for a user to set the variable, which is used in the Db2 Row Permission. \n+\n+Each tenant's data is encrypted.  For Db2 on Cloud, it uses Db2 native encryption. This means there is a single key that encrypts all the tenants. There is currently no way to encrypt each tenant's tablespace with a different key.\n+\n+Offboarding a tenant's data is accomplished using dettach/drop partition, and subsequently dropping the tablespace. \n+\n+**Stored Procedure: FHIR_ADMIN.SET_TENANT**\n+\n+The FHIR_ADMIN.SET_TENANT is used at the beginning of a connection to the IBM FHIR Server's multi-tenant schema. The SET_TENANT takes as input: tenant_name VARCHAR(36), tenant_key  VARCHAR(44).  The content outputs a connection specific variable `fhir_admin.sv_tenant_id` with the `tenant.mt_id`, which is automatically applied to the INSERT,SELECT,UPDATE,DELETE.  Only tenant's with status ALLOCATED are allowed to execute the actions.\n+\n+To use the stored procedure from the Db2 administrative console. \n+\n+* Map Tenant and Key to Tenant ID (Stored Procedure) - `CALL FHIR_ADMIN.set_tenant('a-tenant-name', 'BLAH_BLAH');`\n+* Show the value set for the session - `VALUES fhir_admin.sv_tenant_id;`\n+* Execute the query, such as `SELECT * FROM FHIRDATA.MEDICATION_RESOURCES`\n+\n+**Schema: Permissions**\n+\n+The Multi-tenant schema sets the following permissions: \n+- All objects in schema FHIR_ADMIN are owned by user FHIRADMIN\n+- All objects in schema FHIRDATA are owned by user FHIRADMIN\n+- GRANT EXECUTE ON FHIR_ADMIN.SET_TENANT TO FHIRSERVER;\n+- GRANT READ ON FHIR_ADMIN.SV_TENANT_ID TO FHIRSERVER;\n+- GRANT EXECUTE ON FHIRDATA.ADD_RESOURCE_TYPE TO FHIRSERVER;\n+- GRANT EXECUTE ON FHIRDATA.ADD_RESOURCE TO FHIRSERVER;\n+- GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE ON FHIRDATA.PATIENT_RESOURCES TO FHIRSERVER;\n+\n+FHIR_ADMIN owns all schema objects.
