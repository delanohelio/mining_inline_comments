Create your PR from that branch.\n Add JavaDocs and other comments\n Write tests that run and pass in CI. See CONTRIBUTING.md for details on how to capture snapshot data.\n Run mvn clean compile locally. This may reformat your code, commit those changes.\n Run mvn -D enable-ci clean install site locally.
