However, sessions guarantee that the requests would be executed \"in-order\" on the server but they don't guarantee that the results would be returned in order as well because the results are handled by different executor threads completing different futures.\nI fixed the test to not rely on order of the result but still check for order on the server.", "createdAt": "2020-11-20T22:56:49Z", "url": "https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1365", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "710d573e23da7c6ef7e84ee3115c9b59bd1c6b0b"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-11-27T19:23:11Z", "author": {"login": "divijvaidya"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABdefdL9AH2gAyNTI0OTk2NDQ2OjJjNWRhZWM0YThiZjVmNWFiNmU5ZDlkNzU0YzM1ODMwZWE0OGM3ZGI=", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABdfTf2EAFqTUzNjM4ODE3Ng==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "2c5daec4a8bf5f5ab6e9d9d754c35830ea48c7db", "author": {"user": {"login": "divijvaidya", "name": "Divij Vaidya"}}, "url": "https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/commit/2c5daec4a8bf5f5ab6e9d9d754c35830ea48c7db", "committedDate": "2020-11-20T22:53:54Z", "message": "Fix stochastic nature of shouldProcessSessionRequestsInOrder"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NTM2Mzg4MTc2", "url": "https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1365#pullrequestreview-536388176", "createdAt": "2020-11-23T11:31:52Z", "commit": {"oid": "2c5daec4a8bf5f5ab6e9d9d754c35830ea48c7db"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0yM1QxMTozMTo1MlrOH4JfHQ==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0yM1QxMTozMTo1MlrOH4JfHQ==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyODYzNzcyNQ==", "bodyText": "just to clarify , by \"different executor thread\" are you referring to threads on the client being responsible for the un-ordering?", "url": "https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1365#discussion_r528637725", "createdAt": "2020-11-23T11:31:52Z", "author": {"login": "spmallette"}, "path": "gremlin-server/src/test/java/org/apache/tinkerpop/gremlin/server/GremlinDriverIntegrateTest.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -612,40 +612,42 @@ public void shouldProcessRequestsOutOfOrder() throws Exception {\n         }\n     }\n \n+    /**\n+     * This test validates that the session requests are processed in-order on the server.
