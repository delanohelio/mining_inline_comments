Depending on the state machine type, states and/or transitions produce outputs.\r\n+* `AllowsConstraint:` should specify the states that are allowed to be activated while the parent state is active.\r\n+* `ForbidsConstraint:` should specify the states that are forbidden while the parent state is active.\r\n+\r\n+In the following we will create a mass budget. Create a project - in the following called `MySatellite` - and activate the following concepts\r\n+\r\n+* `de.dlr.sc.virsat.model.extension.statemachines`\r\n+* `de.dlr.sc.virsat.model.extension.ps`\r\n+\r\n+according to <<Activating a Concept>>.\r\n+\r\n+:step1: 0\r\n+[%header,cols=\">8,62a,40a\"] \r\n+|===\r\n+\r\n+|Step\r\n+|Task\r\n+|Image\r\n+\r\n+|{counter:step1}.\r\n+|First of all, the concepts _State Machines_ and _Product Structure_ need to be activated in the _Repository_.\r\n+|image:chapterStateMachines/1.png[AddStateMachineConcept]\r\n+\r\n+|{counter:step1}.\r\n+|For the system, create a _ConfigurationTree_ with a _ElementConfiguration_, and give it the name `AOCS` (Attitude and Orbit Control System). This shall serve only as an example.\r\n+|image:chapterStateMachines/2.png[CreatingAOCSElementConfiguration]\r\n+\r\n+|{counter:step1}.\r\n+|Now the `AOCS` shall for example contain components like a Camera as payload, as well as the Thrusters and Reaction Wheels for attitude control purposes. \r\n+\r\n+For this, add three _ElementConfiguration_ elements and give them the following names: `CAM`, `THR`, `RW`.\r\n+|image:chapterStateMachines/3.png[CreateSubcomponentsOfSystem]\r\n+\r\n+|{counter:step1}.\r\n+|Now create a _State Machine_ element for any of the system components. In the following a _State Machine_ is created for the Camera that shall be used in the science phase of the mission for collecting images data. \r\n+\r\n+Now you can add a state machine to the component `CAM` in the _Navigator_ with `Context` \u203a `State Machines` \u203a `Add StateMachine`.\r\n+\r\n+|image:chapterStateMachines/4.png[OpenDiagramEditor]\r\n+\r\n+|{counter:step1}.\r\n+|Having created a _State Machine_ for the camera, now open the _State Machine Diagram Editor_ in the _Navigator_ with `Context` \u203a `Open Diagram Editor`.\r\n+|image:chapterStateMachines/5.png[AddStateMachine]\r\n+\r\n+|{counter:step1}.\r\n+|The _Diagram Editor_ shall look as shown in the image. \r\n+|image:chapterStateMachines/DiagramEditor.png[DiagramEditor]\r\n+\r\n+|{counter:step1}.\r\n+|Now to add a _State_ (same for other objects in the _Diagram Palette_, i.e. `State`, `Transition`, `ForbidsConstraint`, ...), left click on the object in the Palette once and then left click again on the position in the diagram where you want to add it.\r\n+\r\n+The state machine diagram for the `CAM` object shall look as shown in the image.\r\n+|image:chapterStateMachines/AddState.png[AddState] \r\n+\r\n+|{counter:step1}.\r\n+|After creating a transition connection in the Diagram Editor, you want to create a _TransitionTriggerEvent_ and assign it to the previously created transition. \r\n+\r\n+Go in the _Editor_ using _SM_ instance in the _Navigator_: `Context` \u203a `Open Editor` or simply by double clicking on the _SM_ instance in the _Navigator_.\r\n+\r\n+In the _Editor_ if you press [Add TransitionTriggerEvent] button, a new trigger event is created. \r\n+\r\n+Name it under the column `Name`, and give it a description under the `detail`.\r\n+\r\n+|image:chapterStateMachines/Open Editor.png[Open Editor] image:chapterStateMachines/AddTransitionTriggerEvent.png[AddTransitionTriggerEvent]\r\n+\r\n+|{counter:step1}.\r\n+|Now assign the created trigger event to the `Transition` you created in the diagram. Under `trigger` column in the `transitions` section, you can choose a trigger action from the list as shown in the image.\r\n+\r\n+NOTE: Transitions can be created or removed in the _Diagram Editor_, but also manually in the normal _Editor_.\r\n+\r\n+|image:chapterStateMachines/AssigningTriggers.png[AssigningTriggers] image:chapterStateMachines/OpenedWizardForTriggerActions.png[OpenedWizardForTriggerActions]\r\n+\r\n+|{counter:step1}.\r\n+|After assigning, go back to the _Diagram Editor_ and update the state machine diagram using the yellow button up right the _State Machine_ block, then you will be able to see the new transition.\r\n+|image:chapterStateMachines/UpdateStateMachine.png[UpdateStateMachine]\r\n+\r\n+|{counter:step1}.\r\n+|Now having created the various components of the system and described their behavior using state machines, the _State Machine_ for the `AOCS` system can be created in a newly created _ElementConfiguration_ namely `CONOPS` (standing for concept operations). This state machine shall describe the behavior of the whole system.\r", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "edde19448f0e1fb67785adc5e8f41c88fdcca231"}, "originalPosition": 90}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "f4c916785be8b977245bf832ca2825a40feff2b5", "author": {"user": {"login": "GeorgeNasrDLR", "name": null}}, "url": "https://github.com/virtualsatellite/VirtualSatellite4-Core/commit/f4c916785be8b977245bf832ca2825a40feff2b5", "committedDate": "2020-12-04T10:20:13Z", "message": "Adding some changes to the chapter considering the reviews - (Task #876)\n\n---\nTask #876: Add George to known authors"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "94fe593d1d96866bcdb512479b4c5979604d122d", "author": {"user": {"login": "GeorgeNasrDLR", "name": null}}, "url": "https://github.com/virtualsatellite/VirtualSatellite4-Core/commit/94fe593d1d96866bcdb512479b4c5979604d122d", "committedDate": "2020-12-04T10:32:42Z", "message": "Merge branch 'features/task_850-Create_a_Concept_Chap' of https://github.com/virtualsatellite/VirtualSatellite4-Core.git into feature/task_850-Create_a_Concept_Chapter_StateMachine"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "c87f5659a469d1ff14be1de3a293cd59f0ff4ca4", "author": {"user": {"login": "GeorgeNasrDLR", "name": null}}, "url": "https://github.com/virtualsatellite/VirtualSatellite4-Core/commit/c87f5659a469d1ff14be1de3a293cd59f0ff4ca4", "committedDate": "2020-12-04T10:34:20Z", "message": "Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/development' into feature/task_850-Create_a_Concept_Chapter_StateMachine"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "742f3c40b2ba56966e588a7fbf46c6a22940dfbe", "author": {"user": {"login": "GeorgeNasrDLR", "name": null}}, "url": "https://github.com/virtualsatellite/VirtualSatellite4-Core/commit/742f3c40b2ba56966e588a7fbf46c6a22940dfbe", "committedDate": "2020-12-04T15:42:46Z", "message": "Updating the image warnings - (Task #883)\n\n---\nTask #883: Adding George To State Machine Concept Chapter"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "ab0ba0a38cd38f220dbd52fe7a5965fec5da8054", "author": {"user": {"login": "GeorgeNasrDLR", "name": null}}, "url": "https://github.com/virtualsatellite/VirtualSatellite4-Core/commit/ab0ba0a38cd38f220dbd52fe7a5965fec5da8054", "committedDate": "2020-12-05T08:37:44Z", "message": "Fixing the warnings with the images - (Task #883)\n\n---\nTask #883: Adding George To Chapter State Machines in the manual"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "7d8ddaea975dd8b69868f7087df7172301b47daf", "author": {"user": {"login": "GeorgeNasrDLR", "name": null}}, "url": "https://github.com/virtualsatellite/VirtualSatellite4-Core/commit/7d8ddaea975dd8b69868f7087df7172301b47daf", "committedDate": "2020-12-05T09:29:58Z", "message": "Updating Naming for some Images - (Task #883)\n\n---\nTask #883: Adding George To Chapter State Machine Concept"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "d702f048118eec5215db0717ac7ffd6b5087576c", "author": {"user": {"login": "GeorgeNasrDLR", "name": null}}, "url": "https://github.com/virtualsatellite/VirtualSatellite4-Core/commit/d702f048118eec5215db0717ac7ffd6b5087576c", "committedDate": "2020-12-05T10:33:12Z", "message": "Another Update !! - (Task #883)\n\n---\nTask #883: Adding George To Chapter Concept State Machines"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "74fbb55e043556202cdae88d3fbcc93118a26d32", "author": {"user": {"login": "GeorgeNasrDLR", "name": null}}, "url": "https://github.com/virtualsatellite/VirtualSatellite4-Core/commit/74fbb55e043556202cdae88d3fbcc93118a26d32", "committedDate": "2020-12-05T19:28:49Z", "message": "Another trial (problem of Surfire) - (Task #883)\n\n---\nTask #883: Adding George To Chapter Concept State Machine"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NTQ2MTAyNTEz", "url": "https://github.com/virtualsatellite/VirtualSatellite4-Core/pull/878#pullrequestreview-546102513", "createdAt": "2020-12-07T12:30:01Z", "commit": {"oid": "74fbb55e043556202cdae88d3fbcc93118a26d32"}, "state": "APPROVED", "comments": {"totalCount": 0, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": null, "endCursor": null, "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": []}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 443, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-01T16:37:27Z"}}}
