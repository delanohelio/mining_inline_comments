Without the fix, these stale schemas will be\npackaged into the data template jar -> which is a problem.\nThe current workaround, which is implemented, is that we have a delete\ntask and a copy task. The delete task is triggered by a gradle project\nflag. The copy moves the files as intended. This workaround is not\nviable since it breaks the UP-TO-DATE checks between builds. In\nparticular, it breaks the UP-TO-DATE checks during a HOT RELOAD\n(runPlay task of the Play Framework).\nThe Fix:\nInstead of the workaround as above, we \"skip\" the delete task and make\nthe copy task become a sync task. The task name stays the same but the\nclass type will be a sync task which will \"Synchronizes the contents of\na destination directory with some source directories and files\n[https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.Sync.html]\".\nThis task will now delete stale files in the destination and will pass\nthe 'up-to-date' between builds.\nTesting:\nInteg test:\n\nValidate cacheability/up-to-date of tasks between builds when running the mainDataTemplateJar task.\nValidate the mainCopySchemas task will delete stale schemas (this is the issue that was specified above). This was tested using the mainDataTemplateJar task which has a dependency on the mainCopySchemas task.\n\nUnit test:\n\nValidate the mainCopySchemas task is a Sync task\n\nIn addition, I worked with @DPUkyle to create multiple configurations\nto allow the integ test to work.
