What problem does it solve? -->  Public methods should be showed in Java Docs and build method which was public was not shown.\nRoot Cause :-\nThe BaseBuilder is protected inner in Abstract parent class StsCredentialsProvider  which is of type @SdkInternalApi. Since BaseBuilder was protected all the concrete methods of StsCredentialsProvider didnot show in Java Docs\nSolution :-\nOverriden Build method as public in all the concrete methods where they just call super.buuild.\nAlternate Approaches\n\n\nMake BaseBuilder as Public from protected :- This approach is not feasible since BaseBuilder is inner class StsCredentialsProvider @SdkInternalApi. Now since BaseBuilder is in a class which is of @SdkInternalApi the java Docs Links are not functional so java doc no generated for BaseBuilder.\n\n\nMake BaseBuilder as separate independent Public Static class :- This would disrupt the structure in which the package is written where all the Builder are inner classes of the abstract classes. Also there are other two methods like stsClient and asyncCredentialUpdateEnabled which looks are protected builder methods for factory methods and not for external usage.\n\n\nTesting\nmvn install -P quick -T1C && mvn install javadoc:aggregate -B -Ppublic-javadoc -Dcheckstyle.skip -Dspotbugs.skip -DskipTests -Ddoclint=none -pl '!:protocol-tests,!:protocol-tests-core,!:codegen-generated-classes-test,!:sdk-benchmarks,!:module-path-tests,!:test-utils,!:http-client-tests,!:tests-coverage-reporting'\n\nbuild\npublic StsAssumeRoleCredentialsProvider build()\nBuild the credentials provider using the configuration applied to this builder.\n\nBug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\n\n New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\n\nChecklist\n\n I have read the CONTRIBUTING document\n Local run of mvn install succeeds\n My code follows the code style of this project\n My change requires a change to the Javadoc documentation\n I have updated the Javadoc documentation accordingly\n I have read the README document\n I have added tests to cover my changes\n All new and existing tests passed\n A short description of the change has been added to the CHANGELOG\n My change is to implement 1.11 parity feature and I have updated LaunchChangelog\n\nLicense\n\n\n\n\n I confirm that this pull request can be released under the Apache 2 license", "createdAt": "2020-09-03T08:51:20Z", "url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/pull/2018", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "5afcbd8849a315503f3f18b4c9a2ac0e1068081b"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-09-04T21:46:49Z", "author": {"login": "joviegas"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 3, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABdFUOhOgFqTQ4MjA2Mzg5Nw==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABdFsOpugH2gAyNDc4NDY5NzA5OmRiYzM3MTY4YTZjMDEwNDViNzU1NDgzYWJhNDU5ODdhMDM1YmNjYjA=", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDgyMDYzODk3", "url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/pull/2018#pullrequestreview-482063897", "createdAt": "2020-09-03T17:40:49Z", "commit": {"oid": "3f3e4a016222e5adba8d1747c715d58567d5e87d"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wOS0wM1QxNzo0MDo0OVrOHMxDaA==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wOS0wM1QxNzo0MDo0OVrOHMxDaA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4MzE0ODY0OA==", "bodyText": "@OverRide?
