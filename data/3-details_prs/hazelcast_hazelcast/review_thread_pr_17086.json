Specifically, the fields not listed in the insert statement will not retain their values, but\n+  will be assigned `null` or default values. If `INSERT OVERWRITE` is used for a target that doesn\u2019t overwrite by\n+  design (like Kafka), it will behave exactly as `INSERT INTO`. No error will be thrown. The delete in the imaginary\n+  `DELETE` action will delete no rows.\n+\n+### 1.1 Serialization\n+In addition to primitive SQL types (which can be mapped to Java types and stored directly), two serialization formats\n+are supported:\n+- POJO (reflective access to public properties and fields) - requires Java class on the classpath and no-arg\n+  constructor\n+- Portable (supported just for IMDG data structures) - if `InMemoryFormat` is set to `BINARY` it requires just\n+  `ClassDefinition` to be registered upfront, if `InMemoryFormat` is set to `OBJECT` it requires also Portable factory\n+  and Portable class itself on the classpath\n+\n+Serialization formats have following precedence (the order in which we check whether given serialization can be\n+applied):\n+1. primitive SQL types\n+2. POJO\n+3. Portable\n+\n+Eventual errors from type mismatch between declared and actual types are deferred to statement execution.\n+\n+The way the data is serialized is expressed via DDL. Depending on the nature of stored objects that information can be\n+encoded either in column names or using `OPTIONS` clause.\n+\n+#### 1.1.1 Key-Value storage\n+The serialization formats of key and value are specified separately. To determine whether given field belongs to key or\n+value either Java class or Portable `ClassDefinition` is inspected. In case of a name clash between fields of key and\n+value composite objects, the ones from key take precedence and are actually written.\n+\n+To define a table where both key and value are of primitive SQL types, `__key` & `this` as column names should be used.\n+For example:\n+```\n+CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE name (\n+  __key INT,\n+  this VARCHAR\n+) TYPE \"com.hazelcast.LocalPartitionedMap\"\n+```\n+\n+Given:\n+```\n+class PersonId {\n+    public int id;\n+}\n+\n+class Person {\n+    public String name;\n+}\n+```\n+To define a table where both key and value are POJOs and respectively of `PersonId` & `Person` class, `keyClass` &\n+`valueClass` should be used. For example:\n+```\n+CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE name (\n+  id INT,\n+  name VARCHAR\n+) TYPE \"com.hazelcast.LocalPartitionedMap\"\n+OPTIONS (keyClass 'PersonId', valueClass 'Person')\n+```\n+\n+Given:\n+```\n+ClassDefinition keyClassDefinition = new ClassDefinitionBuilder(1, 2, 3)\n+    .addIntField(\"id\")\n+    .build();\n+\n+ClassDefinition valueClassDefinition = new ClassDefinitionBuilder(4, 5, 6)\n+    .addUTFField(\"name\")\n+    .build();\n+```\n+To define a table where both key and value are Portables and map to respective `ClassDefinition`s, `keyFactoryId` +\n+`keyClassId` + `KeyClassVersion` & `valueFactoryId` + `valueClassId` + `valueClassVersion` should be used. For example:\n+```\n+CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE name (", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "3a4d9d0f7dc8a618d7a8cf43664da8392e3e06ec"}, "originalPosition": 88}]}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 584, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-12T20:28:25Z"}}}
