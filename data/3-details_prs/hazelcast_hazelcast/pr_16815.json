scalable data distribution platform.\n+----\n+\n+Hazelcast is an open-source distributed in-memory data store and\n+computation platform. It provides a wide variety of distributed data\n+structures and concurrency primitives, including:\n+\n+* A distributed, partitioned and queryable in-memory key-value store\n+  implementation, called `IMap`\n+* Additional data structures and simple messaging constructs such as\n+  `Set`, `MultiMap`, `Queue`, `Topic`\n+* A cluster-wide unique ID generator, called `FlakeIdGenerator`\n+* A distributed,\n+  [CRDT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type)\n+  based counter, called `PNCounter`\n+* A cardinality estimator based on [`HyperLogLog`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperLogLog)\n+\n+Additionally, Hazelcast includes a production-ready\n+[Raft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raft_(computer_science))\n+implementation which allows implementation of _linearizable_ constructs\n+such as:\n+\n+* A distributed and reentrant lock implementation, called `FencedLock`\n+* Primitives for distributed computing such as `AtomicLong`,\n+`AtomicReference` `CountDownLatch`\n+\n+Hazelcast data-structures are in-memory, highly optimized and offer very\n+low latencies. For a single `get` or `put` operation on a `IMap`, you\n+can typically expect a round-trip-time of under _100 microseconds_.\n+\n+It's very simple to form a cluster with Hazelcast, you can easily do it\n+on your computer by just starting several instances. The instances will\n+discover each other and form a cluster. There aren't any dependencies on\n+any external systems.\n+\n+Hazelcast automatically replicates data across the cluster and you are\n+able to seamlessly tolerate failures and add additional capacity to\n+the cluster when needed.\n+\n+Hazelcast comes with clients in the following programming languages:\n+\n+* [Java](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast)\n+* [.NET](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-csharp-client)\n+* [Python](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-python-client)\n+* [C++](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-cpp-client)\n+* [Node.js](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-nodejs-client)\n+* [Go](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-go-client)\n+\n+Hazelcast also has first-class support for running on different\n+cloud providers such as [AWS](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-aws), \n+[GCP](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-gcp) \n+and [Azure](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-azure)\n+as well as on [Kubernetes](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-kubernetes).\n+\n+## Download\n+\n+You can download Hazelcast from\n+[www.hazelcast.org](http://hazelcast.org/download/). Once you have\n+downloaded, you can start the Hazelcast instance using the script\n+`bin/start.sh`. \n+\n+## Get Started\n+\n+Hazelcast allows you to interact with a cluster using a simple \n+API, for example you can use the Hazelcast Java Client to connect\n+to a running cluster and perform operations on it:\n+\n+```java\n+HazelcastInstance hz = HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient();\n+IMap<String, String> map = hz.getMap(\"my-distributed-map\");\n+map.put(\"key\", \"value\");\n+String current = map.get(\"key\");\n+map.putIfAbsent(\"somekey\", \"somevalue\");\n+map.replace(\"key\", \"value\", \"newvalue\");\n+```\n \n-With its various distributed data structures, distributed caching capabilities, elastic nature, memcache support,\n-integration with Spring and Hibernate and more importantly with so many happy users, Hazelcast is feature-rich,\n-enterprise-ready and developer-friendly in-memory data grid solution.\n+You only need to add a single JAR as a dependency:\n \n-### Features:\n+````xml\n+<dependency>\n+    <groupId>com.hazelcast</groupId>\n+    <artifactId>hazelcast</artifactId>\n+    <version>${hazelcast.version}</version>\n+</dependency>\n+````\n \n-* Distributed implementations of `java.util.{Queue, Set, List, Map}`.\n-* Distributed implementation of `java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock`.\n-* Distributed implementation of `java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService`.\n-* Distributed `MultiMap` for one-to-many relationships.\n-* Distributed `Topic` for publish/subscribe messaging.\n-* Distributed Query and Aggregators.\n-* Synchronous (write-through) and asynchronous (write-behind) persistence.\n-* Transaction support.\n-* Specification compliant JCache implementation.\n-* Native Java, .NET, C++ clients, Memcache and REST clients.\n-* Socket level encryption support for secure clusters.\n-* Second level cache provider for Hibernate.\n-* Monitoring and management of the cluster via JMX.\n-* Dynamic HTTP session clustering.\n-* Support for cluster info and membership events.\n-* Dynamic discovery, scaling, partitioning with backups and fail-over.\n+For more information, see the [Getting Started Guide](https://hazelcast.org/imdg/get-started/)\n \n-### Getting Started\n+## Documentation\n \n-See [Getting Started Guide](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#getting-started)\n+See the [reference\n+manual](https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html)\n+for in-depth documentation about Hazelcast features.\n \n-### Documentation\n+## Code Samples\n \n-See documentation at [www.hazelcast.org](http://hazelcast.org/documentation/)\n+See [Hazelcast Code Samples](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-code-samples)\n \n-### Code Samples\n+## Hazelcast Jet\n \n-See [Hazelcast Code Samples](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-code-samples)\n+[Hazelcast Jet](https://jet-start.sh) is a distributed batch and stream\n+processing framework based on Hazelcast.
