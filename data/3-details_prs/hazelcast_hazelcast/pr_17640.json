For\n+instance, `a + b` is syntactically valid and `a +` is invalid.\n+\n+In Calcite, AST nodes are represented as subclasses of `SqlNode`. Column\n+and type references are represented by `SqlIdentifier`. Literals are\n+represented by `SqlLiteral` and its subclasses. Parameters are\n+represented by `SqlDynamicParam`. Most other, if not all, expressions\n+are subclasses of `SqlCall`.\n+\n+### Validation Stage\n+\n+The goal of the validation stage is to make sure that the AST\n+expressions produced by the previous parsing stage are semantically\n+valid. For instance, `1 + 1` is semantically valid while `1 + true` is\n+not.\n+\n+In Calcite, the validation logic is encapsulated and orchestrated by\n+implementations of `SqlValidator`. Specifically, `SqlValidatorImpl`\n+extended by `HazelcastSqlValidator` is used to customize the validation\n+logic to align it with our requirements.\n+\n+As a first step of the validation process, `SqlValidatorImpl` may apply\n+some transformations to the passed AST which should not affect the\n+semantics of the AST. Such transformations are called \"unconditional\n+rewrites\" (see `SqlValidatorImpl.performUnconditionalRewrites`). Every\n+`SqlCall` node has an associated `SqlOperator` returned by its\n+`getOperator` method. `SqlOperator` implementations may customize\n+various aspects of a certain operator including the rewriting behavior\n+itself (see `SqlOperator.rewriteCall`).\n+\n+Normally, Calcite's parser inspects the hardcoded `SqlStdOperatorTable`\n+implementation of `SqlOperatorTable` to resolve a certain operator, so\n+it's hard to customize the pre-existing operators. To make the\n+customization possible, operators from `SqlStdOperatorTable` are patched\n+to the ones from `HazelcastSqlOperatorTable` during the AST rewriting\n+process (see `HazelcastSqlValidator.performUnconditionalRewrites` and\n+`HazelcastOperatorTableVisitor`).\n+\n+Usually, semantic validation requires assigning types to every\n+expression and its operand expressions, if any. In Calcite, that type\n+assignment behavior may be customized in several ways:\n+\n+- `SqlValidator.deriveType` may customize the behavior globally.\n+\n+- Each `SqlOperator` implementation may customize its operand type\n+  inference strategy (see `SqlOperandTypeInference` and\n+  `SqlOperator.getOperandTypeInference`) and its return type inference\n+  strategy (see `SqlReturnTypeInference`,\n+  `SqlOperator.getReturnTypeInference` and\n+  `SqlOperator.inferReturnType`). The first one is used only if some of\n+  the operand types are unknown. Also, operand type validation strategy\n+  can be customized using an associated `SqlOperandTypeChecker` (see\n+  `SqlOperator.getOperandTypeChecker`).\n+\n+- Additionally, some expressions require their operands to be coerced to\n+  a certain type. For instance, `=` operator requires both of its sides\n+  to be of the same type. In Calcite, such coercion services are\n+  provided by `TypeCoercion` implementations. Specifically,\n+  `TypeCoercionImpl` extended by `HazelcastTypeCoercion` is used to\n+  customize the coercion logic.\n+\n+The following general rules apply when assigning types:\n+\n+- Literals: `TRUE` and `FALSE` literals receive `BOOLEAN` type; numeric\n+  literals containing no decimal point (`1`, `42`, etc.) receive the\n+  smallest integer type possible (`TINYINT`, `SMALLINT`, `INTEGER` or\n+  `BIGINT`); numeric literals containing decimal point (`1.1`, `4.2`,\n+  etc.) receive `DECIMAL` type; scientific notation numeric literals\n+  (`1e1`, `4.2e2`, etc.) receive `DOUBLE` type; string literals\n+  (`'foo'`) receive `VARCHAR` type.\n+\n+- Parameters: parameter types are inferred from the context: `1.0 + ?`,\n+  the parameter would receive `DOUBLE` type.\n+\n+As an end result, for semantically valid ASTs, the validation process\n+produces a potentially transformed AST where every node has a known\n+type. For semantically invalid ASTs, an error is reported.\n+\n+### Conversion Stage\n+\n+The goal of the conversion stage it to convert the syntactically and\n+semantically valid AST (`SqlNode`) received from the previous stages to\n+a representation suitable for the relational optimization. In Calcite,\n+relational nodes are represented by subclasses of `RelNode` while\n+expression nodes referenced from relational ones are represented by\n+subclasses of `RexNode`.\n+\n+During conversion Calcite also applies various simplifications and\n+optimizations to expressions (see `SqlToRelConverter` and\n+`HazelcastSqlToRelConverter`).

Specifically, `SqlValidatorImpl`\n+extended by `HazelcastSqlValidator` is used to customize the validation\n+logic to align it with our requirements: the narrowest integer type is\n+assigned to integer literals and to `CAST` operators involving integer\n+types.\n+\n+As a first step of the validation process, `SqlValidatorImpl` may apply\n+some transformations to the passed AST which should not affect the\n+semantics of the AST. Such transformations are called \"unconditional\n+rewrites\" (see `SqlValidatorImpl.performUnconditionalRewrites`). Every\n+`SqlCall` node has an associated `SqlOperator` returned by its\n+`getOperator` method. `SqlOperator` implementations may customize\n+various aspects of a certain operator including the rewriting behavior\n+itself (see `SqlOperator.rewriteCall`).\n+\n+Normally, Calcite's parser inspects the hardcoded `SqlStdOperatorTable`\n+implementation of `SqlOperatorTable` to resolve a certain operator, so\n+it's hard to customize the pre-existing operators. To make the\n+customization possible, operators from `SqlStdOperatorTable` are patched\n+to the ones from `HazelcastSqlOperatorTable` during the AST rewriting\n+process (see `HazelcastSqlValidator.performUnconditionalRewrites` and\n+`HazelcastOperatorTableVisitor`).\n+\n+Usually, semantic validation requires assigning types to every\n+expression and its operand expressions, if any. In Calcite, that type\n+assignment behavior may be customized in several ways:\n+\n+- `SqlValidator.deriveType` may customize the behavior globally, it's\n+  the main source of truth for node types and invoked every time when a\n+  node type is needed. Derived types are cached by the validator to\n+  avoid constant re-derivation. Usually, if a node in question is an\n+  operator the validator just delegates the type derivation to it using\n+  `SqlOperator.deriveType`. Which in turn, usually, delegates back to\n+  the validator to derive the types of its operands and then calls\n+  `SqlOperator.inferReturnType`, which may delegate to\n+  `SqlReturnTypeInference` strategy associated with the operator.\n+\n+- Each `SqlOperator` implementation may customize its operand type\n+  inference strategy (see `SqlOperandTypeInference` and\n+  `SqlOperator.getOperandTypeInference`) and its return type inference\n+  strategy (see `SqlReturnTypeInference`,\n+  `SqlOperator.getReturnTypeInference` and\n+  `SqlOperator.inferReturnType`). Also, operand type validation strategy\n+  can be customized using an associated `SqlOperandTypeChecker` (see\n+  `SqlOperator.getOperandTypeChecker`).\n+\n+- Additionally, some expressions require their operands to be coerced to\n+  a certain type. For instance, `=` operator requires both of its sides\n+  to be of the same type. In Calcite, such coercion services are\n+  provided by `TypeCoercion` implementations. Specifically,\n+  `TypeCoercionImpl` extended by `HazelcastTypeCoercion` is used to\n+  customize the coercion logic.\n+\n+The following general rules apply when assigning types:\n+\n+- Literals: `TRUE` and `FALSE` literals receive `BOOLEAN` type; numeric\n+  literals containing no decimal point (`1`, `42`, etc.) receive the\n+  narrowest integer type possible (`TINYINT`, `SMALLINT`, `INTEGER` or\n+  `BIGINT`); numeric literals containing decimal point (`1.1`, `4.2`,\n+  etc.) receive `DECIMAL` type; scientific notation numeric literals\n+  (`1e1`, `4.2e2`, etc.) receive `DOUBLE` type; string literals\n+  (`'foo'`) receive `VARCHAR` type.\n+\n+- Parameters: parameter types are inferred from the context: `1.0 + ?`,\n+  the parameter would receive `DECIMAL` type since the type of the\n+  left-hand side literal is `DECIMAL`; `1 + ?`, despite the fact that\n+  the literal type is `TINYINT` the parameter would receive `BIGINT`\n+  type because `TINYINT` is too restrictive; `sin(?)`, the parameter\n+  would receive `DOUBLE` type since it's the only type accepted by `sin`\n+  function. In certain cases (`SELECT ?`, for instance) it's impossible\n+  to infer a concrete type, more on that below.\n+  \n+In general, the validation process begins with a call to\n+`SqlValidator.validate`, which starts a recursive validation of the\n+passed node and its children. Typically, during the validation, types\n+should be _derived_ for every node starting at the root, that usually\n+requires knowing types of all child nodes. Types of certain nodes\n+(dynamic parameters, for instance) might be unknown, so as a first step\n+every node tries to _infer_ types for its child nodes of unknown types.\n+For operators this process can be customized using\n+`SqlOperandTypeInference` strategy associated with an operator.\n+\n+If a node type can't be inferred, the validation fails. Currently, that\n+happens if an operator acts only on dynamic parameters and/or `NULL`s.\n+This might change in the future, for instance we may assign some default\n+type in such cases. Consider `? + ?`, `+` operator can be applied to\n+numeric and temporal types, we may choose to assign `DECIMAL` type for\n+the parameters in this specific case. Alternatively, we might take into\n+account the actual types of the passed parameter arguments and construct\n+separate query plans based on that information, that way we would not\n+need any one-size-fits-all defaults. `NULL` as a type is not a\n+first-class citizen in Calcite: basically, every `NULL` literal\n+participating in some operator or function must have a concrete type\n+assigned, therefore `NULL + NULL` is affected by the same type inference\n+problem, which might be solved by making `NULL` type a first-class\n+citizen or by choosing some defaults.\n+\n+After all unknown types are inferred and assigned to nodes, type for\n+every tree node can be derived from the node itself potentially\n+consulting its child nodes for their types. Most operators have an\n+additional round of type refinement called type coercion. For instance,\n+both sides of the binary comparison operators are coerced to the same\n+type respecting type precedence and conversion rules defined in [Type\n+System design document](01-type-system.md). Another example is the\n+binary arithmetic operators coercing their operands to a common type.\n+The coercion can be customized by providing a custom `TypeCoercion` (see", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "6f9f770951ae82a989f8f59474cfcac890f03956"}, "originalPosition": 154}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "2311497e69a49d9d38938c7b67de723ef9cbceaf", "author": {"user": {"login": "taburet", "name": "Sergey Sitnikov"}}, "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/commit/2311497e69a49d9d38938c7b67de723ef9cbceaf", "committedDate": "2020-10-02T12:50:56Z", "message": "address review comments"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NTAxMTU3MTgy", "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/17640#pullrequestreview-501157182", "createdAt": "2020-10-02T13:55:42Z", "commit": {"oid": "2311497e69a49d9d38938c7b67de723ef9cbceaf"}, "state": "APPROVED", "comments": {"totalCount": 0, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": null, "endCursor": null, "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": []}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "70a7ddd2f431559ca57355b421199079c02ea5e3", "author": {"user": {"login": "taburet", "name": "Sergey Sitnikov"}}, "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/commit/70a7ddd2f431559ca57355b421199079c02ea5e3", "committedDate": "2020-10-07T05:23:53Z", "message": "Merge branch 'master' into expressions-tdd"}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 3179, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-01T14:51:55Z"}}}
