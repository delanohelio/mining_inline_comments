This is what the default test does, but then, it takes hours.

We shouldn't advertise to skip the tests right away. We kind of know that nobody will ever run it, but let's not advertise and let them skip it themselves.

Thing is, since I've joined, there were already more than 20k tests in the QuickTest category so it would first take an effort to identify the basic ones which are worth their own category to run locally.\nSecondly, the PR builder always took about 30-40 minutes so most of the time, it was simpler for everyone involved to simply push the commit and get feedback from all 20k - 30k tests. Running fewer tests (e.g. 1k) might feel good (as if nothing has been broken) but I'm not sure what kind of coverage we would have with that set of tests, and again the full suite would be run as soon as the commit was pushed, which would uncover many more issues.\nAlso, a lot of the times community PRs fail on checkstyle and findbugs. We say users should run them, but they don't. So really, I don't expect users to run even 1k tests locally :)\nFinally, I do see some room for improvement. I don't believe we actually need about 30k tests that we have now and I'm sure there is lots of duplication. What would be great if we could clean up the test codebase to decrease the number of tests, decrease the PR builder time and maybe even make it possible to run some sensible set of tests locally.
