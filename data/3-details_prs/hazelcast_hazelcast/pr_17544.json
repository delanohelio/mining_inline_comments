Please share with us the following information, to help us resolve your issue quickly and efficiently.\n-1.\tHazelcast version that you use (e.g. 4.0.1, also specify whether it is a minor release or the latest snapshot).\n-2.\tCluster size, i.e. the number of Hazelcast cluster members.\n-3.\tNumber of the clients.\n-4.\tVersion of Java. It is also helpful to mention the JVM parameters.\n-5.\tOperating system.
