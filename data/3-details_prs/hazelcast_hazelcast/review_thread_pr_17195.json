The numbers in the square brackets refer to the issues in Hazelcast's GitHub repositories.\n-\n-==== 3.12.7 ====\n-\n-1. Enhancements\n-\n-* Added a public API to load configuration files: the new `load()` method in `Config`,\n-`ClientConfig`, and `ClientFailoverConfig` loads the configurations with\n-given locations. If not found, the default configuration is returned. [#16864]\n-* Updated the version of Hazelcast Kubernetes discovery plugin to 1.5.3. [#16589]\n-* Added the support for automatically detecting the classloader of a type for\n-the user code deployment feature. [#16421]\n-\n-2. Fixes\n-\n-* Fixed an issue where Map, Cache, MultiMap data structures\n-were returning negative values (`size()`) when the size is more than\n-`Integer.MAX_VALUE`. [#16897]\n-* Fixed an issue where explicitly registering portable class definitions\n-was failing with multiple portable factories and overlapping class IDs. [#16832]\n-* Fixed an issue where Reliable Topic was not working properly due to\n-missing permissions. [#16773]\n-* Fixed an issue where the wait key of a blocking call within a Raft\n-invocation was still being reported as a live operation, when the key times out. [#16616]\n-* Fixed an issue where the upload of classes using the client user code\n-deployment were not successful when they are retrieved not in their created order. [#16610]\n-* Fixed an issue where `InPredicate` was not invoking value comparison when the\n-read attribute is null. [#16578]\n-* Fixed an invalidation issue when using a transactional map from a cache\n-with Near Cache: the cache invalidation event occurs when the\n-`transactionalMap.put` method is called. As a result, the entry was getting\n-invalidated before the change is committed to the map. [#16577]\n-\n-==== 3.12.6 ====\n-\n-1. New Features\n-\n-* Introduced Bitmap Indexes to significantly lower\n-index memory usage for low-cardinality columns and also to speed up\n-the queries and lower memory requirements for them\n-when the queries have multiple predicates acting on the same bitmap index.\n-Note that bitmap indexes usage, currently, is a good fit for\n-array/collection attribute indexing, rather than regular\n-single-valued attributes. See the Bitmap Indexes section.\n-\n-2. Enhancements\n-\n-* Added support for AWS PrivateLink: Now, Hazelcast IMDG Java\n-client can work with Hazelcast Cloud when it uses AWS PrivateLink.\n-\n-3. Fixes\n-\n-* Fixed the map configuration so that now the value of\n-`optimize-queries` element is not serialized anymore. [#16524]\n-* Fixed an issue where disabling the quorum had not an effect\n-and was still checking the presence of split-brain protection. [#16507]\n-* Fixed an issue where the `Imap.containsKey()` method was not\n-able to find Near Cached entries when it is called from a\n-client. [#16472]\n-* Fixed a race condition caused by using on-heap indexes\n-while indexing is in progress. [#16461]\n-* Fixed the issue with `setInstanceName()` when using Spring Boot\n-and Hazelcast client: the `getOrCreate()` method\n-has been added to the client configuration. [#16363]\n-* Fixed an issue where wildcard usage at\n-`CLASSPATH` was breaking the `stop.bat` and\n-`start.bat` scripts. [#16355]\n-* Fixed an issue where the migration operations were running\n-before the previous finalization is completed. [#16190]\n-* Fixed an issue where repetitive calls of `IMap.loadAll()`\n-may cause memory leaks. [#16172]\n-* Fixed the joining mechanism so that when the discovery\n-strategy is enabled, multiple join configurations are prevented. [#16143]\n-* Fixed an issue where a client in the `CLIENT_DISCONNECTED`\n-status was never receiving the changes in the cluster member attributes. [#15623]\n-* Fixed an issue where the `MembershipListener.memberAdded()`\n-method after a split-brain merge was showing a different\n-member order. [#15353]\n-\n-==== 3.12.5 ====\n-\n-1. Enhancements\n-\n-* Added option to disable retrieving the\n-`OSMBean.getFreePhysicalMemorySize()` method. [#16065]\n-* The `recreateCachesOnCluster` invocation is not being checked\n-for the maximum invocations count anymore during cluster restarts. [#16014]\n-\n-2. Fixes\n-\n-* Fixed an issue where repetitive calls of `IMap.loadAll()`\n-may cause memory leaks. [#16171]\n-* Fixed an issue where an HTTP request via\n-`hazelcast/rest/cluster` was failing when using the advanced network\n-configuration and a client endpoint is\n-not specified. In this case, this request's response\n-has been improved to report `0` as the client connection count. [#16150]\n-* Fixed an issue where an enabled `redoOperation()` was not\n-throwing an exception when an empty list is tried to be retrieved\n-on the client. [#16019]\n-* Fixed an issue where gathering MultiMap statistics was breaking\n-the split-brain healing with `LatestAccessMergePolicy`. [#16003]\n-* Fixed the `multiplier` element of client's connection\n-retry configuration to be set as a `double` in the\n-XML configuration (`hazelcast-client.xml). [#15990]\n-* Fixed the following Hot Restart issues:\n-   ** Introduced an additional stage to the Hot Restart\n-procedure, i.e., `HotRestartIntegrationService.startup()`,\n-which waits until all members transition from the `PASSIVE` state.\n-This guarantees all members to have the same state after Hot\n-Restart operation is finished.\n-   ** IMap proxies created during Hot Restart are not initialized\n-and published to other cluster members. So the operation\n-has been improved to force initialize any uninitialized proxies\n-and publish them. This fixed the issue where the\n-`getDistributedObjects()` method was not reporting the persisted\n-objects after a Hot Restart.\n-[#15986]\n-* Fixed an issue where, after forming a cluster, certain members\n-occasionally do not contain `EventService` registrations for\n-some other members. [#15950]\n-* Fixed an issue where calling the `IMap.removeAll()` method\n-without index was updating the last access and expiry time\n-for all records. [#15853]\n-* Fixed an issue where the client connection count\n-was retrieved using an incorrect method. [#15681]\n-\n-==== 3.12.4 ====\n-\n-1. Enhancements\n-\n-- Added support for the `PartitionLostListener` configuration\n-on the client side. [#15762]\n-\n-2. Fixes\n-\n-- Fixed an issue where the query was ignoring the index\n-but was processing successfully. [#15808]\n-- Fixed an issue where the predicate queries to retrieve\n-multi-values were failing on the nested JSON objects in arrays. [#15789]\n-- Fixed a possible livelock when many threads were trying to\n-use the `incrementMod()` method causing an infinite loop. [#15777]\n-- Fixed shutting down Management Center service caused by\n-an NPE when MultiMap statistics are gathered after\n-`MultiMapService.shutdown()`.
