Set up your [Java Developer Environment](https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup).\n-1. Fork the repo.\n-1. Develop and test your code.\n-1. Ensure that your code adheres to the [SAMPLE_FORMAT.md](SAMPLE_FORMAT.md)\n-guidelines.\n-1. Ensure that your code has an appropriate set of unit tests which all pass.\n-1. Submit a pull request.\n-1. A maintainer will review the pull request and make comments.\n-\n-## Build Tools\n-\n-All new samples should build and run integration tests with both [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/).\n-\n-## Integration Testing\n-\n-All samples must have integration tests that run with Maven and Gradle\n-\n-* Test Library: [JUnit4](https://junit.org/junit4/)\n-* Test Runner: [Maven Failsafe plugin](https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-failsafe-plugin/) and [Maven Surefire plugin](https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/).\n-\n-### Running Tests Locally\n-\n-Run tests locally with commands:\n-\n-* Maven: `mvn verify`\n-* Gradle: `gradle build test`\n-\n-### Gradle Specifcs\n-Your `build.gradle` should have the following section:\n-\n-```groovy\n-\n-test {\n-  useJUnit()\n-  testLogging.showStandardStreams = true\n-  beforeTest { descriptor ->\n-     logger.lifecycle(\"test: \" + descriptor + \"  Running\")\n-  }\n-\n-  onOutput { descriptor, event ->\n-     logger.lifecycle(\"test: \" + descriptor + \": \" + event.message )\n-  }\n-  afterTest { descriptor, result ->\n-    logger.lifecycle(\"test: \" + descriptor + \": \" + result )\n-  }\n-}\n-```\n-\n-### Other Testing Set Up\n-\n-Most samples require a GCP project and billing account. Keep the following in\n-mind when setting up tests.\n-\n-* **Environment variables**  \n-  Minimize additional environment variables that need to be set to run the tests.\n-  If you do require additional environment variables, they should be added to\n-  `run_tests.sh`.\n-\n-  Existing environment variables include:\n-  * `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`\n-  * `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`\n-  * `PROJECT_ID`\n-\n-* **API library**  \n-  If an API needs to be enabled in the testing project, add this information to the\n-  directory's CONTRIBUTING.md file. If there is no CONTRIBUTING.md file, add one in your PR.\n-\n-* **Cloud resources**  \n-  Most Java samples create the Cloud resources that they need to run. If this\n-  is resource intensive or not possible, add instructions to the directory's CONTRIBUTING.md file\n-  to add the resource to the testing project.\n-\n-* **Keys and Secrets**\n-  Add a note in the pull request, in order for a Java maintainer to assist you\n-  in adding keys and secrets to the testing project.\n+You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one\n+(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it\n+again.\n \n ## Style\n \n-Samples in this repository follow the [Google Java Style Guide][java-style].\n-This is enforced using the [Maven Checkstyle Plugin][checkstyle-plugin].\n-\n-[java-style]: https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html\n-[checkstyle-plugin]: https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-checkstyle-plugin/\n-\n-Use the [google-java-format][google-java-format] tool to automatically reformat\n-your source code to adhere to the style guide. It is available as a command-line\n-tool or IntelliJ plugin.\n-\n-[google-java-format]: https://github.com/google/google-java-format\n-\n-### Adding the Checkstyle Plugin to New Samples\n-\n-The samples in this repository use a common parent POM to define plugins used\n-for linting and testing. Add the following to your sample POM to ensure that it\n-uses the common Checkstyle configuration. For more information, see the\n-[java-repo-tools](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/java-repo-tools)\n-repository.\n-\n-```xml\n-<!--\n-    The parent pom defines common style checks and testing strategies for our samples.\n-    Removing or replacing it should not affect the execution of the samples in anyway.\n-  -->\n-<parent>\n-  <groupId>com.google.cloud</groupId>\n-  <artifactId>doc-samples</artifactId>\n-  <version>1.0.11</version>\n-</parent>\n-```\n-\n-### Running the Linter\n-\n-To run the checkstyle & ErrorProne plugins on an existing sample, run\n+All code should follow the [Sample Format Guidelines](blob/master/SAMPLE_FORMAT.md)\n \n-```shell\n-mvn clean verify -DskipTests\n-```\n+## Code reviews\n \n-The `-DskipTests` is optional.
