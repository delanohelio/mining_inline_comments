Snapshots are\n+identified by BIGINT snapshot ids.  You can find the latest snapshot id for table\n+foo by running the following command::\n+\n+    SELECT snapshot_id FROM 'foo$snapshots' ORDER BY committed_at DESC LIMIT 1\n+\n+A SQL procedure ``system.rollback_to_snapshot`` allows the caller to roll back\n+the state of the table to a previous snapshot id::\n+\n+    CALL system.rollback_to_snapshot(schema_name, table_name, snapshot_id)\n+\n+Schema Evolution\n+----------------\n+\n+Iceberg and the Iceberg connector support schema evolution, with safe\n+column add, drop, reorder and rename operations, including in nested structures.\n+Table partitioning can also be changed and the connector can still\n+query data created before the partitioning change.\n+\n+Migrating Existing Tables\n+-------------------------\n+\n+The connector can read from or write to Hive tables that have been migrated to Iceberg.\n+Currently, there is no Presto support to migrate Hive tables to Presto, so you will\n+need to use either the Iceberg API or Spark.\n+\n+System Tables and Columns\n+-------------------------\n+\n+The connector supports ``table$partitions`` as a substitute for Hive's ``SHOW PARTITIONS``.\n+The differences are that it returns some partition metrics for each partition value\n+and you can also use it on unpartitioned tables.\n+\n+Iceberg supports ``$snapshot_id`` and ``$snapshot_timestamp_ms`` as hidden columns.\n+These columns allow users to query an old version of the table.

Snapshots are\n+identified by BIGINT snapshot ids.  You can find the latest snapshot id for table\n+foo by running the following command::\n+\n+    SELECT snapshot_id FROM 'foo$snapshots' ORDER BY committed_at DESC LIMIT 1\n+\n+A SQL procedure ``system.rollback_to_snapshot`` allows the caller to roll back\n+the state of the table to a previous snapshot id::\n+\n+    CALL system.rollback_to_snapshot(schema_name, table_name, snapshot_id)\n+\n+Schema Evolution\n+----------------\n+\n+Iceberg and the Iceberg connector support schema evolution, with safe\n+column add, drop, reorder and rename operations, including in nested structures.\n+Table partitioning can also be changed and the connector can still\n+query data created before the partitioning change.\n+\n+Migrating Existing Tables\n+-------------------------\n+\n+The connector can read from or write to Hive tables that have been migrated to Iceberg.\n+Currently, there is no Presto support to migrate Hive tables to Presto, so you will\n+need to use either the Iceberg API or Spark.\n+\n+System Tables and Columns\n+-------------------------\n+\n+The connector supports ``table$partitions`` as a substitute for Hive's ``SHOW PARTITIONS``.\n+The differences are that it returns some partition metrics for each partition value\n+and you can also use it on unpartitioned tables.\n+\n+Iceberg supports ``$snapshot_id`` and ``$snapshot_timestamp_ms`` as hidden columns.\n+These columns allow users to query an old version of the table. Think of this\n+as a time-travel feature which lets you query your table's snapshot at a given time.\n+\n+Iceberg Table Properties\n+------------------------\n+\n+================================================== ============================================================ ============\n+Property Name                                      Description                                                  Default\n+================================================== ============================================================ ============\n+``format``                                         Optionally specifies the format of table data files;         ORC\n+                                                   either PARQUET or ORC.\n+\n+``partitioning``                                   Optionally specifies table partitioning.\n+                                                   If a table is partitioned by columns c1 and c2, the\n+                                                   partitioning property would be\n+                                                   ``partitioning = ARRAY['c1', 'c2']``\n+\n+``location``                                       Optionally specifies the file system location URI for\n+                                                   the table\n+================================================== ============================================================ ============\n+\n+The table definition below specifies format PARQUET, partitioning by columns c1 and c2,", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4MzMyNTMxNw=="}, "originalCommit": null, "originalPosition": 187}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMzAyMjAyNjc5OnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "presto-docs/src/main/sphinx/connector/iceberg.rst", "isResolved": false, "comments": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wOS0wNFQwMDo1NjoxNlrOHM8AoQ==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wOS0wNFQxNDo1MTo0M1rOHNQruQ==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4MzMyODE2MQ==", "bodyText": "This actually supports more than just characters: https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/#truncate-transform-details", "url": "https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/4537#discussion_r483328161", "createdAt": "2020-09-04T00:56:16Z", "author": {"login": "electrum"}, "path": "presto-docs/src/main/sphinx/connector/iceberg.rst", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,197 @@\n+=================\n+Iceberg Connector\n+=================\n+\n+Overview\n+--------\n+\n+Apache Iceberg is an open table format for huge analytic datasets.\n+The Iceberg connector allows querying data stored in\n+files written in Iceberg format, as defined in the\n+`Iceberg Table Spec <https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/>`_.\n+\n+The Iceberg connector supports:\n+\n+* All Presto types, including TIME, TIMESTAMP, DECIMAL\n+* CREATE TABLE and CREATE TABLE AS\n+* Partitioning tables by any Presto type\n+* Dropping tables\n+* Renaming tables\n+* Deletion by partition\n+* Table and column statistics\n+* Table and column comments\n+* Rolling back a table to a previous state\n+* Schema evolution\n+\n+The Iceberg table state is maintained in metadata files.
