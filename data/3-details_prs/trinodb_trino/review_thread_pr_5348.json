improve the performance of queries\n+with selective joins by avoiding unnecessary processing of data from the probe side\n+which does not match the join criteria.\n+Consider the following query which captures a common pattern of a fact table ``store_sales``\n+joined with a filtered dimension table ``date_dim``:\n+\n+    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM\n+    store_sales JOIN date_dim ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk\n+    WHERE d_following_holiday='Y' AND d_year = 2000;\n+\n+Without dynamic filtering, Presto will push predicates for the dimension table to the\n+table scan on ``date_dim`` but it will scan all the data in the fact table since there\n+are no filters on ``store_sales`` in the query. The join operator will end up throwing away\n+most of the probe-side rows as the join criteria is highly selective.\n+\n+For dynamic filtering, Presto collects values eligible for the join from the\n+build side tasks in worker nodes. In the case of broadcast joins, the runtime predicates\n+generated from this collection are pushed into the table scan on the connected data source\n+running locally on the same worker. Additionally, these runtime predicates are communicated\n+to the coordinator over the network so that dynamic filtering can also be performed\n+on the coordinator during enumeration of splits for a table scan by a connector.\n+For example, in the case of Hive connector, dynamic filters are used to skip loading\n+partitions which don't match the join criteria, this is known as dynamic partition pruning.\n+\n+The results of dynamic filtering optimization can include the following benefits:\n+\n+* improved overall query performance\n+* reduced network traffic between Presto and the data source\n+* reduced load on the remote data source\n+\n+Support for dynamic filtering is specific to each connector and the relevant underlying\n+database or storage system.\n+\n+Analysis and Confirmation\n+-------------------------\n+\n+Dynamic filtering depends on a number of factors:\n+\n+* Planner support for dynamic filtering for a given join operation in Presto.\n+  Currently inner joins with equality join condition and semi-joins with IN conditions are supported.\n+* Connector support for utilizing dynamic filters pushed into table scan at runtime.\n+  For example, Hive connector can push dynamic filters into ORC and Parquet readers\n+  to perform stripe or row-group pruning.\n+* Connector support for utilizing dynamic filters at the splits enumeration stage.\n+* Connector support for delaying scheduling of probe side until dynamic filters are ready.\n+* Size of build side of join.\n+\n+To analyze if the planner is adding dynamic filters to a specific query's plan,\n+take a closer look at the :doc:`EXPLAIN plan </sql/explain>` of the query.\n+For example, the explain plan for the above query can be obtained by running::\n+\n+    EXPLAIN\n+    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM\n+    store_sales JOIN date_dim ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk\n+    WHERE d_following_holiday='Y' AND d_year = 2000;\n+\n+The explain plan for this query shows ``dynamicFilterAssignments`` in the\n+``InnerJoin`` node with dynamic filter ``df_370`` collected from build symbol ``d_date_sk``.\n+You can also see the ``dynamicFilter`` predicate as part of the Hive ``ScanFilterProject``\n+operator where ``df_370`` is associated with probe symbol ``ss_sold_date_sk``.\n+This shows you that the planner was successful in pushing dynamic filters\n+down to the connector in the query plan .\n+\n+.. code-block:: none\n+\n+    Fragment 0 [SINGLE]\n+        Output layout: [count]\n+        Output partitioning: SINGLE []\n+        Stage Execution Strategy: UNGROUPED_EXECUTION\n+        Output[_col0]\n+        \u2502   Layout: [count:bigint]\n+        \u2502   Estimates: {rows: ?

The join operator will end up throwing away\n+most of the probe-side rows as the join criteria is highly selective.\n+\n+When dynamic filtering is enabled, Presto will collect candidate values for join condition\n+from the processed dimension table on the right side of join. In the case of broadcast joins,\n+the runtime predicates generated from this collection are pushed into the local table scan\n+on the left side of join running on the same worker.\n+Additionally, these runtime predicates are communicated to the coordinator over the network\n+so that dynamic filtering can also be performed on the coordinator during enumeration of\n+table scan splits. For example, in the case of Hive connector, dynamic filters are used\n+to skip loading of partitions which don't match the join criteria.\n+This is known as dynamic partition pruning.\n+\n+The results of dynamic filtering optimization can include the following benefits:\n+\n+* improved overall query performance\n+* reduced network traffic between Presto and the data source\n+* reduced load on the remote data source\n+\n+Support for push down of dynamic filters is specific to each connector\n+and the relevant underlying database or storage system.\n+\n+Analysis and Confirmation\n+-------------------------\n+\n+Dynamic filtering depends on a number of factors:\n+\n+* Planner support for dynamic filtering for a given join operation in Presto.\n+  Currently inner joins with equality join condition and semi-joins with IN conditions are supported.\n+* Connector support for utilizing dynamic filters pushed into table scan at runtime.\n+  For example, Hive connector can push dynamic filters into ORC and Parquet readers\n+  to perform stripe or row-group pruning.\n+* Connector support for utilizing dynamic filters at the splits enumeration stage.\n+* Size of right (build) side of join.\n+\n+To analyze if the planner is adding dynamic filters to a specific query's plan,\n+take a closer look at the :doc:`EXPLAIN plan </sql/explain>` of the query.\n+For example, the explain plan for the above query can be obtained by running::\n+\n+    EXPLAIN\n+    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM\n+    store_sales JOIN date_dim ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk\n+    WHERE d_following_holiday='Y' AND d_year = 2000;\n+\n+The explain plan for this query shows ``dynamicFilterAssignments`` in the\n+``InnerJoin`` node with dynamic filter ``df_370`` collected from build symbol ``d_date_sk``.\n+You can also see the ``dynamicFilter`` predicate as part of the Hive ``ScanFilterProject``\n+operator where ``df_370`` is associated with probe symbol ``ss_sold_date_sk``.\n+This shows you that the planner was successful in pushing dynamic filters\n+down to the connector in the query plan.\n+\n+.. code-block:: none\n+\n+    Fragment 0 [SINGLE]\n+        Output layout: [count]\n+        Output partitioning: SINGLE []\n+        Stage Execution Strategy: UNGROUPED_EXECUTION\n+        Output[_col0]\n+        \u2502   Layout: [count:bigint]\n+        \u2502   Estimates: {rows: ?

The cost-based optimizer can automatically\n+do this using table statistics provided by connectors. Therefore, it is recommended\n+to keep :doc:`table statistics </optimizer/statistics>` up to date and rely on the\n+CBO to correctly choose the smaller table on the build side of join.\n+\n+Collection of values of the join key columns from the build side for\n+dynamic filtering may incur additional CPU overhead during query execution.\n+Therefore, to limit the overheads of collecting dynamic filters\n+to the cases where the join operator is likely to be selective,\n+Presto defines thresholds on size of dynamic filters collected from build side tasks.\n+Collection of dynamic filters for joins with large build sides can be enabled\n+using the ``enable-large-dynamic-filters`` configuration property or the\n+``enable_large_dynamic_filters`` session property.\n+\n+When large dynamic filters are enabled, limits on size of dynamic filters can be\n+configured for each join distribution type using the configuration properties\n+``dynamic-filtering.large-broadcast.max-distinct-values-per-driver``,\n+``dynamic-filtering.large-broadcast.max-size-per-driver`` and\n+``dynamic-filtering.large-broadcast.range-row-limit-per-driver`` and their\n+equivalent for partitioned join distribution type.\n+\n+Similarly, limits for dynamic filters when ``enable-large-dynamic-filters``\n+is not enabled can be configured using configuration properties like\n+``dynamic-filtering.large-partitioned.max-distinct-values-per-driver``,\n+``dynamic-filtering.large-partitioned.max-size-per-driver`` and\n+``dynamic-filtering.large-partitioned.range-row-limit-per-driver`` and their\n+equivalent for broadcast join distribution type.\n+\n+The properties based on ``max-distinct-values-per-driver`` and ``max-size-per-driver``\n+define thresholds for the size up to which dynamic filters are collected in a\n+distinct values data structure. When the build side exceeds these thresholds,\n+Presto switches to collecting min and max values per column to reduce overheads.\n+This min-max filter has much lower granularity than the distinct values filter.\n+However, it may still be beneficial in filtering some data from the probe side,\n+especially when a range of values is selected from the build side of join.\n+The limits for min-max filters collection are defined by the properties\n+based on ``range-row-limit-per-driver``.\n+\n+Data layout considerations\n+--------------------------\n+\n+Dynamic filtering is most effective when a connector stores data in a layout that\n+can be leveraged for efficient filtering at runtime. For the Hive connector,\n+dynamic filter predicates are pushed into the ORC and Parquet readers on the\n+worker nodes to perform stripe or row-group pruning and save on disk I/O.\n+Sorting files by the columns used in join criteria significantly improves the\n+effectiveness of stripe or row-group pruning because sorting results in similar\n+data getting stored within the same stripe or row-group. This greatly improves the\n+selectivity of the min/max indexes maintained at stripe or row-group level.\n+\n+Partitioned Hive tables stored in any data format benefit from the\n+dynamic partition pruning optimization for broadcast as well as partitioned joins.\n+\n+Limitations\n+-----------\n+\n+* Dynamic filtering is currently implemented only for :doc:`/connector/hive` and :doc:`/connector/memory` connectors.\n+* Push down of dynamic filters into table scan is limited to broadcast joins.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5ODg4MTA2Ng=="}, "originalCommit": null, "originalPosition": 226}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMzEyMzE4MjY1OnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "presto-docs/src/main/sphinx/connector/hive.rst", "isResolved": true, "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMC0wMlQxNTowOTo0MlrOHbxV_w==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMC0wMlQxNTowOTo0MlrOHbxV_w==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5ODg4MjA0Nw==", "bodyText": "Maybe\nFor the Hive connector, a table scan can be delayed (for a configured amount of time)\nuntil the collection of dynamic filters by using the configuration property ...", "url": "https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/5348#discussion_r498882047", "createdAt": "2020-10-02T15:09:42Z", "author": {"login": "sopel39"}, "path": "presto-docs/src/main/sphinx/connector/hive.rst", "diffHunk": "@@ -526,6 +526,19 @@ You can also drop statistics for selected partitions only::\n \n     CALL system.drop_stats(schema_name, table_name, ARRAY[ARRAY['p2_value1', 'p2_value2']])\n \n+Delaying execution for dynamic filters\n+---------------------------------------\n+\n+It can often be beneficial to wait for collection of\n+:doc:`dynamic filters </admin/dynamic-filtering>` before starting a table scan.\n+This extra wait time can potentially result in significant overall savings\n+in query and CPU time, if dynamic filtering is able to reduce amount of scanned data.\n+\n+For the Hive connector, a table scan can be delayed for a configured amount", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": null, "originalPosition": 12}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMzEyMzg3NzM1OnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "presto-docs/src/main/sphinx/admin/dynamic-filtering.rst", "isResolved": false, "comments": {"totalCount": 3, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMC0wMlQxODo1MjoyN1rOHb4Q7Q==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMC0wMlQyMjoxMzowNVrOHb85Sw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5ODk5NTQzNw==", "bodyText": "should we update to\nDynamic filtering and dynamic partition pruning\n??", "url": "https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/5348#discussion_r498995437", "createdAt": "2020-10-02T18:52:27Z", "author": {"login": "mosabua"}, "path": "presto-docs/src/main/sphinx/admin/dynamic-filtering.rst", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,228 @@\n+=================\n+Dynamic Filtering", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": null, "originalPosition": 2}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5ODk5OTcwMw==", "bodyText": "I think it's ok for the title to be \"Dynamic filtering\" as partition pruning is just a special case of DF for Hive.

The cost-based optimizer can automatically\n+do this using table statistics provided by connectors. Therefore, it is recommended\n+to keep :doc:`table statistics </optimizer/statistics>` up to date and rely on the\n+CBO to correctly choose the smaller table on the build side of join.\n+\n+Collection of values of the join key columns from the build side for\n+dynamic filtering may incur additional CPU overhead during query execution.\n+Therefore, to limit the overhead of collecting dynamic filters\n+to the cases where the join operator is likely to be selective,\n+Presto defines thresholds on size of dynamic filters collected from build side tasks.\n+Collection of dynamic filters for joins with large build sides can be enabled\n+using the ``enable-large-dynamic-filters`` configuration property or the\n+``enable_large_dynamic_filters`` session property.\n+\n+When large dynamic filters are enabled, limits on size of dynamic filters can be\n+configured for each join distribution type using the configuration properties\n+``dynamic-filtering.large-broadcast.max-distinct-values-per-driver``,\n+``dynamic-filtering.large-broadcast.max-size-per-driver`` and\n+``dynamic-filtering.large-broadcast.range-row-limit-per-driver`` and their\n+equivalent for partitioned join distribution type.\n+\n+Similarly, limits for dynamic filters when ``enable-large-dynamic-filters``\n+is not enabled can be configured using configuration properties like\n+``dynamic-filtering.large-partitioned.max-distinct-values-per-driver``,\n+``dynamic-filtering.large-partitioned.max-size-per-driver`` and\n+``dynamic-filtering.large-partitioned.range-row-limit-per-driver`` and their\n+equivalent for broadcast join distribution type.\n+\n+The properties based on ``max-distinct-values-per-driver`` and ``max-size-per-driver``\n+define thresholds for the size up to which dynamic filters are collected in a\n+distinct values data structure. When the build side exceeds these thresholds,\n+Presto switches to collecting min and max values per column to reduce overhead.\n+This min-max filter has much lower granularity than the distinct values filter.\n+However, it may still be beneficial in filtering some data from the probe side,\n+especially when a range of values is selected from the build side of join.\n+The limits for min-max filters collection are defined by the properties\n+based on ``range-row-limit-per-driver``.\n+\n+Data layout considerations\n+--------------------------\n+\n+Dynamic filtering is most effective when a connector stores data in a layout that\n+can be leveraged for efficient filtering at runtime. For the Hive connector,\n+dynamic filter predicates are pushed into the ORC and Parquet readers on the\n+worker nodes to perform stripe or row-group pruning and save on disk I/O.\n+Sorting the data within ORC or Parquet files by the columns used in join criteria\n+significantly improves the effectiveness of stripe or row-group pruning.\n+This is because grouping similar data within the same stripe or row-group\n+greatly improves the selectivity of the min/max indexes maintained at\n+stripe or row-group level.\n+\n+Partitioned Hive tables stored in any data format benefit from the\n+dynamic partition pruning optimization for broadcast as well as partitioned joins.\n+\n+Limitations\n+-----------\n+\n+* Dynamic filtering is currently implemented only for
