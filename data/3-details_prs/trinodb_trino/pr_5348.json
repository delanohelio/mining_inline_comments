savings\n+in query runtime if dynamic filtering is able to eliminate a large amount\n+of unnecessary data from the probe side.\n+For the Hive connector, probe side table scan can be delayed for a configured\n+amount of time for the arrival of dynamic filters using the configuration property\n+``hive.dynamic-filtering-probe-blocking-timeout`` or the session property\n+``hive.dynamic_filtering_probe_blocking_timeout``.\n+\n+Dynamic filter collection thresholds\n+------------------------------------\n+\n+In order for dynamic filtering to work, the smaller dimension table needs to be chosen as a join\u2019s build side.\n+Cost-based optimizer can automatically do this using table statistics from the metastore.\n+Therefore, it is recommended to generate table statistics and rely on the CBO to correctly\n+choose the smaller table on the build side of join.\n+\n+Collection of values of the join key columns from the build side\n+for dynamic filtering

thresholds\n+------------------------------------\n+\n+In order for dynamic filtering to work, the smaller dimension table needs to be chosen as a join\u2019s build side.\n+Cost-based optimizer can automatically do this using table statistics provided by connectors.\n+Therefore, it is recommended to keep :doc:`table statistics </optimizer/statistics>`\n+up to date and rely on the CBO to correctly choose the smaller table on the build side of join.\n+\n+Collection of values of the join key columns from the build side\n+for dynamic filtering may incur additional CPU overhead during query execution.\n+Therefore, to limit the overheads of collecting dynamic filters\n+to the cases where the join operator is likely to be selective,\n+Presto defines thresholds on size of dynamic filters collected from build side tasks.\n+Collection of dynamic filters for joins with large build sides can be enabled\n+using the ``enable-large-dynamic-filters`` configuration property or the\n+``enable_large_dynamic_filters`` session property.\n+\n+When large dynamic filters are enabled, limits on size of dynamic filters can be configured\n+for each join distribution type using the configuration properties\n+``dynamic-filtering.large-broadcast.max-distinct-values-per-driver``,\n+``dynamic-filtering.large-broadcast.max-size-per-driver`` and\n+``dynamic-filtering.large-broadcast.range-row-limit-per-driver`` and their equivalent\n+for partitioned join distribution type.\n+\n+Similarly, limits for dynamic filters when ``enable-large-dynamic-filters`` is not enabled\n+can be configured using configuration properties like\n+``dynamic-filtering.large-partitioned.max-distinct-values-per-driver``,\n+``dynamic-filtering.large-partitioned.max-size-per-driver`` and\n+``dynamic-filtering.large-partitioned.range-row-limit-per-driver`` and their equivalent\n+for broadcast join distribution type.\n+\n+The properties based on ``max-distinct-values-per-driver`` and ``max-size-per-driver``\n+define thresholds for the size up to which dynamic filters are collected in a\n+distinct values data structure. When the build side exceeds these thresholds,\n+Presto switches to collecting min and max values per column to reduce overheads.\n+This min-max filter has much lower granularity than the distinct values filter.\n+However, it may still be beneficial in filtering some data from the probe side,\n+especially when a range of values is selected from the build side of join.\n+The limits for min-max filters collection are defined by the properties\n+based on ``range-row-limit-per-driver``.\n+\n+Data layout considerations\n+--------------------------", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": null, "originalPosition": 202}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NTAwNzA3NTc4", "url": "https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/5348#pullrequestreview-500707578", "createdAt": "2020-10-01T20:49:33Z", "commit": null, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMC0wMVQyMDo0OTozM1rOHbaWkg==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMC0wMVQyMDo0OTozM1rOHbaWkg==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5ODUwNTM2Mg==", "bodyText": "For the Hive connector", "url": "https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/5348#discussion_r498505362", "createdAt": "2020-10-01T20:49:33Z", "author": {"login": "mosabua"}, "path": "presto-docs/src/main/sphinx/admin/dynamic-filtering.rst", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,219 @@\n+=================\n+Dynamic Filtering\n+=================\n+\n+Dynamic filtering optimizations significantly improve the performance of queries\n+with selective joins by avoiding reading of data that would be filtered by join condition.\n+Consider the following query which captures a common pattern of a fact table ``store_sales``\n+joined with a filtered dimension table ``date_dim``:\n+\n+    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM\n+    store_sales JOIN date_dim ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk\n+    WHERE d_following_holiday='Y' AND d_year = 2000;\n+\n+Without dynamic filtering, Presto will push predicates for the dimension table to the\n+table scan on ``date_dim`` but it will scan all the data in the fact table since there\n+are no filters on ``store_sales`` in the query.

thresholds\n+------------------------------------\n+\n+In order for dynamic filtering to work, the smaller dimension table needs to be chosen as a join\u2019s build side.\n+Cost-based optimizer can automatically do this using table statistics provided by connectors.\n+Therefore, it is recommended to keep :doc:`table statistics </optimizer/statistics>`\n+up to date and rely on the CBO to correctly choose the smaller table on the build side of join.\n+\n+Collection of values of the join key columns from the build side\n+for dynamic filtering may incur additional CPU overhead during query execution.\n+Therefore, to limit the overheads of collecting dynamic filters\n+to the cases where the join operator is likely to be selective,\n+Presto defines thresholds on size of dynamic filters collected from build side tasks.\n+Collection of dynamic filters for joins with large build sides can be enabled\n+using the ``enable-large-dynamic-filters`` configuration property or the\n+``enable_large_dynamic_filters`` session property.\n+\n+When large dynamic filters are enabled, limits on size of dynamic filters can be configured\n+for each join distribution type using the configuration properties\n+``dynamic-filtering.large-broadcast.max-distinct-values-per-driver``,\n+``dynamic-filtering.large-broadcast.max-size-per-driver`` and\n+``dynamic-filtering.large-broadcast.range-row-limit-per-driver`` and their equivalent\n+for partitioned join distribution type.\n+\n+Similarly, limits for dynamic filters when ``enable-large-dynamic-filters`` is not enabled\n+can be configured using configuration properties like\n+``dynamic-filtering.large-partitioned.max-distinct-values-per-driver``,\n+``dynamic-filtering.large-partitioned.max-size-per-driver`` and\n+``dynamic-filtering.large-partitioned.range-row-limit-per-driver`` and their equivalent\n+for broadcast join distribution type.\n+\n+The properties based on ``max-distinct-values-per-driver`` and ``max-size-per-driver``\n+define thresholds for the size up to which dynamic filters are collected in a\n+distinct values data structure. When the build side exceeds these thresholds,\n+Presto switches to collecting min and max values per column to reduce overheads.\n+This min-max filter has much lower granularity than the distinct values filter.\n+However, it may still be beneficial in filtering some data from the probe side,\n+especially when a range of values is selected from the build side of join.\n+The limits for min-max filters collection are defined by the properties\n+based on ``range-row-limit-per-driver``.\n+\n+Data layout considerations\n+--------------------------\n+Dynamic filtering is most effective when a connector stores data in a layout that can\n+be leveraged for efficient filtering at runtime.\n+For Hive connector, dynamic filter predicates are pushed into the ORC and Parquet readers\n+on the worker nodes to perform stripe or row-group pruning and save on disk I/O.\n+Sorting files by the columns used in join criteria significantly improves the\n+effectiveness of stripe or row-group pruning. This is because sorting results in similar\n+data getting stored within the same stripe or row-group which greatly improves the\n+selectivity of the min/max indexes maintained at stripe or row-group level.\n+\n+Partitioned Hive tables stored in any data format benefit from the\n+dynamic partition pruning optimization for broadcast as well as partitioned joins.\n+\n+Limitations\n+-----------", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": null, "originalPosition": 216}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NTAwNzE4MjAz", "url": "https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/5348#pullrequestreview-500718203", "createdAt": "2020-10-01T21:06:08Z", "commit": null, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMC0wMVQyMTowNjowOFrOHba1DA==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMC0wMVQyMTowNjowOFrOHba1DA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5ODUxMzE2NA==", "bodyText": "I think we should remove that and add it to the connectors instead ..", "url": "https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/5348#discussion_r498513164", "createdAt": "2020-10-01T21:06:08Z", "author": {"login": "mosabua"}, "path": "presto-docs/src/main/sphinx/admin/dynamic-filtering.rst", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,219 @@\n+=================\n+Dynamic Filtering\n+=================\n+\n+Dynamic filtering optimizations significantly improve the performance of queries\n+with selective joins by avoiding reading of data that would be filtered by join condition.\n+Consider the following query which captures a common pattern of a fact table ``store_sales``\n+joined with a filtered dimension table ``date_dim``:\n+\n+    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM\n+    store_sales JOIN date_dim ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk\n+    WHERE d_following_holiday='Y' AND d_year = 2000;\n+\n+Without dynamic filtering, Presto will push predicates for the dimension table to the\n+table scan on ``date_dim`` but it will scan all the data in the fact table since there\n+are no filters on ``store_sales`` in the query.

The join operator will end up throwing away\n+most of the probe-side rows as the join criteria is highly selective.\n+\n+When dynamic filtering is enabled, Presto will collect candidate values for join condition\n+from the processed dimension table on the right side of join. In the case of broadcast joins,\n+the runtime predicates generated from this collection are pushed into the local table scan\n+on the left side of join running on the same worker.\n+Additionally, these runtime predicates are communicated to the coordinator over the network\n+so that dynamic filtering can also be performed on the coordinator during enumeration of\n+table scan splits. For example, in the case of Hive connector, dynamic filters are used\n+to skip loading of partitions which don't match the join criteria.\n+This is known as dynamic partition pruning.\n+\n+The results of dynamic filtering optimization can include the following benefits:\n+\n+* improved overall query performance\n+* reduced network traffic between Presto and the data source\n+* reduced load on the remote data source\n+\n+Support for push down of dynamic filters is specific to each connector\n+and the relevant underlying database or storage system.\n+\n+Analysis and Confirmation\n+-------------------------\n+\n+Dynamic filtering depends on a number of factors:\n+\n+* Planner support for dynamic filtering for a given join operation in Presto.\n+  Currently inner joins with equality join condition and semi-joins with IN conditions are supported.\n+* Connector support for utilizing dynamic filters pushed into table scan at runtime.\n+  For example, Hive connector can push dynamic filters into ORC and Parquet readers\n+  to perform stripe or row-group pruning.\n+* Connector support for utilizing dynamic filters at the splits enumeration stage.\n+* Size of right (build) side of join.\n+\n+To analyze if the planner is adding dynamic filters to a specific query's plan,\n+take a closer look at the :doc:`EXPLAIN plan </sql/explain>` of the query.\n+For example, the explain plan for the above query can be obtained by running::\n+\n+    EXPLAIN\n+    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM\n+    store_sales JOIN date_dim ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk\n+    WHERE d_following_holiday='Y' AND d_year = 2000;\n+\n+The explain plan for this query shows ``dynamicFilterAssignments`` in the\n+``InnerJoin`` node with dynamic filter ``df_370`` collected from build symbol ``d_date_sk``.\n+You can also see the ``dynamicFilter`` predicate as part of the Hive ``ScanFilterProject``\n+operator where ``df_370`` is associated with probe symbol ``ss_sold_date_sk``.\n+This shows you that the planner was successful in pushing dynamic filters\n+down to the connector in the query plan.\n+\n+.. code-block:: none\n+\n+    Fragment 0 [SINGLE]\n+        Output layout: [count]\n+        Output partitioning: SINGLE []\n+        Stage Execution Strategy: UNGROUPED_EXECUTION\n+        Output[_col0]\n+        \u2502   Layout: [count:bigint]\n+        \u2502   Estimates: {rows: ?

stripe or row-group\n+greatly improves the selectivity of the min/max indexes maintained at\n+stripe or row-group level.\n+\n+Partitioned Hive tables stored in any data format benefit from
