The code style template for the project can be found in the [codestyle](https://github.com/airlift/codestyle) repository along with our general programming and Java guidelines. In addition to those you should also adhere to the following:\n-\n-* Alphabetize sections in the documentation source files (both in the table of contents files and other regular documentation files). In general, alphabetize methods/variables/sections if such ordering already exists in the surrounding code.\n-* When appropriate, use the stream API. However, note that the stream implementation does not perform well so avoid using it in inner loops or otherwise performance sensitive sections.\n-* Categorize errors when throwing exceptions. For example, PrestoException takes an error code as an argument, `PrestoException(HIVE_TOO_MANY_OPEN_PARTITIONS)`. This categorization lets you generate reports so you can monitor the frequency of various failures.\n-* Ensure that all files have the appropriate license header; you can generate the license by running `mvn license:format`.\n-* Consider using String formatting (printf style formatting using the Java `Formatter` class): `format(\"Session property %s is invalid: %s\", name, value)` (note that `format()` should always be statically imported). Sometimes, if you only need to append something, consider using the `+` operator.\n-* Avoid using the ternary operator except for trivial expressions.\n-* Use an assertion from Airlift's `Assertions` class if there is one that covers your case rather than writing the assertion by hand. Over time we may move over to more fluent assertions like AssertJ.\n-* When writing a Git commit message, follow these [guidelines](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).\n-\n-### Additional IDE configuration\n-\n-When using IntelliJ to develop Presto, we recommend starting with all of the default inspections,\n-with some modifications.\n-\n-Enable the following inspections:\n-\n-- ``Java | Internationalization | Implicit usage of platform's default charset``,\n-- ``Java | Control flow issues | Redundant 'else'`` (including ``Report when there are no more statements after the 'if' statement`` option),\n-- ``Java | Class structure | Utility class is not 'final'``,\n-- ``Java | Class structure | Utility class with 'public' constructor``,\n-- ``Java | Class structure | Utility class without 'private' constructor``.\n-\n-Disable the following inspections:\n-\n-- ``Java | Performance | Call to 'Arrays.asList()' with too few arguments``,\n-- ``Java | Abstraction issues | 'Optional' used as field or parameter type``.\n-\n-Enable errorprone ([Error Prone Installation#IDEA](https://errorprone.info/docs/installation#intellij-idea)):\n-- Install ``Error Prone Compiler`` plugin from marketplace,\n-- In ``Java Compiler`` tab, select ``Javac with error-prone`` as the compiler,\n-- Update ``Additional command line parameters`` with ``-XepExcludedPaths:.*/target/generated-(|test-)sources/.* -XepDisableAllChecks -Xep:MissingOverride:ERROR ......`` (for current recommended list of command line parameters, see the top level ``pom.xml``, the definition of the ``errorprone-compiler-presto`` profile.\n-\n-### Building the Web UI\n-\n-The Presto Web UI is composed of several React components and is written in JSX and ES6. This source code is compiled and packaged into browser-compatible Javascript, which is then checked in to the Presto source code (in the `dist` folder).
