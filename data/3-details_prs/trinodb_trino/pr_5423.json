Please, read these release notes carefully.\n+```\n+\n+* Change file-based catalog access control from deny to allow when table, schema, or session property rules are not defined. ({issue}`5039`)\n+* Add missing table rule checks for table and view DDL in file-based system access control. ({issue}`5039`)\n+* Add missing schema rule checks for create schema in file-based system access control. ({issue}`5039`)\n+* Add session property rules to file-based system access control. ({issue}`5039`)\n+* Add catalog regex to table and schema rules in file-based system access control. ({issue}`5039`)\n+* Change create, rename, alter, and drop table in file-based system controls to only check for table ownership.  ({issue}`5039`)\n+* Change file-based system access control to support files without catalog rules defined.  In this case, all access to catalogs is allowed. ({issue}`5039`) \n+* Change file-based system and catalog access controls to only show catalogs, schemas, and tables a user has permissions on. ({issue}`5039`)\n+* Change file-based catalog access control to deny all permissions inspection and manipulation checks. ({issue}`5039`)\n+* Add [file-based group provider](/security/group-file).

({issue}`5472`)\n+* Hide Delta Lake tables from table listings like `SHOW TABLES` or `information_schema.tables`. The Delta\n+  Lake tables cannot be queries with Hive connector anyway. This can be enabled with `hive.hide-delta-lake-tables`\n+  catalog property. ({issue}`5430`)\n+* Improve query concurrency by listing data files more efficiently. ({issue}`5260`)\n+* Fix Parquet encoding for timestamps before 1970-01-01. ({issue}`5364`)\n+\n+## Kafka Connector Changes\n+\n+* Expose message timestamp via ``_timestamp`` internal column. ({issue}`4805`)\n+* Add predicate pushdown for ``_timestamp``, ``_partition_offset`` and ``_partition_id`` columns. ({issue}`4805`)\n+\n+## Phoenix Connector Changes\n+\n+* Fix query failure when a column name in `CREATE TABLE` requires quoting.

({issue}`5432`)\n+* Allow `CREATE TABLE` and `CREATE TABLE AS` with `timestamp` and `timestamp with time zone` with precision higher than 6.\n+  The resulting column will be declared with precision of 6, maximal supported by PostgreSQL.
