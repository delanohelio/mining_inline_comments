Likewise, the builder has DefaultScheduleEvent.Builder#resizable and DefaultScheduleEvent.Builder#draggable.\n\nRemarks\n\n\nThe Schedule component options resizable and draggable never had any effect because they were always overwritten by the isEditable() property on the ScheduleEvent. Also, editable is just a shortcut for resizable and draggable - but why can you set these individually on the component but not on the event? I changed it so that there is a isResizable() and isDraggable() on ScheduleEvent that is of type Boolean (null meaning that the default of the component is used). isEditable() is now deprecated. I also added two method resizable and draggable to the DefaultScheduleEvent.Builder.\n\n\nSome themes include custom CSS for FullCalendar. For the most part, everything still looks well. There's one minor issue - the colors in the list view are wrong e.g. for the nova theme. This repo only contains the minified CSS for the themes, not sure where the original sources are. If anybody could update the themes, that would be great.\n\n\n\n(^ The background color of the rows should be grey - also, on hover, the background turns grey and is almost unrecognizable.)", "createdAt": "2020-07-04T00:27:07Z", "url": "https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/pull/6107", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "e331c73ffa90a814074644627765ab78394888d6"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-07-10T11:21:26Z", "author": {"login": "blutorange"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 11, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABcq6eBLgH2gAyNDQ0MjE5MTM5OjVmMmFmYjQ2MTdjOGE0Njg4MTRiMWQ4M2JmMTFmNTk3OWYzM2Y0M2E=", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABcyUtOuAH2gAyNDQ0MjE5MTM5OmQ3ZGVkMDlmMzczYTMzZDVkMzYzM2RkZDRmZDM5ZDhiZjRkZDAyOWE=", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "5f2afb4617c8a468814b1d83bf11f5979f33f43a", "author": {"user": {"login": "blutorange", "name": "Andre Wachsmuth"}}, "url": "https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/commit/5f2afb4617c8a468814b1d83bf11f5979f33f43a", "committedDate": "2020-06-13T16:58:11Z", "message": "Schedule: Initial update to FullCalendar v5 (#5776)"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "d3b88150060d2642109a5d84d5bff3af65d0b495", "author": {"user": {"login": "blutorange", "name": "Andre Wachsmuth"}}, "url": "https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/commit/d3b88150060d2642109a5d84d5bff3af65d0b495", "committedDate": "2020-07-03T13:32:42Z", "message": "#5776 Update FullCalendar from beta to 5.1.0"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "548a875a16a7e9c80f6c35f7efb0570511a4518d", "author": {"user": {"login": "blutorange", "name": "Andre Wachsmuth"}}, "url": "https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/commit/548a875a16a7e9c80f6c35f7efb0570511a4518d", "committedDate": "2020-07-03T13:42:23Z", "message": "Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces into issue-5776-fullcalendarv5"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "32a06ebd12333fc1dc4fb4fea2cbf2bad5adc9c0", "author": {"user": {"login": "blutorange", "name": "Andre Wachsmuth"}}, "url": "https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/commit/32a06ebd12333fc1dc4fb4fea2cbf2bad5adc9c0", "committedDate": "2020-07-04T00:09:08Z", "message": "implement #5776: Update FullCalendar to v5, tested against showcase"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDQyNjA1MjAz", "url": "https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/pull/6107#pullrequestreview-442605203", "createdAt": "2020-07-04T11:44:44Z", "commit": {"oid": "32a06ebd12333fc1dc4fb4fea2cbf2bad5adc9c0"}, "state": "CHANGES_REQUESTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNy0wNFQxMTo0NDo0NFrOGs7jYQ==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNy0wNFQxMTo0ODowNFrOGs7kSw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0OTc2NjI0MQ==", "bodyText": "Should these be lower \"b\" booleans?", "url": "https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/pull/6107#discussion_r449766241", "createdAt": "2020-07-04T11:44:44Z", "author": {"login": "melloware"}, "path": "src/main/java/org/primefaces/model/DefaultScheduleEvent.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -183,8 +189,21 @@ public void setOverlapAllowed(boolean overlapAllowed) {\n         this.overlapAllowed = overlapAllowed;\n     }\n \n+    /**\n+     * Shortcut for calling both {@link #setDraggable(Boolean)} and\n+     * {@link #setResizable(Boolean)}.\n+     */\n     public void setEditable(boolean editable) {\n-        this.editable = editable;\n+        this.draggable = editable;\n+        this.resizable = editable;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setDraggable(Boolean draggable) {\n+        this.draggable = draggable;", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "32a06ebd12333fc1dc4fb4fea2cbf2bad5adc9c0"}, "originalPosition": 41}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0OTc2NjQ3NQ==", "bodyText": "Don't forget to update /docs/9_0/core/thirdpartylibs.md", "url": "https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/pull/6107#discussion_r449766475", "createdAt": "2020-07-04T11:48:04Z", "author": {"login": "melloware"}, "path": "docs/9_0/components/schedule.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -54,8 +54,8 @@ showWeekNumbers | false | Boolean | Display week numbers in schedule.\n extender | null | String | Name of JavaScript function to extend the options of the underlying FullCalendar plugin.\n displayEventEnd | null | String | Whether or not to display an event's end time text when it is rendered on the calendar.
