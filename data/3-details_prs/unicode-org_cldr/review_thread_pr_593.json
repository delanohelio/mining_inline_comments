Asking b/c I don't know Ansible, so I can't say if linting is more like validation / error-prone checking or if it is more like formatting style.\n\nThey are independent.   Amusingly, only the mac Github VMs have VT-x enabled to sublaunch an Ubuntu VM with vagrant. (Go figure, that's what Github support said somewhere.)  But the ansible-lint action is only Linux.\nThe linting is validation/error prone and deprecation checking. It \u201cmade\u201d me rewrite a 'notifier' to become a 'handler'.  The build step could pass if lint fails, but at this point I'd like to keep the linter happy since i'm newer to ansible. (I have been using it personally for a couple of years, but not as part of CD.)\n\nIf it linting is more than just strongly recommended (ex: in the ICU4X case, we treat warnings like errors), then you could make the build job depend on the lint job.\n\nDoes that mean running them in series?\n\nBut if the the build job or lint job take a long time, and/or one job's input does not necessarily depend on the success of output of the other job, then it makes sense to keep them un-linked as deps.\n\nThe build job takes a while because it spins up a VM.  Actually, one way I will want to refactor this, and I'm not sure entirely how, is to make the 'build' step deploy the cldr-apps.war artifact from the 'ant' workflow. It seems you cannot share artifacts across workflows, so this 'build' job may want to move to be a later step in the 'ant' workflow (which you reviewed the other day).  However, it would be good to make the 'ant' workflow more speedy before that, perhaps by making all of the long running tests a parallel step in 'ant'.\nI'll do this. I'll draw out a simple flowchart of where I think the build steps and artifacts need to go. One of the tensions here is premature optimization vs. caching.  I wince at all of those GB of data, downloaded anew each time, but I think the reason is because the buildbots are of course stateless independent throwaway units.
