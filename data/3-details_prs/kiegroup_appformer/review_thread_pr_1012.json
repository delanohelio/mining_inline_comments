On the other hand, it results on typescript also supported, which was not the goal for this task, but the editor doens't work for javascript without those libraries, I tested everything I could... So I think those should be there. yes :-(\nOn the other hand:\n\nWe're relying on not minimized packages for the monaco editor, as the production ones are not working properly (thanks to @karreiro for pointing this), so we could try to improve here when some newer library version appears.\nWe're adding this libraries for all editors, which is not efficient, agree.\n\nI can try to play around with POM's and modules and see if I can just include those libraries for the BPMN editor, not at platform level, but honestly don't know yet if it's possible or how tricky it results, will let you know.
