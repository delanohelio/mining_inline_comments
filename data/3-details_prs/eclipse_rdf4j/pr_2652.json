This is a minor release with about 29 improvements and bug fixes.\n+\n+For full details, have a look at the [release notes](/release-notes/3.5.0). Below, we briefly point out some of the bigger new things.\n+\n+<!--more-->\n+### Easier creation of IRIs and Literals\n+\n+We've introduced new static factory methods to make your Java code shorter and easier to read. For example, instead of:\n+\n+```java\n+ValueFactory valueFactory = SimpleValueFactory.getInstance();\n+\n+IRI uncleBob = valueFactory.createIRI(\"http://example.org/bob\");\n+IRI lastName = valueFactory.createIRI(\"http://example.org/name\");\n+Literal example = valueFactory.createLiteral(\"Example\");\n+\n+model.add(uncleBob, lastName, example);\n+```\n+\n+you can now use {{< javadoc \"Values\" \"model/util/Values.html\" >}} to do this:\n+\n+```java\n+import static org.eclipse.rdf4j.model.util.Values.*;\n+\n+model.add(iri(\"http://example.org/bob\"), iri(\"http://example.org/name\"), literal(\"Example\"));\n+```\n+\n+See the [RDF Model documentation](/documentation/programming/model) for more details.\n+\n+### Custom character encoding \n+\n+All {{< javadoc \"RDFWriter\" \"rio/RDFWriter.html\" >}} and {{< javadoc \"QueryResultWriter\" \"query/resultio/QueryResultWriter.html\" >}} implementations for character-based syntax formats now allow the use of a custom writer, with a user-defined custom encoding. Useful if you must produce a CSV file with Windows-encoding instead of the default UTF-8!\n+\n+### Creation of Literals with java.time values\n+\n+The new (well, new'ish) `java.time` API is a replacement for the older and clunkier `java.util.Date` and `java.util.Calendar` classes. The RDF4J {{< javadoc \"ValueFactory\" \"model/ValueFactory.html\" >}} (as well as the new {{< javadoc \"Values\" \"model/util/Values.html\" >}} static factory methods) now supports creation of `Literal` objects directly from `java.time` values, automatically applying the correct XML Schema datatype.\n+\n+### Peformance improvements\n+\n+We've made some major improvements in performance of SPARQL querying. Allowing direct result passthrough when querying a remote SPARQL endpoint can result in a reduction of result processing time up to 80-100%. Another area performance has been drastically improved is in the algorithms for ordering and comparing datatyped literals, which makes any SPARQL queries that involve `ORDER BY` clauses significantly quicker.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "cbc3fad87d8136b2bd6bb90f9b7af64609dc02e8"}, "originalPosition": 46}]}}, {"__typename": "HeadRefForcePushedEvent", "beforeCommit": {"oid": "7d79ddde75e2a8e537699c2104ddd959a456f7a9", "author": {"user": {"login": "jeenbroekstra", "name": "Jeen Broekstra"}}, "url": "https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/commit/7d79ddde75e2a8e537699c2104ddd959a456f7a9", "committedDate": "2020-12-08T02:48:04Z", "message": "Merge branch 'master' into GH-2547-release-notes-3.5.0"}, "afterCommit": {"oid": "6cec57e399001c98d410debf94e338229d0aa6cf", "author": {"user": {"login": "jeenbroekstra", "name": "Jeen Broekstra"}}, "url": "https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/commit/6cec57e399001c98d410debf94e338229d0aa6cf", "committedDate": "2020-12-08T02:52:38Z", "message": "GH-2547 release notes, news item and dowwnload links for 3.5.0"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "37cb966e457bd0a64dbea48ec23b3013c3333630", "author": {"user": {"login": "jeenbroekstra", "name": "Jeen Broekstra"}}, "url": "https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/commit/37cb966e457bd0a64dbea48ec23b3013c3333630", "committedDate": "2020-12-08T02:54:48Z", "message": "GH-2547 release notes, news item and dowwnload links for 3.5.0"}}, {"__typename": "HeadRefForcePushedEvent", "beforeCommit": {"oid": "6cec57e399001c98d410debf94e338229d0aa6cf", "author": {"user": {"login": "jeenbroekstra", "name": "Jeen Broekstra"}}, "url": "https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/commit/6cec57e399001c98d410debf94e338229d0aa6cf", "committedDate": "2020-12-08T02:52:38Z", "message": "GH-2547 release notes, news item and dowwnload links for 3.5.0"}, "afterCommit": {"oid": "37cb966e457bd0a64dbea48ec23b3013c3333630", "author": {"user": {"login": "jeenbroekstra", "name": "Jeen Broekstra"}}, "url": "https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/commit/37cb966e457bd0a64dbea48ec23b3013c3333630", "committedDate": "2020-12-08T02:54:48Z", "message": "GH-2547 release notes, news item and dowwnload links for 3.5.0"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "263dcaa22dc22f18eaa32ab651dc4681575afd68", "author": {"user": {"login": "jeenbroekstra", "name": "Jeen Broekstra"}}, "url": "https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/commit/263dcaa22dc22f18eaa32ab651dc4681575afd68", "committedDate": "2020-12-09T03:05:48Z", "message": "GH-25447 add anqit to acknowledgements"}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 81, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-01T13:51:04Z"}}}
