Useful if you must produce a CSV file with Windows-encoding instead of the default UTF-8!\n+\n+### Creation of Literals with java.time values\n+\n+The new (well, new'ish) `java.time` API is a replacement for the older and clunkier `java.util.Date` and `java.util.Calendar` classes. The RDF4J {{< javadoc \"ValueFactory\" \"model/ValueFactory.html\" >}} (as well as the new {{< javadoc \"Values\" \"model/util/Values.html\" >}} static factory methods) now supports creation of `Literal` objects directly from `java.time` values, automatically applying the correct XML Schema datatype.\n+\n+### Peformance improvements\n+\n+We've made some major improvements in performance of SPARQL querying. Allowing direct result passthrough when querying a remote SPARQL endpoint can result in a reduction of result processing time up to 80-100%.
