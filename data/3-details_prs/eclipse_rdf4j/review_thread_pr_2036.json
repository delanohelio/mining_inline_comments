Or will it just crash with a ClassNotFoundException? Don't bother if this is a massive effort but if we can do a simple check and have a fallback that (no matter how ineffecient) at least works, it makes the \"optional\" story a bit more convincing :)", "url": "https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/pull/2036#discussion_r396788276", "createdAt": "2020-03-23T22:13:25Z", "author": {"login": "jeenbroekstra"}, "path": "core/sail/extensible-store/pom.xml", "diffHunk": "@@ -46,7 +46,9 @@\n                     <groupId>org.asynchttpclient</groupId>\n                 </exclusion>\n             </exclusions>\n-        </dependency>\n+\t\t\t<scope>provided</scope>", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "2fc4501d275622230287e461cf1b6a9606b89b6b"}, "originalPosition": 5}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5OTE1NDM4Mg==", "bodyText": "Changed it to optional.", "url": "https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/pull/2036#discussion_r399154382", "createdAt": "2020-03-27T10:03:16Z", "author": {"login": "hmottestad"}, "path": "core/sail/extensible-store/pom.xml", "diffHunk": "@@ -46,7 +46,9 @@\n                     <groupId>org.asynchttpclient</groupId>\n                 </exclusion>\n             </exclusions>\n-        </dependency>\n+\t\t\t<scope>provided</scope>", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5Njc4ODI3Ng=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "2fc4501d275622230287e461cf1b6a9606b89b6b"}, "originalPosition": 5}]}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 1548, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-12T18:49:56Z"}}}
