But then there are cases where we have to disable the turn costs although they are enabled in the profile, for example for Isochrones (because they are only implemented for node-based graph traversal so far) and for LM preparation (also not implemented edge-based and the preparation is even more useful when turn costs are excluded (can be used for queries with and without turn costs)). So we need a second flag to disable turn costs also for profiles that include turn costs. This second flag is what makes disabling the turn costs special. In principle it could also go into the hints parameter, but it is  slightly different than the other hints in that it is only set internally vs. something the user can change via the request.\n\nShouldn't the caller of createWeighting be able to create a Weighting and only use edge weights?\n\nNot sure if I understand the question, but yes thats totally possible with the disableTurnCosts flag.\n\nIsn't the meaning very similar in the sense that we ask the profile to ignore turn costs?
