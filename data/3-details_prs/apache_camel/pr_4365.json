{"data": {"repository": {"pullRequest": {"id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDk3OTAxMDQ2", "number": 4365, "title": "Throttles strimzi startup to prevent resource reuse errors", "bodyText": "This works around sporadic errors raised by docker during the tear\nup/down cycle of the tests. This seems to happen because, although the\ncontainers are reportedly terminated, some of their resources may still\nbe utilized at the time of the start of the new test.\nThis is likely a problem elsewhere, but this patch adds a work-around\nfor this.\n\nObs.: it sourcecheck seems to complain about StrimziService class formatting without giving much details about the failure. I tried reformating it several times without success. I am trying a PR in the hope it is a problem w/ the check and not w/ the file formatting itself.\n\n Make sure there is a JIRA issue filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\n Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\n If you're unsure, you can format the pull request title like [CAMEL-XXX] Fixes bug in camel-file component, where you replace CAMEL-XXX with the appropriate JIRA issue.\n Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\n Run mvn clean install -Psourcecheck in your module with source check enabled to make sure basic checks pass and there are no checkstyle violations. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\nBelow are the contribution guidelines:\nhttps://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md", "createdAt": "2020-10-05T14:35:37Z", "url": "https://github.com/apache/camel/pull/4365", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "f49a942595db3bddea3778484341a50fe31a73c4"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-10-05T17:29:14Z", "author": {"login": "orpiske"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 4, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABdPkztrAFqTUwMjEyNTMzNA==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABdPmIANABqjM4NDEyOTQ3OTY=", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NTAyMTI1MzM0", "url": "https://github.com/apache/camel/pull/4365#pullrequestreview-502125334", "createdAt": "2020-10-05T14:39:10Z", "commit": {"oid": "a0c696c4903c221733604b5a9bf696717c162abf"}, "state": "APPROVED", "comments": {"totalCount": 0, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": null, "endCursor": null, "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": []}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NTAyMjAzNDAz", "url": "https://github.com/apache/camel/pull/4365#pullrequestreview-502203403", "createdAt": "2020-10-05T16:01:32Z", "commit": {"oid": "a0c696c4903c221733604b5a9bf696717c162abf"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMC0wNVQxNjowMTozMlrOHcjwHQ==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMC0wNVQxNjowMTozMlrOHcjwHQ==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5OTcwNzkzMw==", "bodyText": "Sourcecheck complains about this line with one tab/spaces.
