easily consumed by applications and services.\n \n // Type: concept\n // Title: Overview of {prodname} SQL Server connector \n // ModuleID: overview-of-debezium-sql-server-connector\n [[sqlserver-overview]]\n == Overview\n \n-The functionality of the connector is based upon https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/track-changes/about-change-data-capture-sql-server?view=sql-server-2017[change data capture] feature provided by SQL Server Standard (https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/sqlreleaseservices/sql-server-2016-service-pack-1-sp1-released/[since SQL Server 2016 SP1]) or Enterprise edition.\n-Using this mechanism a SQL Server capture process monitors all databases and tables the user is interested in and stores the changes into specifically created _CDC_ tables that have stored procedure facade.\n-\n-The database operator must https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/track-changes/enable-and-disable-change-data-capture-sql-server?view=sql-server-2017[enable] _CDC_ for the table(s) that should be captured by the connector.\n-The connector then produces a _change event_ for every row-level insert, update, and delete operation that was published via the _CDC API_, recording all the change events for each table in a separate Kafka topic.\n-The client applications read the Kafka topics that correspond to the database tables they're interested in following, and react to every row-level event it sees in those topics.\n-\n-The database operator normally enables _CDC_ in the mid-life of a database an/or table.\n-This means that the connector does not have the complete history of all changes that have been made to the database.\n-Therefore, when the SQL Server connector first connects to a particular SQL Server database, it starts by performing a _consistent snapshot_ of each of the database schemas.\n-After the connector completes the snapshot, it continues streaming changes from the exact point at which the snapshot was made.\n-This way, we start with a consistent view of all of the data, yet continue reading without having lost any of the changes made while the snapshot was taking place.\n-\n-The connector is also tolerant of failures.\n-As the connector reads changes and produces events, it records the position in the database log (_LSN / Log Sequence Number_), that is associated with _CDC_ record, with each event.\n-If the connector stops for any reason (including communication failures, network problems, or crashes), upon restart it simply continues reading the _CDC_ tables where it last left off.\n-This includes snapshots: if the snapshot was not completed when the connector is stopped, upon restart it begins a new snapshot.\n+The {prodname} SQL Server connector is based on the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/track-changes/about-change-data-capture-sql-server?view=sql-server-2017[change data capture] \n+feature that is available in https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/sqlreleaseservices/sql-server-2016-service-pack-1-sp1-released/[SQL Server 2016 Service Pack 1 (SP1) and later] Standard edition or Enterprise edition.\n+The SQL Server capture process monitors designated databases and tables, and stores the changes into specifically created _change tables_ that have stored procedure facades.\n+\n+To enable the {prodname} SQL Server connector to capture change event records for database operations, \n+you must first enable change data capture on the SQL Server database. \n+CDC must be enabled on both the database and on each table that you want to track.\n+After you set up CDC on the source database, the connector can capture row-level `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations  \n+that occur in the database.\n+The connector writes event records for each source table to a Kafka topic especially dedicated to that table.\n+One topic exists for each tracked table.\n+Client applications read the Kafka topics for the database tables that they follow, and can respond to the row-level events they they consume from those topics.\n+\n+The first time that the connector connects to a SQL Server database or cluster, it takes a consistent snapshot of the schemas for all tables for which it is configured to capture changes,\n+and streams this state to Kafka.\n+After the snapshot is complete, the connector continuously captures subsequent row-level changes that occur.\n+By first establishing a consistent view of all of the data, the connector can continue reading without having lost any of the changes that were made while the snapshot was taking place.\n+\n+The {prodname} SQL Server connector is tolerant of failures.\n+As the connector reads changes and produces events, it records the position in the database log (_LSN / Log Sequence Number_) for each event.\n+If the connector stops for any reason (including communication failures, network problems, or crashes), after a restart the connector resumes reading the SQL Server _CDC_ tables from the last point that it read.\n+Fault tolerance also applies to snapshots. \n+That is, if the connector stops during a snapshot, the connector begins a news snapshot when it restarts.\n \n // Type: assembly\n // ModuleID: how-debezium-sql-server-connectors-work\n // Title: How {prodname} SQL Server connectors work\n [[how-the-sqlserver-connector-works]]\n == How the SQL Server connector works\n \n+To optimally configure and run a {prodname} SQL Server connector, it is helpful to understand how the connector performs snapshots, streams change events, determines Kafka topic names, and uses metadata. \n+ifdef::product[]\n+For details about how the connector works, see the following sections: \n+\n+*

connectors perform database snapshots\n [[sqlserver-snapshots]]\n === Snapshots\n \n-SQL Server CDC is not designed to store the complete history of database changes.\n-It is thus necessary that {prodname} establishes the baseline of current database content and streams it to the Kafka.\n-This is achieved via a process called snapshotting.\n+SQL Server CDC is not designed to store a complete history of database changes.\n+For the {prodname} SQL Server connector to establish a baseline for the current state of the database, \n+it uses a process called _snapshotting_.\n \n-By default (snapshotting mode *initial*) the connector will upon the first startup perform an initial _consistent snapshot_ of the database\n-(meaning the structure and data within any tables to be captured as per the connector's filter configuration).\n+You can configure how the connector creates snapshots.\n+By default, the connector's snapshot mode is set to `initial`. \n+Based on this `initial` snapshot mode, the first time that the connector starts, it performs an initial _consistent snapshot_ of the database.\n+This initial snapshot captures the structure and data for any tables that match the criteria defined by the `include` and `exclude` properties that are configured for the connector (for example, `table.include.list`, `column.include.list`, `table.exclude.list`, and so forth).\n \n-Each snapshot consists of the following steps:\n+When the connector creates a snapshot, it completes the following tasks:\n \n-1. Determine the tables to be captured\n-2. Obtain a lock on each of the monitored tables to ensure that no structural changes can occur to any of the tables.\n+1.

connectors perform database snapshots\n [[sqlserver-snapshots]]\n === Snapshots\n \n-SQL Server CDC is not designed to store the complete history of database changes.\n-It is thus necessary that {prodname} establishes the baseline of current database content and streams it to the Kafka.\n-This is achieved via a process called snapshotting.\n+SQL Server CDC is not designed to store a complete history of database changes.\n+For the {prodname} SQL Server connector to establish a baseline for the current state of the database, \n+it uses a process called _snapshotting_.\n \n-By default (snapshotting mode *initial*) the connector will upon the first startup perform an initial _consistent snapshot_ of the database\n-(meaning the structure and data within any tables to be captured as per the connector's filter configuration).\n+You can configure how the connector creates snapshots.\n+By default, the connector's snapshot mode is set to `initial`. \n+Based on this `initial` snapshot mode, the first time that the connector starts, it performs an initial _consistent snapshot_ of the database.\n+This initial snapshot captures the structure and data for any tables that match the criteria defined by the `include` and `exclude` properties that are configured for the connector (for example, `table.include.list`, `column.include.list`, `table.exclude.list`, and so forth).\n \n-Each snapshot consists of the following steps:\n+When the connector creates a snapshot, it completes the following tasks:\n \n-1. Determine the tables to be captured\n-2. Obtain a lock on each of the monitored tables to ensure that no structural changes can occur to any of the tables.\n+1. Determines the tables to be captured.\n+2. Obtains a lock on each of the monitored tables to ensure that no structural changes can occur to any of the tables.\n The level of the lock is determined by `snapshot.isolation.mode` configuration option.\n-3. Read the maximum LSN (\"log sequence number\") position in the server's transaction log.\n-4. Capture the structure of all relevant tables.\n-5. Optionally release the locks obtained in step 2, i.e. the locks are held usually only for a short period of time.\n-6. Scan all of the relevant database tables and schemas as valid at the LSN position read in step 3, and generate a `READ` event for each row and write that event to the appropriate table-specific Kafka topic.\n-7. Record the successful completion of the snapshot in the connector offsets.\n+3. Reads the maximum log sequence number (LSN) position in the server's transaction log.\n+4. Captures the structure of all relevant tables.\n+5. Releases the locks obtained in Step 2, if necessary. In most cases, locks are held for only a short period of time.\n+6. Scans all of the relevant database tables and schemas based on the LSN position that it read in Step 3, generates a `READ` event for each row, and writes the events to the Kafka topic for the table.\n+7.

[[sqlserver-overview]]\n == Overview\n \n-The functionality of the connector is based upon https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/track-changes/about-change-data-capture-sql-server?view=sql-server-2017[change data capture] feature provided by SQL Server Standard (https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/sqlreleaseservices/sql-server-2016-service-pack-1-sp1-released/[since SQL Server 2016 SP1]) or Enterprise edition.\n-Using this mechanism a SQL Server capture process monitors all databases and tables the user is interested in and stores the changes into specifically created _CDC_ tables that have stored procedure facade.\n+The {prodname} SQL Server connector is based on the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/track-changes/about-change-data-capture-sql-server?view=sql-server-2017[change data capture] \n+feature that is available in https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/sqlreleaseservices/sql-server-2016-service-pack-1-sp1-released/[SQL Server 2016 Service Pack 1 (SP1) and later] Standard edition or Enterprise edition.\n+The SQL Server capture process monitors designated databases and tables, and stores the changes into specifically created _change tables_ that have stored procedure facades.\n+\n+To enable the {prodname} SQL Server connector to capture change event records for database operations, \n+you must first enable change data capture on the SQL Server database. \n+CDC must be enabled on both the database and on each table that you want to capture.\n+After you set up CDC on the source database, the connector can capture row-level `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations  \n+that occur in the database.\n+The connector writes event records for each source table to a Kafka topic especially dedicated to that table.\n+One topic exists for each captured table.\n+Client applications read the Kafka topics for the database tables that they follow, and can respond to the row-level events they they consume from those topics.\n+\n+The first time that the connector connects to a SQL Server database or cluster, it takes a consistent snapshot of the schemas for all tables for which it is configured to capture changes,\n+and streams this state to Kafka.\n+After the snapshot is complete, the connector continuously captures subsequent row-level changes that occur.\n+By first establishing a consistent view of all of the data, the connector can continue reading without having lost any of the changes that were made while the snapshot was taking place.\n \n-The database operator must https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/track-changes/enable-and-disable-change-data-capture-sql-server?view=sql-server-2017[enable] _CDC_ for the table(s) that should be captured by the connector.\n-The connector then produces a _change event_ for every row-level insert, update, and delete operation that was published via the _CDC API_, recording all the change events for each table in a separate Kafka topic.\n-The client applications read the Kafka topics that correspond to the database tables they're interested in following, and react to every row-level event it sees in those topics.\n+The {prodname} SQL Server connector is tolerant of failures.\n+As the connector reads changes and produces events, it periodically records the position of events in the database log (_LSN / Log Sequence Number_).\n+If the connector stops for any reason (including communication failures, network problems, or crashes), after a restart the connector resumes reading the SQL Server _CDC_ tables from the last point that it read.\n \n-The database operator normally enables _CDC_ in the mid-life of a database an/or table.\n-This means that the connector does not have the complete history of all changes that have been made to the database.\n-Therefore, when the SQL Server connector first connects to a particular SQL Server database, it starts by performing a _consistent snapshot_ of each of the database schemas.\n-After the connector completes the snapshot, it continues streaming changes from the exact point at which the snapshot was made.\n-This way, we start with a consistent view of all of the data, yet continue reading without having lost any of the changes made while the snapshot was taking place.\n+NOTE: Offsets are committed periodically. \n+They are not committed at the time that a change event occurs. \n+As a result, following an outage, duplicate events might be generated.\n \n-The connector is also tolerant of failures.\n-As the connector reads changes and produces events, it records the position in the database log (_LSN / Log Sequence Number_), that is associated with _CDC_ record, with each event.\n-If the connector stops for any reason (including communication failures, network problems, or crashes), upon restart it simply continues reading the _CDC_ tables where it last left off.\n-This includes snapshots: if the snapshot was not completed when the connector is stopped, upon restart it begins a new snapshot.\n+Fault tolerance also applies to snapshots. \n+That is, if the connector stops during a snapshot, the connector begins a news snapshot when it restarts.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "c2ff94b823bcaeeaa91fd6bed90f269bbf66ac59"}, "originalPosition": 85}]}}, {"__typename":
