Add your image file to the `documentation/modules/ROOT/assets/images` directory.\n+2. Reference the image using the syntax `image::MY_IMAGE.png[]` (or for an inline image, `image:MY_IMAGE.png[]`).\n+\n+At build time, AsciiDoc reads the value of the standard `imagesdir` attribute to discover the location of images.\n+There is no need to set this attribute yourself, it is already defined for you.\n+Note that if you view or render a _single_ AsciiDoc file, you will not be able to view the image.\n+Because of the way the images are organized (in combination with the `imagesdir` attribute), you can only see the images correctly rendered when you build the whole documentation set using Antora.\n+\n+### Best practices\n+\n+Note the following additional recommendations:\n+\n+* If your contribution also involves reformatting large amounts of text (modifying white space, line breaks, and so on), please make these reformatting updates in a _separate_ commit.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "64d4b09c4c7e241f1300f002fbe36d628a9d83f5"}, "originalPosition": 81}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMjI3NzM5MzI5OnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "documentation/modules/ROOT/pages/connectors/mongodb.adoc", "isResolved": false, "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMS0yMFQxMjowNzoyMlrOFfcVhQ==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMS0yMFQxMjowNzoyMlrOFfcVhQ==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM2ODUxNDQzNw==", "bodyText": "This sentence is duplicated now.
