We have those in other connector docs to customize contents between what's shown in the community docs (i.e. on debezium.io/docs) and what's shown in downstream product docs. As this connector is only part of the community distribution, we just can go with a single flavour of these contents and remove the conditionals. Should we decide to include this connector in the downstream offering, we'd revisit this, but then Red Hat docs writers will be able to help with the job.
