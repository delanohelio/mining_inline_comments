The HBase repository\n+places this file under `dev-support/docker/Dockerfile`.\n+\n+## JVM and JAVA_HOME\n+\n+HBase supports compilation and test execution on a number of different JVM\n+versions. To facilitate this, the `Dockerfile` installs multiple JVMs. An\n+invocation of `test-patch` requires additional parameters in order to specify\n+the target JVM. How you do this is slightly different based on whether you run\n+with or without Docker mode.\n+\n+### Setting `JAVA_HOME` Outside of Docker Mode\n+\n+Simply specify `JAVA_HOME` in the environment in which `test-patch` is launched.\n+\n+### Setting `JAVA_HOME` Inside of Docker Mode\n+\n+The docker image JDKs are available under `/usr/lib/jvm`. Symlinks are provided\n+for each supported major version, i.e., `java-11`. Use the `test-patch` argument\n+`--java-home`.\n+\n+# Example: Run SpotBugs\n+\n+One of the checks supported by Yetus is the static analysis tool\n+[SpotBugs][spotbugs]. Let's put together all the above and run SpotBugs with\n+`test-patch`.\n+\n+The SpotBugs check depends on a SpotBugs installation. This is provided by the\n+docker file. For running without docker, you'll need to download and unpack the\n+SpotBugs binary distribution.\n+\n+Running the SpotBugs check also depends on [Apache Maven][maven], the build\n+system used by HBase. In order for the check to function, both the `maven`\n+and `spotbugs` plugins must be specified. If this dependency is omitted, Yetus\n+will error with a message similar to\n+\n+```\n+ERROR: you can't specify maven as the buildtool if you don't enable the plugin.\n+```\n+\n+To run just the SpotBugs check, we must explicitly specify `spotbugs` and its\n+dependency using `--plugins=maven,spotbugs`.\n+\n+## Without Docker\n+\n+Putting it all together, without using docker:\n+\n+```shell script\n+$ cd /path/to/hbase\n+$ JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk-8 test-patch.sh \\", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "ec5dbfa1c6c8189dcdd1b25edd10724a5d34d47b"}, "originalPosition": 136}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Mzg4Njg4NjI2", "url": "https://github.com/apache/hbase/pull/1392#pullrequestreview-388688626", "createdAt": "2020-04-06T23:32:29Z", "commit": {"oid": "ec5dbfa1c6c8189dcdd1b25edd10724a5d34d47b"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNC0wNlQyMzozMjoyOVrOGBtp7w==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNC0wNlQyMzozMjoyOVrOGBtp7w==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwNDQ0OTc3NQ==", "bodyText": "Yes they appear to.
