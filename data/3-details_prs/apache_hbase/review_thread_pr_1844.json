The\n+icon:times-circle[role=\"red\"] means that support has been dropped for this version or has been\n+attempted and is known to not work. For combinations of newer JDK with older HBase releases, it's\n+likely that there are known compatibility issues that cannot be addressed under our compatibility\n+guarantees, making that combination impossible. In some cases, specific guidance on limitations\n+(e.g. whether compiling / unit tests work, specific operational issues, etc) will also be noted.\n+\n+.Long-Term Support JDKs are Recommended\n+[WARNING]\n+====\n+HBase recommends downstream users rely on JDK releases that are marked as Long-Term Supported\n+(LTS), either from the OpenJDK project or vendors. At the time of this writing, the following JDK\n+releases are NOT LTS releases and are NOT supported by the Apache HBase community: JDK9, JDK10,\n+JDK12, JDK13, and JDK14. Community discussion around this decision is recorded on\n+link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-20264[HBASE-20264].\n+====\n \n-.Long Term Support JDKs are recommended\n+.HotSpot vs. OpenJ9\n [TIP]\n ====\n-HBase recommends downstream users rely on JDK releases that are marked as Long Term Supported (LTS)\n-either from the OpenJDK project or vendors. As of March 2018 that means Java 8 is the only\n-applicable version and that the next likely version to see testing will be Java 11 near Q3 2018.\n+At this time, all testing performed by the Apache HBase project runs on the HotSpot variant of the\n+JVM. When selecting your JDK distribution, please take this into consideration.\n ====\n \n .Java support by release line\n-[cols=\"6*^.^\", options=\"header\"]\n+[cols=\"4*^.^\", options=\"header\"]\n |===\n-|HBase Version\n-|JDK 7\n-|JDK 8\n-|JDK 9 (Non-LTS)\n-|JDK 10 (Non-LTS)\n-|JDK 11\n-\n-|2.1+\n+|Java Version\n+|HBase 1.3+\n+|HBase 2.1+\n+|HBase 2.3+\n+\n+|JDK6\n+|icon:times-circle[role=\"red\"]\n |icon:times-circle[role=\"red\"]\n+|icon:times-circle[role=\"red\"]\n+\n+|JDK7\n+|icon:check-circle[role=\"green\"]\n+|icon:times-circle[role=\"red\"]\n+|icon:times-circle[role=\"red\"]\n+\n+|JDK8\n |icon:check-circle[role=\"green\"]", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzNDc5MzcwMw=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "6667b2ef13c30a31fd91c67a58be8d382cf212fc"}, "originalPosition": 71}]}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 2932, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-11T21:28:48Z"}}}
