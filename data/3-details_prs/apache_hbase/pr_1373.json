Ideally, I'd think it should be async on the server side too, meaning the rpc call just sets a flag (startShuttingDown = true) which is read by multiple running threads and they begin the tear down rather than doing it in the context of the rpc thread. We already do this partially but the main driver of master shutdown still runs in the rpc context. Don't think this should block the test, but just something for the future.
