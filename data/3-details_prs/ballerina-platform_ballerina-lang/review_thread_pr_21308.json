Therefore, when eviction happens, cache entries can be removed efficiently, without iterating the complete map data structure.\n+\n+**Example:** If the eviction policy is LRU, always the MRU item will be the head of the linked list. When eviction happens, nodes from the tail will be deleted without iterating the map.\n+\n+Further, developers can implement a custom caching implementations based on different cache storage mechanisms (file, database etc.) and different eviction policies (MRU, FIFO etc.) as they wish. Ballerina provides a \"map-based cache\" as the default cache implementation.\n+\n+### Samples\n+\n+#### Cache Initialization\n+\n+A basic sample cache of 100 capacity, which uses LRU as the eviction policy and eviction factor is 0.25 is as follows:\n+```ballerina\n+cache:Cache cache = new;\n+```\n+\n+A basic sample cache of 1000 capacity, the eviction factor is 0.2, cache entry default freshness time as 1 hour, and clean up timer configured with 5 seconds interval  is as follows:\n+```ballerina\n+cache:Cache cache = new({\n+    capacity: 1000,\n+    evictionFactor: 0.2,\n+    defaultMaxAgeInSeconds: 3600\n+    cleanupIntervalInSeconds: 5\n+});\n+```\n+\n+An advanced sample cache which uses a custom eviction policy along with the default capacity, eviction factor, max age and cleanup interval is as follows:\n+```ballerina\n+public type CustomEvictionPolicy object {\n+    *cache:AbstractEvictionPolicy;\n+    public function get(LinkedList list, Node node) { // custom implementation }\n+    public function put(LinkedList list, Node node) { // custom implementation }\n+    public function remove(LinkedList list, Node node) { // custom implementation }\n+    public function replace(LinkedList list, Node newNode, Node oldNode) { // custom implementation }\n+    public function clear(LinkedList list) { // custom implementation }\n+    public function evict(LinkedList list) returns Node? { // custom implementation }\n+}\n+\n+cache:Cache cache = new({\n+    capacity: 1000,\n+    evictionPolicy: new CustomEvictionPolicy()\n+});\n+```\n+\n+#### Cache Usage\n+\n+The simple way of using the initialized cache without handling errors is as follows:\n+```ballerina\n+_ = check cache.put(\"key1\", \"value1\");\n+string value = <string> check cache.get(\"key1\");\n+_ = check cache.invalidate(\"key1\");\n+_ = check cache.invalidateAll();\n+boolean hasKey = cache.hasKey(\"key1\");\n+string[] keys = cache.keys();\n+int size = cache.size();\n+int capacity = cache.capacity();\n+```\n+\n+The advanced way of using the initialized cache with error handling is as follows:\n+```ballerina\n+cache:Error? result = cache.put(\"key1\", \"value1\");\n+if (result is cache:Error) {\n+    // implement what to do, if any error happen when inserting item to cache\n+}\n+\n+any|cache:Error result = cache.get(\"key1\");\n+if (result is cache:Error) {\n+    // implement what to do, if any error happen when retrieving item from the cache", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "7ffc61bfe381eb5a03befddc31222f9eace1c97f"}, "originalPosition": 161}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMjQxNzQxOTM1OnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "examples/cache/cache.bal", "isResolved": true, "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMy0xMFQwNDozMToxMFrOF0BODw==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMy0xMFQwNDozMToxMFrOF0BODw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5MDA5MDI1NQ==", "bodyText": "This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.
