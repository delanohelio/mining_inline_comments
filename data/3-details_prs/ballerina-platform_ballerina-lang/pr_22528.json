The module facilitates two types of endpoints called `Client` and `Listener`.\n+#### TCP Client endpoints\n+The `socket:Client` is used to connect to a socket server and interact with it. The client can only send the data to the server and the client's `callbackService` can retrieve the data from the server and do multiple requests/responses between the client and the server.\n \n-## Samples\n+A Client endpoint can be defined by providing host and port as follows:\n \n-### TCP Listener endpoints\n-The sample given below shows how a listener is used to listen to the incoming socket request. The `onConnect(socket:Caller)` resource function gets invoked when a new client is connected.
