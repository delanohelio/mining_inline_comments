Please refer the MySQL module [API docs](https://ballerina.io/learn/api-docs/ballerina/mysql/index.html) \n+for more details.\n+\n+\n+### Client\n+\n+The database client should be created by any of the above listed database modules, and once it is created the \n+below explained operations and functionality can be used. \n+\n+#### Connection pool handling\n+\n+All database modules share the same connection pooling concept, and there are 3 possible scenarios for \n+connection pool handling. Please refer `sql:ConnectionPool` for its properties, and possible values. \n+\n+1. Global, shareable default connection pool\n+\n+    If you do not provide the `poolOptions` field when creating the database client, a globally shareable pool will be \n+    created for your database unless a connection pool matching with the properties you provided already exists. \n+    Below shown is the example from JDBC module to use the global connection pool. \n+\n+    ```ballerina\n+    jdbc:Client dbClient = new (\"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb\", \n+                                \"root\", \"root\");\n+    ```\n+\n+2. Client owned, unsharable connection pool\n+\n+    If you define the `connectionPool` field inline when creating the database client with `sql:ConnectionPool` type, \n+    an unshareable connection pool will be created. Below shown is the example from JDBC module to use the global \n+    connection pool.\n+\n+    ```ballerina\n+    jdbc:Client dbClient = new (url = \"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb\", \n+                                connectionPool = { maxOpenConnections: 5 });\n+    ```\n+\n+3. Local shareable connection pool\n+\n+    If you create a record of type `sql:ConnectionPool` and reuse that in the configuration of multiple clients, \n+    for each  set of clients that connects to the same database instance with the same set of properties, a shared \n+    connection pool will be created. Below shown is the example from JDBC module to use the global connection pool.\n+\n+    ```ballerina\n+    sql:ConnectionPool connPool = {maximumPoolSize: 5};\n+    \n+    jdbc:Client dbClient1 = new (url = \"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb\",    \n+                                 connectionPool = connPool);\n+    jdbc:Client dbClient2 = new (url = \"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb\",       \n+                                 connectionPool = connPool);\n+    jdbc:Client dbClient3 = new (url = \"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb\",    \n+                                 connectionPool = connPool);\n+    ```\n+    \n+#### Closing the client\n+\n+Once all database operations are performed you can close the database client you have created by invoking `close()`\n+operation. This will close the corresponding connection pool if it is not shared by any other database clients. \n+\n+```ballerina\n+error? e = dbClient.close();\n+if (e is error){\n+    io:println(\"Error occured:\", e);\n+}\n+\n+```    \n+### Database operations\n+\n+Once the client is created, database operations can be executed through that client. This module defines the interface \n+and common properties that are shared among multiple database clients.

[JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) Module](https://ballerina.io/learn/api-docs/ballerina/java.jdbc/index.html)  \n+This module can be used to connect with any database by simply providing the JDBC URL, and other related properties. \n+Please refer the JDBC module [API docs](https://ballerina.io/learn/api-docs/ballerina/java.jdbc/index.html) for \n+more details.\n+\n+2. [MySQL Module](https://ballerina.io/learn/api-docs/ballerina/mysql/index.html)   \n+This module is specially designed to work with MySQL database, and allows to access the functionality \n+provided by MySQL 8.0.x onwards. Please refer the MySQL module [API docs](https://ballerina.io/learn/api-docs/ballerina/mysql/index.html) \n+for more details.\n+\n+\n+### Client\n+\n+The database client should be created by any of the above listed database modules, and once it is created the \n+below explained operations and functionality can be used. \n+\n+#### Connection pool handling\n+\n+All database modules share the same connection pooling concept, and there are 3 possible scenarios for \n+connection pool handling. Please refer `sql:ConnectionPool` for its properties, and possible values. \n+\n+1. Global, shareable default connection pool\n+\n+    If you do not provide the `poolOptions` field when creating the database client, a globally shareable pool will be \n+    created for your database unless a connection pool matching with the properties you provided already exists. \n+    Below shown is the example from JDBC module to use the global connection pool. \n+\n+    ```ballerina\n+    jdbc:Client dbClient = new (\"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb\", \n+                                \"root\", \"root\");\n+    ```\n+\n+2. Client owned, unsharable connection pool\n+\n+    If you define the `connectionPool` field inline when creating the database client with `sql:ConnectionPool` type, \n+    an unshareable connection pool will be created. Below shown is the example from JDBC module to use the global \n+    connection pool.\n+\n+    ```ballerina\n+    jdbc:Client dbClient = new (url = \"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb\", \n+                                connectionPool = { maxOpenConnections: 5 });\n+    ```\n+\n+3. Local shareable connection pool\n+\n+    If you create a record of type `sql:ConnectionPool` and reuse that in the configuration of multiple clients, \n+    for each  set of clients that connects to the same database instance with the same set of properties, a shared \n+    connection pool will be created. Below shown is the example from JDBC module to use the global connection pool.\n+\n+    ```ballerina\n+    sql:ConnectionPool connPool = {maximumPoolSize: 5};\n+    \n+    jdbc:Client dbClient1 = new (url = \"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb\",    \n+                                 connectionPool = connPool);\n+    jdbc:Client dbClient2 = new (url = \"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb\",       \n+                                 connectionPool = connPool);\n+    jdbc:Client dbClient3 = new (url = \"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb\",    \n+                                 connectionPool = connPool);\n+    ```\n+    \n+#### Closing the client\n+\n+Once all database operations are performed you can close the database client you have created by invoking `close()`\n+operation. This will close the corresponding connection pool if it is not shared by any other database clients. \n+\n+```ballerina\n+error? e = dbClient.close();\n+if (e is error){\n+    io:println(\"Error occured:\", e);\n+}\n+\n+```    \n+### Database operations\n+\n+Once the client is created, database operations can be executed through that client. This module defines the interface \n+and common properties that are shared among multiple database clients.  It also supports querying, inserting, deleting, \n+updating, and batch updating data.  \n+\n+#### Creating tables\n+\n+This sample creates a table with two columns. One column is of type `int`, and the other is of type `varchar`.\n+The CREATE statement is executed via the `execute` remote function of the client.\n+\n+```ballerina\n+// Create the \u2018Students\u2019 table with fields \u2018id\u2019, 'name' and \u2018age\u2019.\n+var ret = dbClient->execute(\"CREATE TABLE student(id INT AUTO_INCREMENT, \" +\n+                         \"age INT, name VARCHAR(255), PRIMARY KEY (id))\");\n+if (ret is sql:ExecutionResult) {\n+    io:println(\"Students table create status in DB: \", ret.affectedRowCount);\n+} else {\n+    error err = ret;\n+    io:println(\"Students table creation failed: \",\n+                <string>err.detail()[\"message\"]);\n+}\n+```\n+\n+#### Inserting data\n+\n+This sample shows three examples of data insertion by executing an INSERT statement using the `execute` remote function \n+of the client.\n+\n+In the first example, query parameter values are passed directly into the query statement of the `execute` \n+remote function.\n+\n+```ballerina\n+var ret = dbClient->execute(\"INSERT INTO student(age, name) \" +\n+                         \"values (23, 'john')\");\n+if (ret is sql:ExecutionResult) {\n+    io:println(\"Inserted row count to Students table: \", ret.affectedRowCount);\n+} else {\n+    error err = ret;\n+    io:println(\"Insert to Students table failed: \",\n+                <string>err.detail()[\"message\"]);\n+}\n+```\n+\n+In the second example, the parameter values, which are in local variables, are used to parameterize the SQL query in \n+`execute` remote function.

Please refer `sql:ConnectionPool` for its properties, and possible values. \n+\n+1. Global, shareable default connection pool\n+\n+    If you do not provide the `poolOptions` field when creating the database client, a globally shareable pool will be \n+    created for your database unless a connection pool matching with the properties you provided already exists. \n+    Below shown is the example from JDBC module to use the global connection pool. \n+\n+    ```ballerina\n+    jdbc:Client dbClient = new (\"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb\", \n+                                \"root\", \"root\");\n+    ```\n+\n+2.

Local shareable connection pool\n+\n+    If you create a record of type `sql:ConnectionPool` and reuse that in the configuration of multiple clients, \n+    for each  set of clients that connects to the same database instance with the same set of properties, a shared \n+    connection pool will be created.

Local shareable connection pool\n+\n+    If you create a record of type `sql:ConnectionPool` and reuse that in the configuration of multiple clients, \n+    for each  set of clients that connects to the same database instance with the same set of properties, a shared \n+    connection pool will be created. Below shown is the example from JDBC module to use the global connection pool.\n+\n+    ```ballerina\n+    sql:ConnectionPool connPool = {maximumPoolSize: 5};\n+    \n+    jdbc:Client dbClient1 = new (url = \"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb\",    \n+                                 connectionPool = connPool);\n+    jdbc:Client dbClient2 = new (url = \"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb\",       \n+                                 connectionPool = connPool);\n+    jdbc:Client dbClient3 = new (url = \"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb\",    \n+                                 connectionPool = connPool);\n+    ```\n+    \n+#### Closing the client\n+\n+Once all database operations are performed you can close the database client you have created by invoking `close()`\n+operation. This will close the corresponding connection pool if it is not shared by any other database clients. \n+\n+```ballerina\n+error? e = dbClient.close();\n+if (e is error){\n+    io:println(\"Error occured:\", e);\n+}\n+\n+```    \n+### Database operations\n+\n+Once the client is created, database operations can be executed through that client.

[JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) Module](https://ballerina.io/learn/api-docs/ballerina/java.jdbc/index.html)  \n+This module can be used to connect with any database by simply providing the JDBC URL, and other related properties. \n+Please refer the JDBC module [API docs](https://ballerina.io/learn/api-docs/ballerina/java.jdbc/index.html) for \n+more details.\n+\n+2. [MySQL Module](https://ballerina.io/learn/api-docs/ballerina/mysql/index.html)   \n+This module is specially designed to work with MySQL database, and allows to access the functionality \n+provided by MySQL 8.0.x onwards. Please refer the MySQL module [API docs](https://ballerina.io/learn/api-docs/ballerina/mysql/index.html) \n+for more details.\n+\n+\n+### Client\n+\n+The database client should be created by any of the above listed database modules, and once it is created the \n+below explained operations and functionality can be used. \n+\n+#### Connection pool handling\n+\n+All database modules share the same connection pooling concept, and there are 3 possible scenarios for \n+connection pool handling. Please refer `sql:ConnectionPool` for its properties, and possible values. \n+\n+1. Global, shareable default connection pool\n+\n+    If you do not provide the `poolOptions` field when creating the database client, a globally shareable pool will be \n+    created for your database unless a connection pool matching with the properties you provided already exists. \n+    Below shown is the example from JDBC module to use the global connection pool. \n+\n+    ```ballerina\n+    jdbc:Client dbClient = new (\"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb\", \n+                                \"root\", \"root\");\n+    ```\n+\n+2. Client owned, unsharable connection pool\n+\n+    If you define the `connectionPool` field inline when creating the database client with `sql:ConnectionPool` type, \n+    an unshareable connection pool will be created. Below shown is the example from JDBC module to use the global \n+    connection pool.\n+\n+    ```ballerina\n+    jdbc:Client dbClient = new (url = \"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb\", \n+                                connectionPool = { maxOpenConnections: 5 });\n+    ```\n+\n+3. Local shareable connection pool\n+\n+    If you create a record of type `sql:ConnectionPool` and reuse that in the configuration of multiple clients, \n+    for each  set of clients that connects to the same database instance with the same set of properties, a shared \n+    connection pool will be created.

Please refer `sql:ConnectionPool` for its properties, and possible values. \n+\n+1. Global, shareable default connection pool\n+\n+    If you do not provide the `poolOptions` field when creating the database client, a globally shareable pool will be \n+    created for your database unless a connection pool matching with the properties you provided already exists. \n+    Below shown is the example from JDBC module to use the global connection pool. \n+\n+    ```ballerina\n+    jdbc:Client dbClient = new (\"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb\", \n+                                \"root\", \"root\");\n+    ```\n+\n+2. Client owned, unsharable connection pool\n+\n+    If you define the `connectionPool` field inline when creating the database client with `sql:ConnectionPool` type, \n+    an unshareable connection pool will be created.

Local shareable connection pool\n+\n+    If you create a record of type `sql:ConnectionPool` and reuse that in the configuration of multiple clients, \n+    for each  set of clients that connects to the same database instance with the same set of properties, a shared \n+    connection pool will be created.

[JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) Module](https://ballerina.io/learn/api-docs/ballerina/java.jdbc/index.html)  \n+This module can be used to connect with any database by simply providing the JDBC URL, and other related properties. \n+Please refer the JDBC module [API docs](https://ballerina.io/learn/api-docs/ballerina/java.jdbc/index.html) for \n+more details.\n+\n+2. [MySQL Module](https://ballerina.io/learn/api-docs/ballerina/mysql/index.html)   \n+This module is specially designed to work with MySQL database, and allows to access the functionality \n+provided by MySQL 8.0.x onwards. Please refer the MySQL module [API docs](https://ballerina.io/learn/api-docs/ballerina/mysql/index.html) \n+for more details.\n+\n+\n+### Client\n+\n+The database client should be created by any of the above listed database modules, and once it is created the \n+below explained operations and functionality can be used. \n+\n+#### Connection pool handling\n+\n+All database modules share the same connection pooling concept, and there are 3 possible scenarios for \n+connection pool handling. Please refer `sql:ConnectionPool` for its properties, and possible values. \n+\n+1. Global, shareable default connection pool\n+\n+    If you do not provide the `poolOptions` field when creating the database client, a globally shareable pool will be \n+    created for your database unless a connection pool matching with the properties you provided already exists. \n+    Below shown is the example from JDBC module to use the global connection pool. \n+\n+    ```ballerina\n+    jdbc:Client dbClient = new (\"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb\", \n+                                \"root\", \"root\");\n+    ```\n+\n+2. Client owned, unsharable connection pool\n+\n+    If you define the `connectionPool` field inline when creating the database client with `sql:ConnectionPool` type, \n+    an unshareable connection pool will be created. Below shown is the example from JDBC module to use the global \n+    connection pool.\n+\n+    ```ballerina\n+    jdbc:Client dbClient = new (url = \"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb\", \n+                                connectionPool = { maxOpenConnections: 5 });\n+    ```\n+\n+3. Local shareable connection pool\n+\n+    If you create a record of type `sql:ConnectionPool` and reuse that in the configuration of multiple clients, \n+    for each  set of clients that connects to the same database instance with the same set of properties, a shared \n+    connection pool will be created. Below shown is the example from JDBC module to use the global connection pool.\n+\n+    ```ballerina\n+    sql:ConnectionPool connPool = {maximumPoolSize: 5};\n+    \n+    jdbc:Client dbClient1 = new (url = \"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb\",    \n+                                 connectionPool = connPool);\n+    jdbc:Client dbClient2 = new (url = \"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb\",       \n+                                 connectionPool = connPool);\n+    jdbc:Client dbClient3 = new (url = \"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb\",    \n+                                 connectionPool = connPool);\n+    ```\n+    \n+#### Closing the client\n+\n+Once all database operations are performed you can close the database client you have created by invoking `close()`\n+operation. This will close the corresponding connection pool if it is not shared by any other database clients. \n+\n+```ballerina\n+error? e = dbClient.close();\n+if (e is error){\n+    io:println(\"Error occured:\", e);\n+}\n+\n+```    \n+### Database operations\n+\n+Once the client is created, database operations can be executed through that client.

This type of parameterized SQL query can be used with any primitive Ballerina type \n+like `string`, `int`, `float`, or `boolean`, and in that case, the corresponding SQL type of the parameter is derived \n+from the type of the Ballerina variable that is passed in. \n+\n+```ballerina\n+string name = \"Anne\";\n+int age = 8;\n+\n+var ret = dbClient->execute(`INSERT INTO student(age, name) \n+                             values (${age}, ${name})`);\n+if (ret is sql:ExecutionResult) {\n+    io:println(\"Inserted row count to Students table: \", ret.affectedRowCount);\n+} else {\n+    error err = ret;\n+    io:println(\"Insert to Students table failed: \",\n+                <string>err.detail()[\"message\"]);\n+}\n+```\n+\n+In the third example, parameter values are passed as a `sql:TypedValue` to the `execute` remote function.

Next, the SELECT query is executed via the `query` remote function of the client by passing that \n+result set type. Once the query is executed, each data record can be retrieved by looping the result set.

Please refer `sql:ConnectionPool` for its properties, and possible values. \n+\n+1. Global, shareable default connection pool\n+\n+    If you do not provide the `poolOptions` field when creating the database client, a globally shareable pool will be \n+    created for your database unless a connection pool matching with the properties you provided already exists. \n+    Below shown is the example from JDBC module to use the global connection pool. \n+\n+    ```ballerina\n+    jdbc:Client dbClient = new (\"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb\", \n+                                \"root\", \"root\");\n+    ```\n+\n+2.

The corresponding database\n+clients can be created by using specific database modules such as `MySQL` or using Java Database Connectivity \n+module `JDBC`. The available database modules are listed below.\n+\n+### List of Database Modules\n+1. [JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) Module](https://ballerina.io/learn/api-docs/ballerina/java.jdbc/index.html)  \n+This module can be used to connect with any database by simply providing the JDBC URL, and other related properties. \n+Please refer the JDBC module [API docs](https://ballerina.io/learn/api-docs/ballerina/java.jdbc/index.html) for \n+more details.\n+\n+2. [MySQL Module](https://ballerina.io/learn/api-docs/ballerina/mysql/index.html)   \n+This module is specially designed to work with MySQL database, and allows to access the functionality \n+provided by MySQL 8.0.x onwards. Please refer the MySQL module [API docs](https://ballerina.io/learn/api-docs/ballerina/mysql/index.html) \n+for more details.\n+\n+\n+### Client\n+\n+The database client should be created by any of the above listed database modules, and once it is created the \n+below explained operations and functionality can be used. \n+\n+#### Connection pool handling\n+\n+All database modules share the same connection pooling concept, and there are 3 possible scenarios for \n+connection pool handling. Please refer `sql:ConnectionPool` for its properties, and possible values. \n+\n+1. Global, shareable default connection pool\n+\n+    If you do not provide the `poolOptions` field when creating the database client, a globally shareable pool will be \n+    created for your database unless a connection pool matching with the properties you provided already exists. \n+    Below shown is the example from JDBC module to use the global connection pool. \n+\n+    ```ballerina\n+    jdbc:Client dbClient = new (\"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb\", \n+                                \"root\", \"root\");\n+    ```\n+\n+2. Client owned, unsharable connection pool\n+\n+    If you define the `connectionPool` field inline when creating the database client with `sql:ConnectionPool` type, \n+    an unshareable connection pool will be created. Below shown is the example from JDBC module to use the global \n+    connection pool.\n+\n+    ```ballerina\n+    jdbc:Client dbClient = new (url = \"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb\", \n+                                connectionPool = { maxOpenConnections: 5 });\n+    ```\n+\n+3. Local shareable connection pool\n+\n+    If you create a record of type `sql:ConnectionPool` and reuse that in the configuration of multiple clients, \n+    for each  set of clients that connects to the same database instance with the same set of properties, a shared \n+    connection pool will be created. Below shown is the example from JDBC module to use the global connection pool.\n+\n+    ```ballerina\n+    sql:ConnectionPool connPool = {maximumPoolSize: 5};\n+    \n+    jdbc:Client dbClient1 = new (url = \"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb\",    \n+                                 connectionPool = connPool);\n+    jdbc:Client dbClient2 = new (url = \"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb\",       \n+                                 connectionPool = connPool);\n+    jdbc:Client dbClient3 = new (url = \"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb\",    \n+                                 connectionPool = connPool);\n+    ```\n+    \n+#### Closing the client\n+\n+Once all database operations are performed you can close the database client you have created by invoking `close()`\n+operation. This will close the corresponding connection pool if it is not shared by any other database clients. \n+\n+```ballerina\n+error? e = dbClient.close();\n+if (e is error){\n+    io:println(\"Error occured:\", e);\n+}\n+\n+```    \n+### Database operations\n+\n+Once the client is created, database operations can be executed through that client.

[JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) Module](https://ballerina.io/learn/api-docs/ballerina/java.jdbc/index.html)  \n+This module can be used to connect with any database by simply providing the JDBC URL, and other related properties. \n+Please refer the JDBC module [API docs](https://ballerina.io/learn/api-docs/ballerina/java.jdbc/index.html) for \n+more details.\n+\n+2. [MySQL Module](https://ballerina.io/learn/api-docs/ballerina/mysql/index.html)   \n+This module is specially designed to work with MySQL database, and allows to access the functionality \n+provided by MySQL 8.0.x onwards. Please refer the MySQL module [API docs](https://ballerina.io/learn/api-docs/ballerina/mysql/index.html) \n+for more details.\n+\n+\n+### Client\n+\n+The database client should be created by any of the above listed database modules, and once it is created the \n+below explained operations and functionality can be used. \n+\n+#### Connection pool handling\n+\n+All database modules share the same connection pooling concept, and there are 3 possible scenarios for \n+connection pool handling. Please refer `sql:ConnectionPool` for its properties, and possible values. \n+\n+1. Global, shareable default connection pool\n+\n+    If you do not provide the `poolOptions` field when creating the database client, a globally shareable pool will be \n+    created for your database unless a connection pool matching with the properties you provided already exists. \n+    Below shown is the example from JDBC module to use the global connection pool. \n+\n+    ```ballerina\n+    jdbc:Client dbClient = new (\"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb\", \n+                                \"root\", \"root\");\n+    ```\n+\n+2. Client owned, unsharable connection pool\n+\n+    If you define the `connectionPool` field inline when creating the database client with `sql:ConnectionPool` type, \n+    an unshareable connection pool will be created. Below shown is the example from JDBC module to use the global \n+    connection pool.\n+\n+    ```ballerina\n+    jdbc:Client dbClient = new (url = \"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb\", \n+                                connectionPool = { maxOpenConnections: 5 });\n+    ```\n+\n+3. Local shareable connection pool\n+\n+    If you create a record of type `sql:ConnectionPool` and reuse that in the configuration of multiple clients, \n+    for each  set of clients that connects to the same database instance with the same set of properties, a shared \n+    connection pool will be created. Below shown is the example from JDBC module to use the global connection pool.\n+\n+    ```ballerina\n+    sql:ConnectionPool connPool = {maximumPoolSize: 5};\n+    \n+    jdbc:Client dbClient1 = new (url = \"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb\",    \n+                                 connectionPool = connPool);\n+    jdbc:Client dbClient2 = new (url = \"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb\",       \n+                                 connectionPool = connPool);\n+    jdbc:Client dbClient3 = new (url = \"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb\",    \n+                                 connectionPool = connPool);\n+    ```\n+    \n+#### Closing the client\n+\n+Once all database operations are performed you can close the database client you have created by invoking `close()`\n+operation. This will close the corresponding connection pool if it is not shared by any other database clients. \n+\n+```ballerina\n+error? e = dbClient.close();\n+if (e is error){\n+    io:println(\"Error occured:\", e);\n+}\n+\n+```    \n+### Database operations\n+\n+Once the client is created, database operations can be executed through that client. This module defines the interface \n+and common properties that are shared among multiple database clients.  It also supports querying, inserting, deleting, \n+updating, and batch updating data.  \n+\n+#### Creating tables\n+\n+This sample creates a table with two columns. One column is of type `int`, and the other is of type `varchar`.\n+The CREATE statement is executed via the `execute` remote function of the client.\n+\n+```ballerina\n+// Create the \u2018Students\u2019 table with fields \u2018id\u2019, 'name' and \u2018age\u2019.\n+var ret = dbClient->execute(\"CREATE TABLE student(id INT AUTO_INCREMENT, \" +\n+                         \"age INT, name VARCHAR(255), PRIMARY KEY (id))\");\n+if (ret is sql:ExecutionResult) {\n+    io:println(\"Students table create status in DB: \", ret.affectedRowCount);\n+} else {\n+    error err = ret;\n+    io:println(\"Students table creation failed: \",\n+                <string>err.detail()[\"message\"]);\n+}\n+```\n+\n+#### Inserting data\n+\n+This sample shows three examples of data insertion by executing an INSERT statement using the `execute` remote function \n+of the client.\n+\n+In the first example, query parameter values are passed directly into the query statement of the `execute` \n+remote function.\n+\n+```ballerina\n+var ret = dbClient->execute(\"INSERT INTO student(age, name) \" +\n+                         \"values (23, 'john')\");\n+if (ret is sql:ExecutionResult) {\n+    io:println(\"Inserted row count to Students table: \", ret.affectedRowCount);\n+} else {\n+    error err = ret;\n+    io:println(\"Insert to Students table failed: \",\n+                <string>err.detail()[\"message\"]);\n+}\n+```\n+\n+In the second example, the parameter values, which are in local variables, are used to parameterize the SQL query in \n+`execute` remote function. This type of parameterized SQL query can be used with any primitive Ballerina type \n+like `string`, `int`, `float`, or `boolean`, and in that case, the corresponding SQL type of the parameter is derived \n+from the type of the Ballerina variable that is passed in. \n+\n+```ballerina\n+string name = \"Anne\";\n+int age = 8;\n+\n+var ret = dbClient->execute(`INSERT INTO student(age, name) \n+                             values (${age}, ${name})`);\n+if (ret is sql:ExecutionResult) {\n+    io:println(\"Inserted row count to Students table: \", ret.affectedRowCount);\n+} else {\n+    error err = ret;\n+    io:println(\"Insert to Students table failed: \",\n+                <string>err.detail()[\"message\"]);\n+}\n+```\n+\n+In the third example, parameter values are passed as a `sql:TypedValue` to the `execute` remote function.

Please note the mapping of the database column \n+to the returned record's property is case insensitive (i.e., `ID` column in result, can be mapped to `id` \n+property in record). Next, the SELECT query is executed via the `query` remote function of the client by passing that \n+result set type. Once the query is executed, each data record can be retrieved by looping the result set. The `stream` \n+returned by the select operation holds a pointer to the actual data in the database and it loads data from the table \n+only when it is accessed. This stream can be iterated only once. \n+\n+```ballerina\n+// Define a type to represent the results.\n+type Student record {\n+    int id;\n+    int age;\n+    string name;\n+};\n+\n+// Select the data from the database table.

This type of parameterized SQL query can be used with any primitive Ballerina type \n+like `string`, `int`, `float`, or `boolean`, and in that case, the corresponding SQL type of the parameter is derived \n+from the type of the Ballerina variable that is passed in. \n+\n+```ballerina\n+string name = \"Anne\";\n+int age = 8;\n+\n+var ret = dbClient->execute(`INSERT INTO student(age, name) \n+                             values (${age}, ${name})`);\n+if (ret is sql:ExecutionResult) {\n+    io:println(\"Inserted row count to Students table: \", ret.affectedRowCount);\n+} else {\n+    error err = ret;\n+    io:println(\"Insert to Students table failed: \",\n+                <string>err.detail()[\"message\"]);\n+}\n+```\n+\n+In the third example, parameter values are passed as a `sql:TypedValue` to the `execute` remote function. Use \n+corresponding subtype of `sql:TypedValue` such as `sql:Varchar`, `sql:Char`, `sql:Integer`, etc when you need to \n+provide more details such as the exact SQL type of the parameter.\n+\n+```ballerina\n+sql:Varchar name = new (\"James\");\n+sql:Integer age = new (10);\n+\n+var ret = dbClient->execute(`INSERT INTO student(age, name) \n+                             values (${age}, ${name})`);\n+if (ret is sql:ExecutionResult) {\n+    io:println(\"Inserted row count to Students table: \", ret.affectedRowCount);\n+} else {\n+    error err = ret;\n+    io:println(\"Insert to Students table failed: \",\n+                <string>err.detail()[\"message\"]);\n+}\n+```\n+\n+#### Inserting data with auto-generated keys\n+\n+This example demonstrates inserting data while returning the auto-generated keys. It achieves this by using the \n+`execute` remote function to execute the INSERT statement.\n+\n+```ballerina\n+int age = 31;\n+string name = \"Kate\";\n+var ret = dbClient->execute(`INSERT INTO student(age, name) \n+                             values (${age}, ${name})`);\n+if (ret is sql:ExecutionResult) {\n+    int? count = ret.affectedRowCount;\n+    string|int? generatedKey = ret.lastInsertId;\n+    io:println(\"Inserted row count: \", count);\n+    io:println(\"Generated key: \", generatedKey);\n+} else {\n+    error err = ret;\n+    io:println(\"Insert to table failed: \", <string>err.detail()[\"message\"]);\n+}\n+```\n+\n+#### Querying data\n+\n+This sample shows three examples to demonstrate the different usages of the `query` operation and query the\n+database table and obtain the results. \n+\n+This example demonstrates querying data from a table in a database. \n+First, a type is created to represent the returned result set. Please note the mapping of the database column \n+to the returned record's property is case insensitive (i.e., `ID` column in result, can be mapped to `id` \n+property in record). Next, the SELECT query is executed via the `query` remote function of the client by passing that \n+result set type. Once the query is executed, each data record can be retrieved by looping the result set. The `stream` \n+returned by the select operation holds a pointer to the actual data in the database and it loads data from the table \n+only when it is accessed. This stream can be iterated only once. \n+\n+```ballerina\n+// Define a type to represent the results.\n+type Student record {\n+    int id;\n+    int age;\n+    string name;\n+};\n+\n+// Select the data from the database table. Query Parameters are passed directly. \n+// Similar to `execute` examples, parameters can be passed as sub types of \n+// `sql:TypedValue`s as well.\n+int id = 10;\n+int age = 12;\n+stream<Student, sql:Error> resultStream = dbClient->query(`SELECT * FROM students \n+                                                          WHERE id < ${id} AND \n+                                                          age > ${age}`, Student);\n+\n+// Iterating returned table.\n+error? e = resultStream.forEach(function(Student student) {\n+   io:println(\"Student Id: \", student.id);\n+   io:println(\"Student age: \", student.age);\n+   io:println(\"Student name: \", student.name);\n+});\n+if (e is error) {\n+   io:println(\"Query execution failed.\", e);\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Defining the return type is optional, and you can query the database without providing the result type. And hence \n+the above example can be modified as below with open record type as return type. The property name in the open record \n+type will be same as how the column is defined in the database. \n+\n+```ballerina\n+// Select the data from the database table. Query Parameters are passed directly. \n+// Similar to `execute` examples, parameters can be passed as sub types of \n+// `sql:TypedValue`s as well.\n+int id = 10;\n+int age = 12;\n+stream<record{}, sql:Error> resultStream = dbClient->query(`SELECT * FROM students \n+                                                            WHERE id < ${id} AND \n+                                                            age > ${age}`, Student);\n+\n+// Iterating returned table.\n+error? e = resultStream.forEach(function(record{} student) {\n+   io:println(\"Student Id: \", student[\"id\"]);\n+   io:println(\"Student age: \", student[\"age\"]);\n+   io:println(\"Student name: \", student[\"name\"];\n+});\n+if (e is error) {\n+   io:println(\"Query execution failed.\", e);\n+}\n+```\n+\n+There are situations where you may do not want to iterate through the database, and in that case you may decide\n+to only use the `next()` operation in the result `stream` and retrieve the first record. In such cases, the returned\n+result stream will not be closed, and you have to explicitly invoke `close` operation on the \n+`sql:Client` to release the connection resources and avoid connection leak as shown below.\n+\n+```ballerina\n+stream<record{}, sql:Error> resultStream = dbClient->query(\"SELECT count(*) as \" + \n+                                                           \"total FROM students\");\n+\n+record {|record {} value;|}|error? result = resultStream.next();\n+\n+if (result is record {|record {} value;|}) {\n+    io:println(\"Total students : \", result.value[\"total\"]);\n+} else if (result is error) {\n+    io:println(\"Error encoutered when executing query. \", result);\n+} else {\n+    io:println(\"Student table is empty\");\n+}\n+\n+error? e = resultStream.close();\n+if(e is error){\n+    io:println(\"Error when closing the stream\", e);\n+}\n+```\n+\n+#### Updating data\n+\n+This example demonstrates modifying data by executing an UPDATE statement via the `execute` remote function of \n+the client.\n+\n+```ballerina\n+int age = 23;\n+var ret = dbClient->execute(`UPDATE students SET name = 'John' WHERE age = ${age}`);\n+if (ret is sql:ExecutionResult) {\n+    io:println(\"Updated row count in Students table: \", ret.affectedRowCount);\n+} else {\n+    error err = ret;\n+    io:println(\"Update to students table failed: \",\n+                <string>err.detail()[\"message\"]);\n+}\n+```\n+\n+#### Deleting data\n+\n+This example demonstrates deleting data by executing an DELETE statement via the `execute` remote function of \n+the client.\n+\n+```ballerina\n+string name = \"John\";\n+var ret = dbClient->execute(`DELETE from students WHERE name = ${name}`);\n+if (ret is sql:ExecutionResult) {\n+    io:println(\"Deleted student count: \", ret.affectedRowCount);\n+} else {\n+    error err = ret;\n+    io:println(\"Delete from students table failed: \",\n+                <string>err.detail()[\"message\"]);\n+}\n+```\n+\n+#### Batch updating data\n+\n+This example demonstrates how to insert multiple records with a single INSERT statement that is executed via the \n+`batchExecute` remote function of the client. This is done by creating a `table` with multiple records and \n+parameterizing the SQL query as same as `execute` operations above.  \n+\n+```ballerina\n+// Create the table with records that needs to be inserted.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "b0bb10d4debd0aa76290e8b7fbd275fee2ce4aa3"}, "originalPosition": 316}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzOTU2OTYyOQ==", "bodyText": "Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n                # + return - Summary of the sql update query as `ExecutionResult`, or `Error`\n          \n          \n            \n                # + return - Summary of the sql update query as `ExecutionResult` or an `Error`", "url": "https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang/pull/24037#discussion_r439569629", "createdAt": "2020-06-12T18:06:50Z", "author": {"login": "praneesha"}, "path": "stdlib/database/sql/src/main/ballerina/src/sql/client.bal", "diffHunk": "@@ -28,15 +28,15 @@ public type Client abstract client object {\n     #             column names of the query result set be used for the record attributes\n     # + return - Stream of records in the type of `rowType`\n     public remote function query(@untainted string|ParameterizedString sqlQuery, typedesc<record {}>? rowType = ())\n-    returns @tainted stream<record{}, Error>;\n+    returns @tainted stream <record {}, Error>;\n \n     # Executes the DDL or DML sql query provided by the user, and returns summary of the execution.\n     #\n     # + sqlQuery - The DDL or DML query such as INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, etc as `string` or `ParameterizedString`\n     #              when the query has params to be passed in\n-    # + return - Summary of the sql update query as `ExecutionResult` or returns `Error`\n+    # + return - Summary of the sql update query as `ExecutionResult`, or `Error`", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "b0bb10d4debd0aa76290e8b7fbd275fee2ce4aa3"}, "originalPosition": 12}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "bf8f012f3f3e0212f36b44397e66cec7cacfe775", "author": {"user": {"login": "sinthuja", "name": null}}, "url": "https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang/commit/bf8f012f3f3e0212f36b44397e66cec7cacfe775", "committedDate": "2020-06-12T18:54:49Z", "message": "Fix failing testcases based on the latest transaction fixes"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "8d83edd04c02621b84629eb75d70081abb2ddd50", "author": {"user": {"login": "sinthuja", "name": null}}, "url": "https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang/commit/8d83edd04c02621b84629eb75d70081abb2ddd50", "committedDate": "2020-06-12T18:58:03Z", "message": "Apply suggestions from code review\n\nCo-authored-by: praneesha <praneesha@wso2.com>"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDMwMTE1Nzc0", "url": "https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang/pull/24037#pullrequestreview-430115774", "createdAt": "2020-06-13T05:36:01Z", "commit": {"oid": "8d83edd04c02621b84629eb75d70081abb2ddd50"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNi0xM1QwNTozNjowMVrOGjV3NQ==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNi0xM1QwNTo0NTo1MlrOGjV5IQ==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzOTcxMTU0MQ==", "bodyText": "Shall we point to the BBE?
