You can download one from one of the following locations:\n-\n-* [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)\n-* [http://openjdk.java.net/install/index.html](http://openjdk.java.net/install/index.html)\n-\n-> NOTE: Set an environment variable `JAVA_HOME` to the path name of the directory into which you installed the JDK release.\n-\n-**Prerequisite 2** - Node (v8.9.x or latest LTS release) + npm (v5.6.0 or later)\n-\n-**Prerequisite 3** - Docker \n-\n-#### Building from the source\n-\n-Clone this repository using the following command.\n-\n-```\n-git clone --recursive https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang.git\n-```\n-\n-If you have forked the repository to your github account then use the following command replacing <YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME> with your git username.\n-\n-````\n-git clone --recursive https://github.com/<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>/ballerina-lang.git\n-````\n-\n-If you download the sources, you need to update the git submodules using the following command.\n-\n-```\n-git submodule update --init \n-```\n-\n-Run the gradle command `./gradlew clean build` from the Ballerina root directory:\n-\n-Extract the Ballerina distribution created at `distribution/zip/ballerina/target/ballerina-<version>-SNAPSHOT.zip`. The `zip/ballerina` directory contains the runtime only. `zip/ballerina-tools/` contains the runtime and tools (e.g., Ballerina Composer).\n-\n-Note: It is possible to face an IOException error stating \"Too many open files\". This is due to the default number of possible open files being set to a lower number on your operating system than required for Ballerina to be compiled. You may have to increase the number of open files/file descriptors (FD) on your operating system. This is OS dependent and you can search the internet on how to do this for your operating system (Windows/OSX/Linux).

You can download one from one of the following locations:\n-\n-* [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)\n-* [http://openjdk.java.net/install/index.html](http://openjdk.java.net/install/index.html)\n-\n-> NOTE: Set an environment variable `JAVA_HOME` to the path name of the directory into which you installed the JDK release.\n-\n-**Prerequisite 2** - Node (v8.9.x or latest LTS release) + npm (v5.6.0 or later)\n-\n-**Prerequisite 3** - Docker \n-\n-#### Building from the source\n-\n-Clone this repository using the following command.\n-\n-```\n-git clone --recursive https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang.git\n-```\n-\n-If you have forked the repository to your github account then use the following command replacing <YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME> with your git username.\n-\n-````\n-git clone --recursive https://github.com/<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>/ballerina-lang.git\n-````\n-\n-If you download the sources, you need to update the git submodules using the following command.\n-\n-```\n-git submodule update --init \n-```\n-\n-Run the gradle command `./gradlew clean build` from the Ballerina root directory:\n-\n-Extract the Ballerina distribution created at `distribution/zip/ballerina/target/ballerina-<version>-SNAPSHOT.zip`. The `zip/ballerina` directory contains the runtime only. `zip/ballerina-tools/` contains the runtime and tools (e.g., Ballerina Composer).\n-\n-Note: It is possible to face an IOException error stating \"Too many open files\". This is due to the default number of possible open files being set to a lower number on your operating system than required for Ballerina to be compiled. You may have to increase the number of open files/file descriptors (FD) on your operating system. This is OS dependent and you can search the internet on how to do this for your operating system (Windows/OSX/Linux). You could update the maximum number of open files to 1000000 (or higher).\n-\n-### Setting up your development environment\n-\n-#### Setup IntelliJ IDEA\n-\n-##### Importing a Ballerina Project\n+- [Get started](#get-started)\n+- [Set up the Prerequisites](#set-up-the-prerequisites)\n+- [Obtain the source code](#obtain-the-source-code)\n+- [Build the project](#build-the-project)\n+- [Set up the development environment](#set-up-the-development-environment)\n+    - [Set up the Ballerina plugin](#set-up-the-ballerina-plugin)\n+    - [Set up the ANTLR4 plugin](#set-up-the-antlr4-plugin)\n+- [Submit your contribution](#submit-your-contribution)\n+- [Accept the Contributor License Agreement](#accept-the-contributor-license-agreement)\n+- [Propose changes to Ballerina](#propose-changes-to-ballerina)\n \n-Import the Ballerina project to IntelliJ IDEA similar to any other Gradle project. \n+## Get started\n \n-* Navigate to `File | Open` menu.\n-* Browse the filesystem and Select Ballerina Project's root directory.\n-   * If prompted to import Gradle project select `Auto import`.\n-   * Set Project SDK as Java 1.8\n+- Join the conversations at:\n \n-##### Useful IDEA Plugins\n+    - [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ballerina): to get help with Ballerina (use the Ballerina tag for any of your questions.)\n+    - [Slack](https://ballerinalang.slack.com/): for real-time discussions with the team and community\n+    - [Ballerina-Dev Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ballerina-dev): (developer team mailing list) to discuss Ballerina roadmap, features, and related issues\n+    - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ballerinalang): to tweet about Ballerina (use the \u201c#ballerinalang\u201d hashtag). \n \n-* ANTLR 4 - https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7358-antlr-v4-grammar-plugin \n-* Ballerina - https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9520-ballerina (Need IDEA 2016.3 or newer)\n+- Submitting a bug is just as important as contributing to code.

You can download one from one of the following locations:\n-\n-* [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)\n-* [http://openjdk.java.net/install/index.html](http://openjdk.java.net/install/index.html)\n-\n-> NOTE: Set an environment variable `JAVA_HOME` to the path name of the directory into which you installed the JDK release.\n-\n-**Prerequisite 2** - Node (v8.9.x or latest LTS release) + npm (v5.6.0 or later)\n-\n-**Prerequisite 3** - Docker \n-\n-#### Building from the source\n-\n-Clone this repository using the following command.\n-\n-```\n-git clone --recursive https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang.git\n-```\n-\n-If you have forked the repository to your github account then use the following command replacing <YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME> with your git username.\n-\n-````\n-git clone --recursive https://github.com/<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>/ballerina-lang.git\n-````\n-\n-If you download the sources, you need to update the git submodules using the following command.\n-\n-```\n-git submodule update --init \n-```\n-\n-Run the gradle command `./gradlew clean build` from the Ballerina root directory:\n-\n-Extract the Ballerina distribution created at `distribution/zip/ballerina/target/ballerina-<version>-SNAPSHOT.zip`. The `zip/ballerina` directory contains the runtime only. `zip/ballerina-tools/` contains the runtime and tools (e.g., Ballerina Composer).\n-\n-Note: It is possible to face an IOException error stating \"Too many open files\". This is due to the default number of possible open files being set to a lower number on your operating system than required for Ballerina to be compiled. You may have to increase the number of open files/file descriptors (FD) on your operating system. This is OS dependent and you can search the internet on how to do this for your operating system (Windows/OSX/Linux). You could update the maximum number of open files to 1000000 (or higher).\n-\n-### Setting up your development environment\n-\n-#### Setup IntelliJ IDEA\n-\n-##### Importing a Ballerina Project\n+- [Get started](#get-started)\n+- [Set up the Prerequisites](#set-up-the-prerequisites)\n+- [Obtain the source code](#obtain-the-source-code)\n+- [Build the project](#build-the-project)\n+- [Set up the development environment](#set-up-the-development-environment)\n+    - [Set up the Ballerina plugin](#set-up-the-ballerina-plugin)\n+    - [Set up the ANTLR4 plugin](#set-up-the-antlr4-plugin)\n+- [Submit your contribution](#submit-your-contribution)\n+- [Accept the Contributor License Agreement](#accept-the-contributor-license-agreement)\n+- [Propose changes to Ballerina](#propose-changes-to-ballerina)\n \n-Import the Ballerina project to IntelliJ IDEA similar to any other Gradle project. \n+## Get started\n \n-* Navigate to `File | Open` menu.\n-* Browse the filesystem and Select Ballerina Project's root directory.\n-   * If prompted to import Gradle project select `Auto import`.\n-   * Set Project SDK as Java 1.8\n+- Join the conversations at:\n \n-##### Useful IDEA Plugins\n+    - [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ballerina): to get help with Ballerina (use the Ballerina tag for any of your questions.)\n+    - [Slack](https://ballerinalang.slack.com/): for real-time discussions with the team and community\n+    - [Ballerina-Dev Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ballerina-dev): (developer team mailing list) to discuss Ballerina roadmap, features, and related issues\n+    - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ballerinalang): to tweet about Ballerina (use the \u201c#ballerinalang\u201d hashtag). \n \n-* ANTLR 4 - https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7358-antlr-v4-grammar-plugin \n-* Ballerina - https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9520-ballerina (Need IDEA 2016.3 or newer)\n+- Submitting a bug is just as important as contributing to code.

High level grammar productions/abstractions are defined in the parser using those tokens.\n \n-#### Generating Parsers\n+    Once a change is done to any of the grammar files, the lexer and the parser need to be re-generated. To generate the lexer and the parser, navigate to the `<BALLERINA_PROJECT_ROOT>/compiler/ballerina-lang/src/main/resources/grammar/` directory, and execute the below command. \n \n-Once a change is done to any of the grammar files, the lexer and the parser need to be re-generated. To generate the lexer and the parser, first download the `antlr-complete-4.5.3.jar` file. Then navigate to `<ballerina>/compiler/ballerina-lang/src/main/resources/grammar/`, and execute the following command:\n-```\n-java -jar <path-to-antlr-jar>/antlr-4.5.3-complete.jar *.g4 -package org.wso2.ballerinalang.compiler.parser.antlr4 -o ../../java/org/wso2/ballerinalang/compiler/parser/antlr4/\n-```\n+    >**Tip:** Download the [antlr-complete-4.5.3.jar](https://jar-download.com/artifacts/org.antlr/antlr4/4.5.3/source-code) file and replace `<PATH-TO-ANTLR-JAR>` in the below command with the location in which you saved it.\n \n-The above command will autogenerate some Java classes. Out of the autogenerated classes, `BallerinaParserBaseListener.java` in particular is important, as the Ballerina AST builder is written on top of it. Thus, if any new rules are added to the BallerinaParser.g4, above command will generate new methods in the `BallerinaParserBaseListener.java`, and you need to override those newly added methods inside `BLangParserListener.java` accordingly.\n+    ```bash \n+    java -jar <PATH-TO-ANTLR-JAR>/antlr-4.5.3-complete.jar *.g4 -package org.wso2.ballerinalang.compiler.parser.antlr4 -o <BALLERINA_PROJECT_ROOT>/compiler/ballerina-lang/src/main/java/org/wso2/ballerinalang/compiler/parser/antlr4/\n+    ```\n \n-### Ballerina Compiler \n-https://medium.com/@sameera.jayasoma/ballerina-compiler-design-3406acc2476c\n+    **Info:** The above command will autogenerate some Java classes.

You can download one from one of the following locations:\n-\n-* [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)\n-* [http://openjdk.java.net/install/index.html](http://openjdk.java.net/install/index.html)\n-\n-> NOTE: Set an environment variable `JAVA_HOME` to the path name of the directory into which you installed the JDK release.\n-\n-**Prerequisite 2** - Node (v8.9.x or latest LTS release) + npm (v5.6.0 or later)\n-\n-**Prerequisite 3** - Docker \n-\n-#### Building from the source\n-\n-Clone this repository using the following command.\n-\n-```\n-git clone --recursive https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang.git\n-```\n-\n-If you have forked the repository to your github account then use the following command replacing <YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME> with your git username.\n-\n-````\n-git clone --recursive https://github.com/<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>/ballerina-lang.git\n-````\n-\n-If you download the sources, you need to update the git submodules using the following command.\n-\n-```\n-git submodule update --init \n-```\n-\n-Run the gradle command `./gradlew clean build` from the Ballerina root directory:\n-\n-Extract the Ballerina distribution created at `distribution/zip/ballerina/target/ballerina-<version>-SNAPSHOT.zip`. The `zip/ballerina` directory contains the runtime only. `zip/ballerina-tools/` contains the runtime and tools (e.g., Ballerina Composer).\n-\n-Note: It is possible to face an IOException error stating \"Too many open files\". This is due to the default number of possible open files being set to a lower number on your operating system than required for Ballerina to be compiled. You may have to increase the number of open files/file descriptors (FD) on your operating system. This is OS dependent and you can search the internet on how to do this for your operating system (Windows/OSX/Linux). You could update the maximum number of open files to 1000000 (or higher).\n-\n-### Setting up your development environment\n-\n-#### Setup IntelliJ IDEA\n+- [Get started](#get-started)\n+- [Set up the Prerequisites](#set-up-the-prerequisites)\n+- [Obtain the source code](#obtain-the-source-code)\n+- [Build the project](#build-the-project)\n+- [Set up the development environment](#set-up-the-development-environment)\n+    - [Set up the Ballerina plugin](#set-up-the-ballerina-plugin)\n+    - [Set up the ANTLR4 plugin](#set-up-the-antlr4-plugin)\n+- [Submit your contribution](#submit-your-contribution)\n+- [Accept the Contributor License Agreement](#accept-the-contributor-license-agreement)\n+- [Propose changes to Ballerina](#propose-changes-to-ballerina)\n \n-##### Importing a Ballerina Project\n+## Get started\n \n-Import the Ballerina project to IntelliJ IDEA similar to any other Gradle project. \n+- Join the conversations at:\n \n-* Navigate to `File | Open` menu.\n-* Browse the filesystem and Select Ballerina Project's root directory.\n-   * If prompted to import Gradle project select `Auto import`.\n-   * Set Project SDK as Java 1.8\n+    - [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ballerina): to get help with Ballerina (use the Ballerina tag for any of your questions)\n+    - [Slack](https://ballerina.io/community/slack/): for real-time discussions with the team and community\n+    - [Ballerina-Dev Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ballerina-dev): (developer team mailing list) to discuss Ballerina roadmap, features, and related issues\n+    - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ballerinalang): to tweet about Ballerina (use the \u201c#ballerinalang\u201d hashtag) \n \n-##### Useful IDEA Plugins\n+- Submitting a bug is just as important as contributing to code.

You can download one from one of the following locations:\n-\n-* [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)\n-* [http://openjdk.java.net/install/index.html](http://openjdk.java.net/install/index.html)\n-\n-> NOTE: Set an environment variable `JAVA_HOME` to the path name of the directory into which you installed the JDK release.\n-\n-**Prerequisite 2** - Node (v8.9.x or latest LTS release) + npm (v5.6.0 or later)\n-\n-**Prerequisite 3** - Docker \n-\n-#### Building from the source\n-\n-Clone this repository using the following command.\n-\n-```\n-git clone --recursive https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang.git\n-```\n-\n-If you have forked the repository to your github account then use the following command replacing <YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME> with your git username.\n-\n-````\n-git clone --recursive https://github.com/<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>/ballerina-lang.git\n-````\n-\n-If you download the sources, you need to update the git submodules using the following command.\n-\n-```\n-git submodule update --init \n-```\n-\n-Run the gradle command `./gradlew clean build` from the Ballerina root directory:\n-\n-Extract the Ballerina distribution created at `distribution/zip/ballerina/target/ballerina-<version>-SNAPSHOT.zip`. The `zip/ballerina` directory contains the runtime only. `zip/ballerina-tools/` contains the runtime and tools (e.g., Ballerina Composer).\n-\n-Note: It is possible to face an IOException error stating \"Too many open files\". This is due to the default number of possible open files being set to a lower number on your operating system than required for Ballerina to be compiled. You may have to increase the number of open files/file descriptors (FD) on your operating system. This is OS dependent and you can search the internet on how to do this for your operating system (Windows/OSX/Linux). You could update the maximum number of open files to 1000000 (or higher).\n-\n-### Setting up your development environment\n-\n-#### Setup IntelliJ IDEA\n+- [Get started](#get-started)\n+- [Set up the Prerequisites](#set-up-the-prerequisites)\n+- [Obtain the source code](#obtain-the-source-code)\n+- [Build the project](#build-the-project)\n+- [Set up the development environment](#set-up-the-development-environment)\n+    - [Set up the Ballerina plugin](#set-up-the-ballerina-plugin)\n+    - [Set up the ANTLR4 plugin](#set-up-the-antlr4-plugin)\n+- [Submit your contribution](#submit-your-contribution)\n+- [Accept the Contributor License Agreement](#accept-the-contributor-license-agreement)\n+- [Propose changes to Ballerina](#propose-changes-to-ballerina)\n \n-##### Importing a Ballerina Project\n+## Get started\n \n-Import the Ballerina project to IntelliJ IDEA similar to any other Gradle project. \n+- Join the conversations at:\n \n-* Navigate to `File | Open` menu.\n-* Browse the filesystem and Select Ballerina Project's root directory.\n-   * If prompted to import Gradle project select `Auto import`.\n-   * Set Project SDK as Java 1.8\n+    - [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ballerina): to get help with Ballerina (use the Ballerina tag for any of your questions)\n+    - [Slack](https://ballerina.io/community/slack/): for real-time discussions with the team and community\n+    - [Ballerina-Dev Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ballerina-dev): (developer team mailing list) to discuss Ballerina roadmap, features, and related issues\n+    - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ballerinalang): to tweet about Ballerina (use the \u201c#ballerinalang\u201d hashtag) \n \n-##### Useful IDEA Plugins\n+- Submitting a bug is just as important as contributing to code.

It is recommended to have some basic understanding on ANTLR4 grammar syntax and concepts, before working with the Ballerina grammar. \u201cParr, Terence (January 15, 2013), The Definitive ANTLR 4 Reference\u201d is a good reference to get started with.\n+    <div style=\"border:1px solid #000; padding: 10px;\">\n \n-Ballerina grammar can be found under [`<ballerina>/compiler/ballerina-lang/src/main/resources/grammar/`](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang/tree/master/compiler/ballerina-lang/src/main/resources/grammar) in the Ballerina repository. It consists of two files:\n+    Ballerina grammar has been implemented using ANTLR plugin version 4.5.3. To get a basic understanding of ANTLR grammar syntax and concepts before working with Ballerina grammar, go to [Parr, Terence (January 15, 2013), The Definitive ANTLR 4 Reference](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-definitive-antlr/9781941222621/).\n \n-* BallerinaLexer.g4 - Contains the lexer rules for Ballerina grammar.

High level grammar productions/abstractions are defined in the parser using those tokens.\n \n-#### Generating Parsers\n+    Once a change is done to any of the grammar files, the lexer and the parser need to be re-generated. To generate the lexer and the parser, navigate to the `<BALLERINA_PROJECT_ROOT>/compiler/ballerina-lang/src/main/resources/grammar/` directory, and execute the below command. \n \n-Once a change is done to any of the grammar files, the lexer and the parser need to be re-generated. To generate the lexer and the parser, first download the `antlr-complete-4.5.3.jar` file. Then navigate to `<ballerina>/compiler/ballerina-lang/src/main/resources/grammar/`, and execute the following command:\n-```\n-java -jar <path-to-antlr-jar>/antlr-4.5.3-complete.jar *.g4 -package org.wso2.ballerinalang.compiler.parser.antlr4 -o ../../java/org/wso2/ballerinalang/compiler/parser/antlr4/\n-```\n+    >**Tip:** Download the [antlr-complete-4.5.3.jar](https://jar-download.com/artifacts/org.antlr/antlr4/4.5.3/source-code) file and replace `<PATH-TO-ANTLR-JAR>` in the below command with the location in which you saved it.\n \n-The above command will autogenerate some Java classes. Out of the autogenerated classes, `BallerinaParserBaseListener.java` in particular is important, as the Ballerina AST builder is written on top of it. Thus, if any new rules are added to the BallerinaParser.g4, above command will generate new methods in the `BallerinaParserBaseListener.java`, and you need to override those newly added methods inside `BLangParserListener.java` accordingly.\n+    ```bash \n+    java -jar <PATH-TO-ANTLR-JAR>/antlr-4.5.3-complete.jar *.g4 -package org.wso2.ballerinalang.compiler.parser.antlr4 -o <BALLERINA_PROJECT_ROOT>/compiler/ballerina-lang/src/main/java/org/wso2/ballerinalang/compiler/parser/antlr4/\n+    ```\n \n-### Ballerina Compiler \n-https://medium.com/@sameera.jayasoma/ballerina-compiler-design-3406acc2476c\n+    **Info:** The above command will autogenerate some Java classes.

You can download one from one of the following locations:\n-\n-* [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)\n-* [http://openjdk.java.net/install/index.html](http://openjdk.java.net/install/index.html)\n-\n-> NOTE: Set an environment variable `JAVA_HOME` to the path name of the directory into which you installed the JDK release.\n-\n-**Prerequisite 2** - Node (v8.9.x or latest LTS release) + npm (v5.6.0 or later)\n-\n-**Prerequisite 3** - Docker \n-\n-#### Building from the source\n-\n-Clone this repository using the following command.\n-\n-```\n-git clone --recursive https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang.git\n-```\n-\n-If you have forked the repository to your github account then use the following command replacing <YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME> with your git username.\n-\n-````\n-git clone --recursive https://github.com/<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>/ballerina-lang.git\n-````\n-\n-If you download the sources, you need to update the git submodules using the following command.\n-\n-```\n-git submodule update --init \n-```\n-\n-Run the gradle command `./gradlew clean build` from the Ballerina root directory:\n-\n-Extract the Ballerina distribution created at `distribution/zip/ballerina/target/ballerina-<version>-SNAPSHOT.zip`. The `zip/ballerina` directory contains the runtime only. `zip/ballerina-tools/` contains the runtime and tools (e.g., Ballerina Composer).\n-\n-Note: It is possible to face an IOException error stating \"Too many open files\". This is due to the default number of possible open files being set to a lower number on your operating system than required for Ballerina to be compiled. You may have to increase the number of open files/file descriptors (FD) on your operating system. This is OS dependent and you can search the internet on how to do this for your operating system (Windows/OSX/Linux). You could update the maximum number of open files to 1000000 (or higher).\n-\n-### Setting up your development environment\n-\n-#### Setup IntelliJ IDEA\n+- [Get started](#get-started)\n+- [Set up the Prerequisites](#set-up-the-prerequisites)\n+- [Obtain the source code](#obtain-the-source-code)\n+- [Build the project](#build-the-project)\n+- [Set up the development environment](#set-up-the-development-environment)\n+    - [Set up the Ballerina plugin](#set-up-the-ballerina-plugin)\n+    - [Set up the ANTLR4 plugin](#set-up-the-antlr4-plugin)\n+- [Submit your contribution](#submit-your-contribution)\n+- [Accept the Contributor License Agreement](#accept-the-contributor-license-agreement)\n+- [Propose changes to Ballerina](#propose-changes-to-ballerina)\n \n-##### Importing a Ballerina Project\n+## Get started\n \n-Import the Ballerina project to IntelliJ IDEA similar to any other Gradle project. \n+- Join the conversations at:\n \n-* Navigate to `File | Open` menu.\n-* Browse the filesystem and Select Ballerina Project's root directory.\n-   * If prompted to import Gradle project select `Auto import`.\n-   * Set Project SDK as Java 1.8\n+    - [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ballerina): to get help with Ballerina (use the Ballerina tag for any of your questions)\n+    - [Slack](https://ballerina.io/community/slack/): for real-time discussions with the team and community\n+    - [Ballerina-Dev Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ballerina-dev): (developer team mailing list) to discuss Ballerina roadmap, features, and related issues", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3OTM5NjQzMw=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "6206dfb27f36d0b37fd2122e5988edc597533201"}, "originalPosition": 129}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMjM1ODc2Nzg2OnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "CONTRIBUTING.md", "isResolved": true, "comments": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMi0xOVQwNjowNzo1MFrOFrcFOw==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMi0xOVQwNjo0MDo1N1rOFrcmIw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4MTA5MzE3OQ==", "bodyText": "Shouldn't we move these two points to \"Get Started\".

You can download one from one of the following locations:\n-\n-* [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)\n-* [http://openjdk.java.net/install/index.html](http://openjdk.java.net/install/index.html)\n-\n-> NOTE: Set an environment variable `JAVA_HOME` to the path name of the directory into which you installed the JDK release.\n-\n-**Prerequisite 2** - Node (v8.9.x or latest LTS release) + npm (v5.6.0 or later)\n-\n-**Prerequisite 3** - Docker \n-\n-#### Building from the source\n-\n-Clone this repository using the following command.\n-\n-```\n-git clone --recursive https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang.git\n-```\n-\n-If you have forked the repository to your github account then use the following command replacing <YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME> with your git username.\n-\n-````\n-git clone --recursive https://github.com/<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>/ballerina-lang.git\n-````\n-\n-If you download the sources, you need to update the git submodules using the following command.\n-\n-```\n-git submodule update --init \n-```\n-\n-Run the gradle command `./gradlew clean build` from the Ballerina root directory:\n-\n-Extract the Ballerina distribution created at `distribution/zip/ballerina/target/ballerina-<version>-SNAPSHOT.zip`. The `zip/ballerina` directory contains the runtime only. `zip/ballerina-tools/` contains the runtime and tools (e.g., Ballerina Composer).\n-\n-Note: It is possible to face an IOException error stating \"Too many open files\". This is due to the default number of possible open files being set to a lower number on your operating system than required for Ballerina to be compiled. You may have to increase the number of open files/file descriptors (FD) on your operating system. This is OS dependent and you can search the internet on how to do this for your operating system (Windows/OSX/Linux). You could update the maximum number of open files to 1000000 (or higher).\n-\n-### Setting up your development environment\n-\n-#### Setup IntelliJ IDEA\n-\n-##### Importing a Ballerina Project\n+- [Get started](#get-started)\n+- [Set up the Prerequisites](#set-up-the-prerequisites)\n+- [Build the source code](#build-the-source-code)\n+- [Set up the development environment](#set-up-the-development-environment)\n+    - [Set up the Ballerina plugins](#set-up-the-ballerina-plugins)\n+    - [Set up the ANTLR4 plugin](#set-up-the-antlr4-plugin)\n+- [Submit your contribution](#submit-your-contribution)\n+- [Accept the Contributor License Agreement](#accept-the-contributor-license-agreement)\n+- [Propose changes to Ballerina](#propose-changes-to-ballerina)\n \n-Import the Ballerina project to IntelliJ IDEA similar to any other Gradle project. \n+## Get started\n \n-* Navigate to `File | Open` menu.\n-* Browse the filesystem and Select Ballerina Project's root directory.\n-   * If prompted to import Gradle project select `Auto import`.\n-   * Set Project SDK as Java 1.8\n+- Join the conversations at:\n \n-##### Useful IDEA Plugins\n+    - [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ballerina): to get help with Ballerina (use the Ballerina tag for any of your questions)\n+    - [Slack](https://ballerina.io/community/slack/): for real-time discussions with the team and community\n+    - [Ballerina-Dev Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ballerina-dev): (community mailing list) to discuss Ballerina roadmap, features, and related issues\n+    - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ballerinalang): to tweet about Ballerina (use the \u201c#ballerinalang\u201d hashtag) ", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "e65b1b5825b380ad09e09ac8802982643a777027"}, "originalPosition": 131}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4MTEwMjkyOQ==", "bodyText": "Added the below:\n\nGitHub: to file issues, join the conversations on new features, comment on other issues, and send your pull requests.", "url": "https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang/pull/21005#discussion_r381102929", "createdAt": "2020-02-19T06:45:42Z", "author": {"login": "praneesha"}, "path": "CONTRIBUTING.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -1,195 +1,115 @@\n # Contributing to Ballerina\n \n-Ballerina is an open source programming language and platform for cloud-era application programmers to easily write software that just works.\n-\n-We are an open-source project under Apache license and the work of hundreds of contributors.\n+Ballerina is an open source programming language and platform for cloud-era application programmers to easily write software.

You can download one from one of the following locations:\n-\n-* [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)\n-* [http://openjdk.java.net/install/index.html](http://openjdk.java.net/install/index.html)\n-\n-> NOTE: Set an environment variable `JAVA_HOME` to the path name of the directory into which you installed the JDK release.\n-\n-**Prerequisite 2** - Node (v8.9.x or latest LTS release) + npm (v5.6.0 or later)\n-\n-**Prerequisite 3** - Docker \n-\n-#### Building from the source\n-\n-Clone this repository using the following command.\n-\n-```\n-git clone --recursive https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang.git\n-```\n-\n-If you have forked the repository to your github account then use the following command replacing <YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME> with your git username.\n-\n-````\n-git clone --recursive https://github.com/<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>/ballerina-lang.git\n-````\n-\n-If you download the sources, you need to update the git submodules using the following command.\n-\n-```\n-git submodule update --init \n-```\n-\n-Run the gradle command `./gradlew clean build` from the Ballerina root directory:\n-\n-Extract the Ballerina distribution created at `distribution/zip/ballerina/target/ballerina-<version>-SNAPSHOT.zip`. The `zip/ballerina` directory contains the runtime only. `zip/ballerina-tools/` contains the runtime and tools (e.g., Ballerina Composer).\n-\n-Note: It is possible to face an IOException error stating \"Too many open files\". This is due to the default number of possible open files being set to a lower number on your operating system than required for Ballerina to be compiled. You may have to increase the number of open files/file descriptors (FD) on your operating system. This is OS dependent and you can search the internet on how to do this for your operating system (Windows/OSX/Linux). You could update the maximum number of open files to 1000000 (or higher).\n-\n-### Setting up your development environment\n-\n-#### Setup IntelliJ IDEA\n-\n-##### Importing a Ballerina Project\n+- [Get started](#get-started)\n+- [Set up the Prerequisites](#set-up-the-prerequisites)\n+- [Build the source code](#build-the-source-code)\n+- [Set up the development environment](#set-up-the-development-environment)\n+    - [Set up the Ballerina plugins](#set-up-the-ballerina-plugins)\n+    - [Set up the ANTLR4 plugin](#set-up-the-antlr4-plugin)\n+- [Submit your contribution](#submit-your-contribution)\n+- [Accept the Contributor License Agreement](#accept-the-contributor-license-agreement)\n+- [Propose changes to Ballerina](#propose-changes-to-ballerina)\n \n-Import the Ballerina project to IntelliJ IDEA similar to any other Gradle project. \n+## Get started\n \n-* Navigate to `File | Open` menu.\n-* Browse the filesystem and Select Ballerina Project's root directory.\n-   * If prompted to import Gradle project select `Auto import`.\n-   * Set Project SDK as Java 1.8\n+- Join the conversations at:\n \n-##### Useful IDEA Plugins\n+    - [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ballerina): to get help with Ballerina (use the Ballerina tag for any of your questions)\n+    - [Slack](https://ballerina.io/community/slack/): for real-time discussions with the team and community\n+    - [Ballerina-Dev Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ballerina-dev): (community mailing list) to discuss Ballerina roadmap, features, and related issues\n+    - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ballerinalang): to tweet about Ballerina (use the \u201c#ballerinalang\u201d hashtag) \n \n-* ANTLR 4 - https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7358-antlr-v4-grammar-plugin \n-* Ballerina - https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9520-ballerina (Need IDEA 2016.3 or newer)\n+- Submitting a bug is just as important as contributing to code.
