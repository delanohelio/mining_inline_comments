Thus, it is necessary to obtain the distribution of tablets under the same partition between different disks on a BE.\nThis patch add a new http interface for BE to acquire the distribution of tablets under a partition between different disks on the same BE.\nTypes of changes\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\nPut an x in the boxes that apply\n\n[] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\n New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\n[] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\n Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\n[] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\n\nChecklist\nPut an x in the boxes that apply.
