It would be useful to monitor permits hold by all executing compaction tasks and waitting compaction task.\n\n\nAdd log which can be chosen by config  for merge rowsets.  It would be helpful to track the process of rowsets merging for compaction task which lasts for a long time.\n\n\nTypes of changes\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\nPut an x in the boxes that apply\n\n[] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\n New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\n[] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\n Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\n[] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\n\nChecklist\nPut an x in the boxes that apply.
