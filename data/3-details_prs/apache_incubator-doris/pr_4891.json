When a tablet could hold permits, compaction task for this tablet will be submitted to  thread pool. We take compaction score as permits which is used for limiting memory consumption. However,  pick_rowset_to_compaction() will be executed before the file merge in compaction thread, and the number of segment files that actually perform the merge operation is smaller than compaction score. In addition, it is also possible that compaction task exits directly because the tablet doesn't meet the requirements of compaction.\nThis patch optimizes and refactors the code of compaction, so that we can execute 'pick rowsets' before applying for permits for a compaction task, calculate the number of segment files that actually participate in the merge operation, and take this number as permits.\nTypes of changes\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\nPut an x in the boxes that apply\n\n[] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\n New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\n[] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\n[] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\n Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\n\nChecklist\nPut an x in the boxes that apply.
