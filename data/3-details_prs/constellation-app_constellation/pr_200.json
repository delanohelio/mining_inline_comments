FlagIconProvider.java was modified accordingly to reflect the directory location change of the flag images.\nAlternate Designs\n\nAn alternate set was initially proposed as it had all 218 flags in a consistent style, from here https://github.com/gosquared/flags. While the flags were more accurate with better detail, the maximum resolution of the set was 64x64. It was advised that at that resolution the images would be upscaled and the improvement in quality would become negligible.\nThe current sets chosen contain flags which are 512x512 or greater which have been resized to 256x256, the maximum resolution currently supported by Constellation.\n216/218 were sourced from here https://www.flaticon.com/packs/international-flags/2.\nGuyana's flag was sourced from here https://www.flaticon.com/packs/flags-15.\nA matching style and high resolution version for the New Caledonia flag was not found from the same site the other sets were found, so a 1280x640 image from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanak_people was used.\nWhy Should This Be In Core?\n\nMore accurate depiction of country flags.\nBenefits\n\nFlags are more accurate and previously some flags had been replicated to compensate for missing flags, such as the reuse of the Liberia flag for the United States of America.\nThe flags are also more consistent now with the slight exception of the New Caledonia flag.\nPossible Drawbacks\n\nHigher resolution may now increase startup and load times of Constellation and graphs.\nVerification Process\n\nFunctionality was verified by opening a new graph in Constellation and navigating to \"Experimental\" > \"Build Graph\" > \"Sphere Graph Builder\" and visually checking the whether the code and file changes were taking effect.\nApplicable Issues\n\n#152", "createdAt": "2020-01-15T01:48:27Z", "url": "https://github.com/constellation-app/constellation/pull/200", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "859169fcda709b5287926da279475bf848491f25"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-01-20T05:25:05Z", "author": {"login": "sol695510"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 5, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABb6ap9dAH2gAyMzYyOTE4MzMwOmYxODg5N2M4NzI0MTI5NzkxMjA1ZDg4MDRkZjg0MzgwODg4OTUzZDQ=", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABb8FpQBAFqTM0NTA4NDkxNQ==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "f18897c8724129791205d8804df84380888953d4", "author": {"user": {"login": "sol695510", "name": null}}, "url": "https://github.com/constellation-app/constellation/commit/f18897c8724129791205d8804df84380888953d4", "committedDate": "2020-01-15T00:45:54Z", "message": "#152 Use higher quality images for country flags"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "d4d55580f1e4f5984d6d2ab1696ba0d5a82d61bf", "author": {"user": {"login": "sol695510", "name": null}}, "url": "https://github.com/constellation-app/constellation/commit/d4d55580f1e4f5984d6d2ab1696ba0d5a82d61bf", "committedDate": "2020-01-15T01:50:14Z", "message": "Merge branch 'master' into Update-country-flags"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3MzQzMDAwMDYz", "url": "https://github.com/constellation-app/constellation/pull/200#pullrequestreview-343000063", "createdAt": "2020-01-15T05:51:57Z", "commit": {"oid": "d4d55580f1e4f5984d6d2ab1696ba0d5a82d61bf"}, "state": "CHANGES_REQUESTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMS0xNVQwNTo1MTo1N1rOFdt62A==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMS0xNVQwNTo1MTo1N1rOFdt62A==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM2NjcwNTM2OA==", "bodyText": "Thanks @sol695510, creating the flags folder was something I wanted to see done too.
