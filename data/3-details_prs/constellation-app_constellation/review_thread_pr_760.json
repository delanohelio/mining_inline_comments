I want to store a map into the preferences but have not found a method to set an object into the preferences. it only takes String or numeric values.\nFrom this I've pivoted to converting the map to a json String. I've looked through the utils and haven't found anything out the box. Do you have any suggestions re this or another possible solution?\n\nIt didn't look like any of the \"Rule\" classes like UnknownTypeRule needed any changes; that's interesting and good actually.\n\nIdeally this was what I was going for so I'm glad it all works without needing further extensions to those classes.\n\nCan you please write some unit tests to cover the logic? If you want a hand just let me know and happy to help writing uni tests.\n\n\nThere should be a mention about this change to the users via the whatsnew.txt file informing them that scores are replaced by categories.\n\nI can do these. \ud83c\udf70\n\nRunning this in a static block like this means this bit of code must run when the class is loaded into memory (i.e when Constellation loads).\n\nOhh no worries, I think that should be an easy fix.\n\nFYI the call to Lookup isn't super efficient.
