It was not a false positive, but really a flake, where sometimes the member would be removed from the cluster when its new version joined, but sometimes it would be removed due to missed probes (depending on timing), and so a REACHABILITY_CHANGED event would be sent. Fix was to extract testing that newer versions evict older versions of a member into a separate test, and not stopping the older member (since it isn't really necessary afaik - correct me if I'm wrong).\nRelated issues\ncloses #4633\nPull Request Checklist\n\n All commit messages match our commit message guidelines\n The submitting code follows our code style\n If submitting code, please run mvn clean install -DskipTests locally before committing", "createdAt": "2020-06-02T06:49:34Z", "url": "https://github.com/camunda-cloud/zeebe/pull/4647", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "379afe7174267f168d967b09d295e5b5ab0fd6c4"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-06-02T10:03:18Z", "author": {"login": "npepinpe"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 3, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABcnPulLgFqTQyMjQwODYyMQ==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABcnQdTagBqjMzOTY0NDY0NDI=", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDIyNDA4NjIx", "url": "https://github.com/camunda-cloud/zeebe/pull/4647#pullrequestreview-422408621", "createdAt": "2020-06-02T07:25:50Z", "commit": {"oid": "1115390a9fedca44d7082996f85c3b113816b829"}, "state": "APPROVED", "comments": {"totalCount": 3, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNi0wMlQwNzoyNTo1MFrOGdlRuQ==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNi0wMlQwNzoyNzozMVrOGdlVOw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzMzY3MjYzMw==", "bodyText": "Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n                // Stop member 2 and change its version;
