After that is always uses the snapshot interval to schedule the next snapshots.\nI added also a check on the Broker start (system context), which disallows snapshot periods smaller then one minutes, since this make no sense actually.\nI will run a benchmark after lunch.\n\nRelated issues\n\ncloses #3376\nPull Request Checklist\n\n All commit messages match our commit message guidelines\n The
