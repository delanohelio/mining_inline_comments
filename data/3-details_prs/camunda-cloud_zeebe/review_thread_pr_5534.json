If the cluster contains multiple brokers then these steps can be done for all brokers in parallel. Standalone gateways should be upgrade after all brokers in the cluster are upgrade to avoid mismatches in the protocol version.\n+\n+Note that this procedure results in a downtime of the whole cluster.

Stop the workflow processing\n+    * Close all job workers\n+    * Interrupt the incoming connections to avoid user commands\n+1. Wait until a snapshot is created for all partitions\n+    * By default, a snapshot is created every 15 minutes\n+    * Verify that a snapshot is created by looking at the [Metric](/operations/metrics.md) `zeebe_snapshot_count` on the leader and the followers\n+    * Note that no snapshot is created if no processing happened since the last snapshot\n+1. Make a backup of the `data` folder\n+\n+#### From broker version >= 24.4\n+\n+The [Partitions Admin Endpoint](#partitions-admin-endpoint) can be used to query the status of the partitions and perform operations for the upgrade.\n+\n+1. Stop the workflow processing and trigger a snapshot creation\n+    * Call the `prepareUpgrade` operation on the partitions endpoint\n+    * Query the status of the partitions until the following conditions are met for all partitions:\n+        * `processedPositionInSnapshot` is equal to `processedPosition`\n+        * all followers (role: `FOLLOWER`) have the same `snapshotId` as the leader (role: `LEADER`)\n+1. Make a backup of the `data` folder\n+\n+### Performing the Upgrade\n+\n+1. Shut down the broker\n+1. Replace the `/bin` and `/lib` folders with the versions of the new distribution\n+1. Start up the broker\n+\n+### Verifying the Upgrade\n+\n+The upgrade is successful if the following conditions are met:\n+\n+* the broker is ready (see [Ready Check](/operations/health.md#ready-check))\n+* the broker is healthy (see [Health Check](/operations/health.md#health-check))\n+* all partitions are healthy (see the [Metric](/operations/metrics.md#metrics-related-to-health) `zeebe_health`)\n+* the stream processors of the partition leaders are in the phase `PROCESSING` (see [Partitions Admin Endpoint](#partitions-admin-endpoint))\n+\n+If the upgrade failed because of a known issue then a partition change its status to unhealthy, and the log output may contain the following error message:\n+\n+<details>\n+  <summary>Sample Upgrade Error Message</summary>\n+  <p>\n+\n+```\n+Unexpected error on recovery happens.\n+io.zeebe.engine.processor.InconsistentReprocessingException: Reprocessing issue detected!\n+  Restore the data from a backup and follow the recommended upgrade procedure.
