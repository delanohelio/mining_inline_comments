It's not currently possible to run the RollingUpgradeTest, so to test it yourself, you can verify it works by changing the tests to upgrade from current-test to current-test instead of 0.24.0 to current-test.\nI wouldn't back port this, as this affects only tests. I'm aware this may make back porting later regression tests more complicated though, so I'm open to discussion (note that this doesn't really affect 0.23 which will be phased out soon, but could be useful for 0.24).\nDefinition of Done\nNot all items need to be done depending on the issue and the pull request.\nCode changes:\n\n The changes are backwards compatibility with previous versions\n If it fixes a bug then PRs are created to backport the fix to the last two minor versions\n\nTesting:\n\n There are unit/integration tests that verify all acceptance criterias of the issue\n New tests are written to ensure backwards compatibility with further versions\n The behavior is tested manually\n The impact of the changes is verified by a benchmark\n\nDocumentation:\n\n The documentation is updated (e.g. BPMN reference, configuration, examples, get-started guides, etc.)\n New content is added to the release announcement", "createdAt": "2020-09-09T13:43:38Z", "url": "https://github.com/camunda-cloud/zeebe/pull/5322", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "05f51236fddb91024958769a44e6db7088a1289f"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-09-10T14:50:13Z", "author": {"login": "npepinpe"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABdHMX4XgH2gAyNDgyODU1MzQzOmMyZjIxOTAzYWUyYjk3NDE2YzJjMmU3ZjExMmJlZjk3OWNhNTM4ZjI=", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABdHhbN3AFqTQ4NTk3MTQ3Mg==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "c2f21903ae2b97416c2c2e7f112bef979ca538f2", "author": {"user": {"login": "npepinpe", "name": "Nicolas Pepin-Perreault"}}, "url": "https://github.com/camunda-cloud/zeebe/commit/c2f21903ae2b97416c2c2e7f112bef979ca538f2", "committedDate": "2020-09-09T13:39:39Z", "message": "chore(parent): upgrade Zeebe Test Container to 1.0.0"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDg1OTcxNDcy", "url": "https://github.com/camunda-cloud/zeebe/pull/5322#pullrequestreview-485971472", "createdAt": "2020-09-10T14:04:59Z", "commit": {"oid": "c2f21903ae2b97416c2c2e7f112bef979ca538f2"}, "state": "APPROVED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wOS0xMFQxNDowNDo1OVrOHP1uOw==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wOS0xMFQxNDowNDo1OVrOHP1uOw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4NjM3MDg3NQ==", "bodyText": "Did it become slower?", "url": "https://github.com/camunda-cloud/zeebe/pull/5322#discussion_r486370875", "createdAt": "2020-09-10T14:04:59Z", "author": {"login": "korthout"}, "path": "upgrade-tests/src/test/java/io/zeebe/test/RollingUpdateTest.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -119,7 +118,7 @@ public void shouldBeAbleToRestartContainerWithNewVersion() {\n     // then\n     try (final var client = newZeebeClient(containers.get(1))) {\n       Awaitility.await()\n-          .atMost(Duration.ofSeconds(5))\n+          .atMost(Duration.ofSeconds(10))", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "c2f21903ae2b97416c2c2e7f112bef979ca538f2"}, "originalPosition": 62}]}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 2482, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-01T13:07:16Z"}}}
