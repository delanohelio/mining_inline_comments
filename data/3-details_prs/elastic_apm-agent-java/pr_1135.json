The goal of this documentation is to better surface and explain the different ways of finding slow methods within a service. Within this new page, we have four additional sections:\n\nSampling-based profiler\nAPI/Code\nAnnotations\nConfiguration-based\n\nContent for these sections was adapted from Felix's blog post, the API documentation, and supported-technologies. The code examples I created could probably use some help.\n@felixbarny, Check out the documentation preview to get a feel for this PR. I would love to hear your thoughts. There's still a bit to do to clean this up, but I wanted to share it with you before continuing in case you had something different in mind. We can jump on a call, too, if need be. I may end up moving this into a new how-to section before merging as I've done with the APM Server and Kibana.\nDocumentation preview\nhttp://apm-agent-java_1135.docs-preview.app.elstc.co/diff\nhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/java/master/java-method-monitoring.html\nScreenshots\n\n\nRelated issues\nCloses #1092.", "createdAt": "2020-04-13T23:19:11Z", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-java/pull/1135", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "2d30f324f482f8dca568427cb7a1787ee80d9ec4"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-04-15T16:18:00Z", "author": {"login": "bmorelli25"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 12, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABcXfm7XgFqTM5MjY2NjA2NA==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABcX5cIDgBqjMyMzU5MDcyNzc=", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3MzkyNjY2MDY0", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-java/pull/1135#pullrequestreview-392666064", "createdAt": "2020-04-14T07:26:32Z", "commit": {"oid": "6134df2505237285b6b805583632a0fb85b7290c"}, "state": "CHANGES_REQUESTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 11, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNC0xNFQwNzoyNjozMlrOGFBhmA==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNC0xNFQwODo1NDo1NVrOGFEvtQ==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwNzkyMTA0OA==", "bodyText": "Could be misunderstood that people have to install async-profiler, which is not the case.
