EOL dates were determined by going through old releases, finding the GA release date of the major Java Agent versions, and adding 18 months.\nWhy is it important?\nWe love all our products, but sometimes we must say goodbye to a release so that we can continue moving forward on future development and innovation.\nWhat does EOL/Maintenance mean?\n\nWhen a version goes out of maintenance, it is no longer guaranteed to get bug fixes. Between the end of maintenance and EOL, bug fixes will be discretionary, e.g. critical security issues. Once it's EOL, it's no longer given any support attention; issues related to it will be closed with WONTFIX.\n\nRelated issues\nFor elastic/apm#173.\nScreenshots", "createdAt": "2020-02-18T20:35:04Z", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-java/pull/1044", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "2870994fd95d8e84362e108f41dffac337f299db"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-03-11T01:30:52Z", "author": {"login": "bmorelli25"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 9, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABcFn_-qgH2gAyMzc2ODIyMTc4OjUyZWQwNDNiZmU3NDhiN2ZjMWQxNWMwZGM0M2M3NTg4OWYyYjgwMGI=", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABcMW2bUAH2gAyMzc2ODIyMTc4OmY1MzcxOWMyODAxZmU1MGQ2NTY3NzFkNTRjNmVlYWNjM2Y0MDk1MjE=", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "52ed043bfe748b7fc1d15c0dc43c75889f2b800b", "author": {"user": {"login": "bmorelli25", "name": "Brandon Morelli"}}, "url": "https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-java/commit/52ed043bfe748b7fc1d15c0dc43c75889f2b800b", "committedDate": "2020-02-18T20:31:53Z", "message": "docs: add EOL table"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "bc4623c0b1a4ec7eae9e3d57ee636aaa99451f10", "author": {"user": {"login": "bmorelli25", "name": "Brandon Morelli"}}, "url": "https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-java/commit/bc4623c0b1a4ec7eae9e3d57ee636aaa99451f10", "committedDate": "2020-02-18T20:32:18Z", "message": "docs: it\u2019s been three months, let\u2019s delete"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "3a9c25fb91fca0a03715f734b8a29877a5e959af", "author": {"user": {"login": "bmorelli25", "name": "Brandon Morelli"}}, "url": "https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-java/commit/3a9c25fb91fca0a03715f734b8a29877a5e959af", "committedDate": "2020-02-19T16:45:16Z", "message": "docs: update EOL table with minors"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3MzYxMzA1NjEy", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-java/pull/1044#pullrequestreview-361305612", "createdAt": "2020-02-19T17:51:11Z", "commit": {"oid": "3a9c25fb91fca0a03715f734b8a29877a5e959af"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMi0xOVQxNzo1MToxMVrOFrxVqA==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMi0xOVQxNzo1MToxMVrOFrxVqA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4MTQ0MTQ0OA==", "bodyText": "I find this even more confusing now \ud83d\ude04\nEOL date is in the future (2021-05-21), yet we don't support it anymore because there's a new minor (1.13.0)\nI think this table will only be really useful once we release a new Major version.
