I won't be able to add a test right now ( have a long list of things I should be doing) but I may give it a try in the coming weeks. I think an integration test might be appropriate, and maybe that could be done in the overlay since it has a docker image that could be used for both types of clusters, in kubernetes and with a regular docker network. According to this https://github.com/lilic/travis-minikube/blob/master/.travis.yml you can run minikube in a travis ci build. Starting up two CAS servers with cluster config wouldn't be too hard, but maybe there would need to be a \"test\" session scoped bean that could be accessed and modified via a session replication testing endpoint? I suppose the non-kubernetes cluster could be tested without docker but it would require an actuator or something to test the replication was working.", "url": "https://github.com/apereo/cas/pull/4739#discussion_r386062350", "createdAt": "2020-02-29T23:14:46Z", "author": {"login": "hdeadman"}, "path": "docs/cas-server-documentation/configuration/Configuration-Properties.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -599,12 +599,15 @@ Enabling APR requires the following JVM system property that indicates the locat\n \n #### Session Clustering & Replication\n \n-Enable session replication to replicate web application session deltas.\n+Enable session replication to replicate web application session deltas. \n+\n+Most settings apply to the `DEFAULT` type, which requires membes to be defined.
