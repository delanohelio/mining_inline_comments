There are\n+alternatives for some of these settings but this is the recommended setup.\n \n-<!-- _\"In most cases, ...\" Unclear: the cases being the different Operating Systems? -->\n-All settings changes are made to files residing in the Opencast configuration directory. In most cases, that should be either\n-`/etc/opencast/` or `/opt/opencast/etc/`. Edit the files using the editor of your choice, e.g.:\n-\n-    vim /etc/opencast/custom.properties\n+All settings changes are made to files residing in the Opencast configuration directory.\n+The location of the configuration directory depends on how you installed Opencast.\n+If you used the Linux packages, the location is `/etc/opencast`.\n \n \n Step 1: Setting the Server URL\n ------------------------------\n \n-By default, only connections from the local machine are accepted by Opencast.  You want to change this if the system\n-should be accessible within a network.\n-\n-First, find the property `org.opencastproject.server.url` in your `custom.properties` configuration file and set it to\n-your own domain name:\n+Find the property `org.opencastproject.server.url` in `etc/custom.properties` and set your domain name.\n+The value must be set to the URL from which the server can be accessed later.\n \n-    org.opencastproject.server.url=http://example.com:8080\n+    org.opencastproject.server.url=https://example.opencast.org\n \n-*Note:* This value will be written to all generated mediapackages and thus cannot be changed easily for already\n-processed media, at least not without an extra amount of work involving modifications to the database. That is why you\n-should think about this setting carefully.\n+*Note:* This value will be written to all generated media packages and thus cannot be changed easily for already\n+processed media. Please think about this setting carefully.\n \n \n-Step 2: Setting the Login Details\n----------------------------------\n+Step 2: Setting Authentication Details\n+--------------------------------------\n \n-There are two authentication methods for Opencast: HTTP Digest authentication and form-based authentication. Both\n-methods need a username and a password. Change the password for both! The important keys in the 'custom.properties'\n-configuration file are:\n+Configure authentication and security details of Opencast, including the login credentials.\n+For this, the important keys in the `etc/custom.properties` configuration file are:\n \n * `org.opencastproject.security.admin.user`\n     * The user for the administrative account. This is set to `admin` by default.\n * `org.opencastproject.security.admin.pass`\n     * The password for the administrative account. This is set to `opencast` by default.\n * `org.opencastproject.security.digest.user`\n-    * The user for the communication between Opencast nodes, as well as for capture agents. This is set to\n-    `opencast_system_account` by default.\n+    * The user for the communication between Opencast nodes. It is sometimes also used by capture agents.\n+      This is set to `opencast_system_account` by default.\n * `org.opencastproject.security.digest.pass`\n-    * The password for the communication between Opencast nodes and capture agents.

It is sometimes also used by capture agents.\n+      This is set to `CHANGE_ME` by default.\n+* `karaf.shutdown.command`\n+    * The security token used for shutting down Opencast. Set this to a random string.\n \n-*Note:* The digest credentials are also used for internal communication of Opencast servers. So these keys have to be\n-set to the same value on each of your Opencast nodes (Core, Worker, Capture Agent, \u2026)\n+Make sure that these settings are identical on all nodes of the cluster.\n \n \n-Step 3: Change the default shutdown command\n--------------------------------------------\n+Step 3: Setting up Apache ActiveMQ Message Broker\n+-------------------------------------------------\n \n-Karaf provides a socket over which you can send a shutdown command. The socket does not provide any kind of\n-authentication. Therefore anyone who obtains write access to this socket is able to shutdown karaf and everything\n-that runs on it. There is a default `karaf.shutdown.command` defined in `custom.properties`. Change this to something\n-secret.\n+Opencast requires Apache ActiveMQ to relay messages between micro-services.\n+For configuration details, please follow the:\n \n+- [Apache ActiveMQ configuration guide](message-broker.md)\n \n-Step 4: Setting up Apache ActiveMQ Message Broker\n--------------------------------------------------\n-<!-- _This is a very nonchalant and subdued description for how important this config probably is -->\n-Since version 2.0, Opencast requires a running Apache ActiveMQ instance with a specific configuration.  The message\n-broker is mostly run on the admin server of Opencast but can be run separately.

This is basically what you should do, right after installing Opencast on your machine.\n+This guide will help you to adjust the basic configuration settings strongly recommended for each Opencast installation.\n+This is what you should do right after installing Opencast.\n+There are alternatives for some of these settings but this is the recommended setup.\n \n-<!-- _\"In most cases, ...\" Unclear: the cases being the different Operating Systems? -->\n-All settings changes are made to files residing in the Opencast configuration directory. In most cases, that should be either\n-`/etc/opencast/` or `/opt/opencast/etc/`. Edit the files using the editor of your choice, e.g.:\n-\n-    vim /etc/opencast/custom.properties\n+All settings changes are made to files residing in the Opencast configuration directory.\n+The location of the configuration directory depends on how you installed Opencast.\n+If you used the Linux packages, the location is `/etc/opencast`.\n \n \n Step 1: Setting the Server URL\n ------------------------------\n \n-By default, only connections from the local machine are accepted by Opencast.  You want to change this if the system\n-should be accessible within a network.\n-\n-First, find the property `org.opencastproject.server.url` in your `custom.properties` configuration file and set it to\n-your own domain name:\n+Find the property `org.opencastproject.server.url` in `etc/custom.properties` and set your domain name.\n+The value must be set to the URL from which the server can be accessed later.\n \n-    org.opencastproject.server.url=http://example.com:8080\n+    org.opencastproject.server.url=https://example.opencast.org\n \n-*Note:* This value will be written to all generated mediapackages and thus cannot be changed easily for already\n-processed media, at least not without an extra amount of work involving modifications to the database. That is why you\n-should think about this setting carefully.\n+*Note:* This value will be written to all generated media packages and thus cannot be changed easily for already\n+processed media. Please think about this setting carefully.\n \n \n-Step 2: Setting the Login Details\n----------------------------------\n+Step 2: Setting Authentication Details\n+--------------------------------------\n \n-There are two authentication methods for Opencast: HTTP Digest authentication and form-based authentication. Both\n-methods need a username and a password. Change the password for both! The important keys in the 'custom.properties'\n-configuration file are:\n+Configure authentication and security details of Opencast, including the login credentials.\n+For this, the important keys in the `etc/custom.properties` configuration file are:\n \n * `org.opencastproject.security.admin.user`\n     * The user for the administrative account. This is set to `admin` by default.\n * `org.opencastproject.security.admin.pass`\n     * The password for the administrative account. This is set to `opencast` by default.\n * `org.opencastproject.security.digest.user`\n-    * The user for the communication between Opencast nodes, as well as for capture agents. This is set to\n-    `opencast_system_account` by default.\n+    * The user for the communication between Opencast nodes. It is sometimes also used by capture agents.\n+      This is set to `opencast_system_account` by default.\n * `org.opencastproject.security.digest.pass`\n-    * The password for the communication between Opencast nodes and capture agents. This is set to `CHANGE_ME` by default.\n-\n-*Note:* The digest credentials are also used for internal communication of Opencast servers. So these keys have to be\n-set to the same value on each of your Opencast nodes (Core, Worker, Capture Agent, \u2026)\n+    * The password for the communication between Opencast nodes. It is sometimes also used by capture agents.\n+      This is set to `CHANGE_ME` by default.\n+* `karaf.shutdown.command`\n+    * The security token used for shutting down Opencast. Set this to a random string.\n \n+Make sure that these settings are identical on all nodes of the cluster.\n \n-Step 3: Change the default shutdown command\n--------------------------------------------\n \n-Karaf provides a socket over which you can send a shutdown command. The socket does not provide any kind of\n-authentication. Therefore anyone who obtains write access to this socket is able to shutdown karaf and everything\n-that runs on it. There is a default `karaf.shutdown.command` defined in `custom.properties`. Change this to something\n-secret.\n+Step 3: Setting up Apache ActiveMQ Message Broker\n+-------------------------------------------------\n \n+Opencast requires Apache ActiveMQ to relay messages between micro-services.\n+For configuration details, please follow the:\n \n-Step 4: Setting up Apache ActiveMQ Message Broker\n--------------------------------------------------\n-<!-- _This is a very nonchalant and subdued description for how important this config probably is -->\n-Since version 2.0, Opencast requires a running Apache ActiveMQ instance with a specific configuration.
