We want a single source of truth, and discarding the original after trimming it seems wrong to me.\nThat being said, those saying that the user trimmed the video prior to ingesting it, and that we should respect that do have a point.  What if the user is trimming off something that's not allowed to be kept (say, privacy reasons, or licensing).  Do our adopters run a risk by potentially having that footage in their archive, whether they know they have it or not?  If the trim in Studio was truly done client side (this would be a nice feature), then we wouldn't get the data at all - and we would be ok with that.  So why do we feel like we get to keep it when the presentr thinks that we're not even getting it in the first place.  Normally I would say that the presenter is out of luck, but especially in light of the current COVID-19 situation we have to assume that these recordings may be being done in suboptimal places.  Kids could be run through the frame, someone could spill their coffee, all kinds of things which would not otherwise occur in a classroom or office setting.\nAs much as I prefer in all other cases to keep the original source media and create an intermediate trimmed copy, I think in this case we need to respect user choice.  Perhaps we should document that this is not what is done in other cases in the studio docs, so that institutions can make the choice to keep everything if they really feel a need for it.
