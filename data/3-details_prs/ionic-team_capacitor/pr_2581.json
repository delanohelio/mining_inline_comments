The following examples assume this.\n+\n+### Angular\n+\n+Routing should be implemented in `app.component.ts`. Start by importing `NgZone` and `Router` from Angular, then `App` from Capacitor:\n+\n+```typescript\n+import { Component, NgZone } from '@angular/core';\n+import { Router } from '@angular/router';\n+import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';\n+const { App } = Plugins;\n+```\n+\n+Next, add `Router` and `NgZone` to the constructor:\n+\n+```typescript\n+constructor(private router: Router, private zone: NgZone) {\n+    this.initializeApp();\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Last, listen for the `appUrlOpen` event, and redirect when a deep link is found:\n+\n+```typescript\n+initializeApp() {\n+    App.addListener('appUrlOpen', (data: any) => {\n+        this.zone.run(() => {\n+            // Example url: https://beerswift.app/tabs/tab2\n+            // slug = /tabs/tab2\n+            const slug = data.url.split(\".app\").pop();\n+            if (slug) {\n+                this.router.navigateByUrl(slug);\n+            }\n+            // If no match, do nothing - let regular routing \n+            // logic take over\n+        });\n+    });\n+}\n+```\n+\n+### React\n+\n+There's a variety of options for React. One approach is to wrap the App API listener functionality in a new component, then add it inside of `App.tsx`.
