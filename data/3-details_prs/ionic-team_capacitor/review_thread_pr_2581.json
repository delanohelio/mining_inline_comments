If your mobile app and web app use the same codebase though, this is very straightforward - just redirect to the same URL. The following examples assume this.\n+\n+### Angular\n+\n+Routing should be implemented in `app.component.ts`. Start by importing `NgZone` and `Router` from Angular, then `App` from Capacitor:\n+\n+```typescript\n+import { Component, NgZone } from '@angular/core';\n+import { Router } from '@angular/router';\n+import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';\n+const { App } = Plugins;\n+```\n+\n+Next, add `Router` and `NgZone` to the constructor:\n+\n+```typescript\n+constructor(private router: Router, private zone: NgZone) {\n+    this.initializeApp();\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Last, listen for the `appUrlOpen` event, and redirect when a deep link is found:\n+\n+```typescript\n+initializeApp() {\n+    App.addListener('appUrlOpen', (data: any) => {\n+        this.zone.run(() => {\n+            // Example url: https://beerswift.app/tabs/tab2\n+            // slug = /tabs/tab2\n+            const slug = data.url.split(\".app\").pop();\n+            if (slug) {\n+                this.router.navigateByUrl(slug);\n+            }\n+            // If no match, do nothing - let regular routing \n+            // logic take over\n+        });\n+    });\n+}\n+```\n+\n+### React\n+\n+There's a variety of options for React. One approach is to wrap the App API listener functionality in a new component, then add it inside of `App.tsx`. Start by creating `AppUrlListener.tsx` then import the React Router `useHistory` hook as well as the Capacitor App API:\n+\n+```typescript\n+import React, { useEffect } from 'react';\n+import { useHistory } from \"react-router-dom\";\n+import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';\n+const { App: CapApp } = Plugins;\n+```\n+\n+Next, define the AppUrlListener component, listening for the `appUrlOpen` event then redirecting when a deep link is found:\n+\n+```typescript\n+const AppUrlListener: React.FC<any> = () => {\n+    let history = useHistory();\n+    useEffect(() => {\n+        CapApp.addListener('appUrlOpen', (data: any) => {\n+            // Example url: https://beerswift.app/tabs/tab2\n+            // slug = /tabs/tab2\n+            const slug = data.url.split(\".app\").pop();\n+            if (slug) {\n+                history.push(slug);\n+            }\n+            // If no match, do nothing - let regular routing \n+            // logic take over\n+        });\n+    }, []);\n+\n+    return null;\n+};\n+\n+export default AppUrlListener;\n+```\n+\n+Over in `App.tsx`, import the new component:\n+\n+```typescript\n+import AppUrlListener from './pages/AppUrlListener';\n+```\n+\n+Then add it inside of `IonReactRouter` (or wherever your app is bootstrapped, just ensure that the History hook is available):\n+\n+```tsx\n+const App: React.FC = () => {\n+    return (\n+        <IonApp>\n+            <IonReactRouter>\n+                <AppUrlListener></AppUrlListener>\n+                <IonRouterOutlet>\n+                    <Route path=\"/home\" component={Home} exact={true} />\n+                    <Route exact path=\"/\" render={() => <Redirect to=\"/home\" />} />\n+                </IonRouterOutlet>\n+            </IonReactRouter>\n+        </IonApp>\n+    );\n+};\n+```\n+\n+## Creating Site Association Files\n+\n+In order for Apple and Google to permit deep links to open your app, a two-way association between your website and app must be created. One file for each must be created and placed within a `.well-known` folder on your website, like so: https://beerswift.app/.well-known/.\n+\n+Continue on for iOS and Android configuration details.\n+\n+## iOS Configuration\n+\n+iOS configuration involves creating a site association file and configuring the native app to recognize the app domain.\n+\n+> You must be enrolled in the Apple Developer Program.\n+\n+### Create Site Association File\n+\n+First, log into the [Apple Developer site](https://developer.apple.com). Navigate to the \"Certificates, Identifiers, & Profiles\" section and select your app's identifier. Note the Team ID and Bundle ID, and under Capabilities, toggle \"Associated Domains\" then save:\n+\n+![iOS Identifier Config](/assets/img/docs/guides/deep-links/ios-config.png)\n+\n+Next, create the site association file (`apple-app-site-association`).\n+\n+> Note: Despite being a JSON file, do not save it with a file extension.\n+\n+```json\n+// apple-app-site-association\n+{\n+    \"applinks\": {\n+        \"apps\": [],\n+        \"details\": [\n+            {\n+                // example: 8L65AZE66A.com.netkosoft.beerswift\n+                \"appID\": \"TEAMID.BUNDLEID\",\n+                \"paths\": [\"*\"]\n+            }\n+        ]\n+    }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+> Note: Some tutorials mention that the file must be served with content type `application/pkcs7-mime`.

If your app runs in iOS 9 or later and you use HTTPS to serve the file, you can create a plain text file that uses the `application/json` MIME type.\n+\n+Next, upload the file to your web site (hosted on HTTPS), then validate that it's configured correctly using Apple's tool [here](https://search.developer.apple.com/appsearch-validation-tool/). The URL should follow this format: https://beerswift.app/.well-known/apple-app-site-association\n+\n+### Add Associated Domain\n+\n+The final step is to configure the iOS app to recognize incoming links.

If the app isn't installed, then the user is directed to the website. If the user navigates directly to the website, they remain on the website.  This makes deep links an excellent feature for cross-platform apps built for the web, iOS, and Android.\n+\n+Benefits:\n+- Secure: Universal/App Links use HTTPS URLs that link to a website domain that you own, ensuring that no other app can use your links.\n+- Seamless experience: One URL works for both your website and app, ensuring that users can successfully access the content they're looking for without errors.\n+- Increase Engagement: Links can be opened from email clients, search engine results, and more.\n+\n+## Demo Video\n+\n+Here's what it looks like in practice. In this example, the user has the native app installed. They tap on app links from an email and are brought directly into the app itself. First, the root link is tapped (https://beerswift.app), which directs the user to the main app page. Next, a deep link is tapped (https://beerswift.app/tabs/tab3) bringing the user to the Tab3 page.\n+\n+<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vadlZ-d8wAI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n+\n+## Prerequisites\n+\n+* A pre-configured [Capacitor app](/docs/getting-started).\n+* For iOS, enrollment in the Apple Developer Program.\n+\n+For illustrative purposes, https://beerswift.app will be used as the web app link.\n+\n+## Deep Link Routing using the Capacitor App API\n+\n+When the native app is opened after a deep link is clicked, the mobile OS doesn't automatically know where to route the user. This must be implemented within the app itself using the Capacitor [App API](../apis/app) on app startup.\n+\n+If your website and app paths don't match, you will need to implement more advanced url pattern matching (see [this guide](https://devdactic.com/universal-links-ionic/) for examples).
