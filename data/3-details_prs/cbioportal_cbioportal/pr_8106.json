This was done because at my institution we would like our production deployment to use a MySQL database that is provided by a DBaaS service that we have which creates databases on non-default ports (instead of using a containerized database).\n\nChecks\n\n Runs on heroku\n Has tests or has a separate issue that describes the types of test that should be created. If no test is included it should explicitly be mentioned in the PR why there is no test.\n The commit log is comprehensible. It follows 7 rules of great commit messages. For most PRs a single commit should suffice, in some cases multiple topical commits can be useful. During review it is ok to see tiny commits (e.g. Fix reviewer comments), but right before the code gets merged to master or rc branch, any such commits should be squashed since they are useless to the other developers. Definitely avoid merge commits, use rebase instead.\n Is this PR adding logic based on one or more clinical attributes? If yes, please make sure validation for this attribute is also present in the data validation / data loading layers (in backend repo) and documented in File-Formats Clinical data section!\n\nAny screenshots or GIFs?\nIf this is a new visual feature please add a before/after screenshot or gif\nhere with e.g. Giphy CAPTURE or Peek\nNotify reviewers\nRead our Pull request merging\npolicy.
