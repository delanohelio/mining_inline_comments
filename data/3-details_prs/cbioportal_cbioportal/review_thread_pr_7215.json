If the gene has samples whose expression values are Null, NaN or 'NA', then its normalized expression is reported as NA.\n+\n+Otherwise when valid expression values exist, with both profiles, for every sample, the gene's normalized expression is reported as\n \n ```\n (r - mu)/sigma\n ```\n \n-where `r` is the raw expression value, and `mu` and `sigma` are the mean and standard deviation of the unaltered distribution, respectively.\n+where `r` is the raw expression value, and `mu` and `sigma` are the mean and standard deviation of the base population, respectively.\n+\n+### How to proceed\n+cBioPortal expects z-score normalization to take place per gene. You can produce this extra z-score file yourself, or let cBioPortal do it for your input files by using `convertExpressionZscores.pl` (Method 1, diploid samples as base population) OR `NormalizeExpressionLevels.py` (Method 2, all samples as base population). Examples of the calculation and running the programs are below.\n \n ## Parameters\n \n+### `convertExpressionZscores.pl`\n+\n `<copy_number_file> <expression_file> <output_file> <normal_sample_suffix> <[min_number_of_diploids]>`\n \n - `<copy_number_file>` : the [discrete copy number (CNA) file](File-Formats.md#discrete-copy-number-data) \n - `<expression_file>` : the [expression (exp) data file](File-Formats.md#expression-data). \n - `<output_file>` : the output file to be generated\n - `<normal_sample_suffix>` : use this to identify which of your samples are \"normal\" samples (if any). E.g. normal TCGA samples have a suffix \"-11\". Set it to some dummy value, e.g. \"NONE\", if you have no normal samples in your data.\n \n-## convertExpressionZscores Transformation Algorithm\u00a0\n+### `NormalizeExpressionLevels.py`\n+\n+`-i <expression_file> -o <output_file>`\n+\n+- `<expression_file>` : the [expression (exp) data file](File-Formats.md#expression-data).\n+- `<output_file>` : the output file to be generated\n+- We require the mRNA expression data to be log transformed before calculating zscores on them.
