I created a specific issue at #1799\nThe challenge he is that we take a Publisher<T> and turn it into a Publish<CompleteableFuture<T>>\nWith the values being async we can call onComplete before the values themselves have been received and processed.\nThis queues outstanding CFs so that when they complete they will call a runnable to complete / onerror IF they are yet to complete.\nThe size of the queue is the rate at which they arrive and don't get completed by the graphql layer call and also a function of the \"subscribe\" number that the person provides", "createdAt": "2020-02-28T05:49:54Z", "url": "https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/1801", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "15fb701ecaf972021dd485b4e6509114e9113236"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-05-20T22:48:46Z", "author": {"login": "bbakerman"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABcIpMqggH2gAyMzgxMjE1MTkzOjJhODJmMjkwZjg0NWQ1NjE0M2M5YTkzMzY4YTJjM2JlZmVhNGZhOTc=", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABcIp1LSAFqTM2NjE4MDczMA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "2a82f290f845d56143c9a93368a2c3befea4fa97", "author": {"user": {"login": "bbakerman", "name": "Brad Baker"}}, "url": "https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/commit/2a82f290f845d56143c9a93368a2c3befea4fa97", "committedDate": "2020-02-28T05:37:25Z", "message": "This fixes the Subscription publisher so that it does not drop values that have been received but not yet mapped by the graphql layer"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3MzY2MTgwNzMw", "url": "https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/1801#pullrequestreview-366180730", "createdAt": "2020-02-28T06:21:40Z", "commit": {"oid": "2a82f290f845d56143c9a93368a2c3befea4fa97"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMi0yOFQwNjoyMTo0MFrOFvqkgQ==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMi0yOFQwNjoyMTo0MFrOFvqkgQ==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4NTUyNDg2NQ==", "bodyText": "I did real TDD on this test.
