However, RPC shuffle\n+also requires all the producers and consumers to be executed concurrently until the\n+query is finished.\n+\n+To illustrates this, consider the aggregation query:\n+\n+.. code-block:: sql\n+\n+    SELECT custkey, SUM(totalprice)\n+    FROM orders\n+    GROUP BY custkey\n+\n+\n+The following figure demonstrates how this query executes in Presto classic mode:\n+\n+.. figure:: ../images/rpc_shuffle_execution.png\n+   :align: center\n+\n+With exchange materialization, the intermediate shuffle data is written to disk (currently,\n+it is always a temporary Hive bucketed table). This opens the opportunity for flexible scheduling policies\n+on the aggregation side, as only a subset of aggregation data needs to be held in memory at the\n+same time -- this execution strategy is called \"grouped execution\" in Presto.\n+\n+.. figure:: ../images/materialized_shuffle_execution.png\n+   :align: center\n+\n+Using Exchange Materialization\n+------------------------------\n+\n+Exchange materialization can be enabled on per-query basis by setting the following 3 session properties:\n+``exchange_materialization_strategy``, ``partitioning_provider_catalog`` and ``hash_partition_count``:\n+\n+.. code-block:: sql\n+\n+    SET SESSION exchange_materialization_strategy='ALL';\n+\n+    -- Set partitioning_provider_catalog to the Hive connector catalog\n+    SET SESSION partitioning_provider_catalog='hive';\n+\n+    -- We recommend setting hash_partition_count to be at least 5X-10X about the number of cluster size", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "0506a66de6de0de49aeaef14da9bb7262a468802"}, "originalPosition": 52}]}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 3685, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-13T12:26:42Z"}}}
