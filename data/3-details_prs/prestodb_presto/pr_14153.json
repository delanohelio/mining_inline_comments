Whitelist is applied before blacklist.\n+   * Filter out queries with invalid syntax.\n+   * Filter out queries not supported for validation. ``Select``, ``Insert``, and ``CreateTableAsSelect`` are supported.\n+\n+* **Query rewriting**\n+    * Rewrite queries before execution to ensure that production data is not modified.\n+    * Rewrite ``Select`` queries to ``CreateTableAsSelect``\n+       * Column names are determined by running the ``Select`` query with ``LIMIT 0``.\n+       * Artificial name are used for unnamed columns.\n+    * Rewrite ``Insert`` and ``CreateTableAsSelect`` queries to have their table names replaced.\n+       * Construct a setup query to create the table necessary for a ``Insert`` query.\n+\n+* **Query Execution**\n+    * Conceptually, Verifier is configured with a control cluster and a test cluster. However, they\n+      may be pointed to the same Presto cluster for certain tests.\n+    * For each source query, execute the following queries in order.\n+        * Control setup queries\n+        * Control query\n+        * Test setup queries\n+        * Test query\n+        * Control and Test teardown\n+    * Queries are subject to timeouts and retries.\n+        * Cluster connection failures and transient Presto failures are retried.\n+        * Query retries may conceal reliability issues. All occurred Presto query failures, including the retries ones, are recorded.\n+    * Certain query failures are automatically submitted for re-validation, such as partition dropped or table dropped during query.\n+    * See `Failure Resolution`_ for automatic resolving query failures.\n+\n+* **Results Comparison**\n+    * For ``Select``, ``Insert``, and ``CreateTableAsSelect`` queries, results are written into temporary tables.\n+    * Construct and run the checksum queries for both control and test.\n+    * Verify table schema and row count are the same for the control and the test result table.\n+    * Verify checksums are matching for each column. See `Column Checksums`_ for special handling of different column types.\n+    * See `Determinism`_ for handling of non-deterministic queries.\n+\n+* **Emitting Results**\n+    * Verification results can be exported as ``JSON``, or human readable text.\n+\n+Column Checksums\n+----------------\n+For each column in the control/test query, one or more columns maybe generated in the checksum\n+queries.\n+\n+* **Floating Point Columns**\n+    * For ``DOUBLE`` and ``REAL`` columns, 4 columns are generated for verification:\n+       * Sum of the finite values of the column\n+       * ``NAN`` count of the column\n+       * Positive infinity count of the column\n+       * Negative infinity count of the column\n+    * Check if ``NAN`` count, positive and negative infinity count matches.\n+    * Check the nullity of control sum and test sum.\n+    * If either control mean or test mean very close 0, check if both are close to 0.\n+    * Check the relative error between control sum and test sum.\n+* **Array Columns**\n+    * 2 columns are generated for verification:\n+       * Sum of the cardinality\n+       * Array checksum\n+    * For an array column ``arr`` of type ``array(E)``:\n+       * If ``E`` is not orderable, array checksum is ``checksum(arr)``.\n+       * If ``E`` is orderable, array checksum ``coalesce(checksum(try(array_sort(arr))), checksum(arr))``.\n+* **Map Columns**\n+    * 4 columns are generated for verification:\n+       * Sum of the cardinality\n+       * Checksum of the map\n+       * Array checksum of the kep set\n+       * Array checksum of the value set\n+* **Row Columns**\n+    * Checksum row fields recursively, as according to the type of the fields.\n+* For all other column types, generate a simple checksum using the :func:`checksum` function.\n+\n+Determinism\n+-----------\n+A result mismatch, either a row count mismatch or a column mismatch, can be caused by\n+non-deterministic query features. To avoid false alerts, we perform determinism analysis\n+for the control query. If a query is found non-deterministic, we skip the verification as it\n+does not provide insights.\n+\n+Determinism analysis follows the following steps. If a query is found non-deterministic at any\n+point, the analysis will conclude.\n+\n+* A list of non-deterministic catalogs can be specified. If a query references any table from a\n+  non-deterministic catalog, the query is considered non-deterministic.\n+* Run the control query again, and the compare the results with the initial control query run.\n+* If a query has a ``LIMIT n`` clause but no ``ORDER BY`` clause at the top level:\n+   * Run a query to count the number of rows produced by the control query without the ``LIMIT`` clause.\n+   * If the resulting row count is greater than ``n``, treat the control query as non-deterministic.\n+\n+Failure Resolution\n+------------------\n+The difference in configuration, including cluster size, can cause a query to succeed on the\n+control cluster but fail on the test cluster. A checksum query can also fail, which may be due to\n+limitation of Presto or Presto Verifier. Thus, we allow Verifier to automatically resolve certain\n+query failures.\n+\n+* ``EXCEEDED_GLOBAL_MEMORY_LIMIT``: Resolve if the control query uses more memory than the test query.\n+* ``EXCEEDED_TIME_LIMIT``: Resolve unconditionally.\n+* ``TOO_MANY_HIVE_PARTITIONS``: Resolve if the test cluster do not have enough worker to make sure the\n+  number of partitions assigned to each worker stays within the limit.\n+* ``COMPILER_ERROR``: Resolve if checksum fails with this error. If a control query has too many\n+  columns, generated checksum query might be too large in certain cases.\n+\n+Extending Verifier\n+------------------\n+\n+Verifier can be extended for further behavioral changes in additional to configuration properties.\n+\n+`AbstractVerifyCommand <https://github.com/prestodb/presto/blob/master/presto-verifier/src/main/java/com/facebook/presto/verifier/framework/AbstractVerifyCommand.java>`_\n+shows the components that be extended.

Whitelist is applied before blacklist.\n+   * Filter out queries with invalid syntax.\n+   * Filter out queries not supported for validation. ``Select``, ``Insert``, and ``CreateTableAsSelect`` are supported.\n+\n+* **Query rewriting**\n+    * Rewrite queries before execution to ensure that production data is not modified.\n+    * Rewrite ``Select`` queries to ``CreateTableAsSelect``\n+       * Column names are determined by running the ``Select`` query with ``LIMIT 0``.\n+       * Artificial names are used for unnamed columns.\n+    * Rewrite ``Insert`` and ``CreateTableAsSelect`` queries to have their table names replaced.\n+       * Construct a setup query to create the table necessary for an ``Insert`` query.\n+\n+* **Query Execution**\n+    * Conceptually, Verifier is configured with a control cluster and a test cluster. However, they\n+      may be pointed to the same Presto cluster for certain tests.\n+    * For each source query, execute the following queries in order.\n+        * Control setup queries\n+        * Control query\n+        * Test setup queries\n+        * Test query\n+        * Control and Test teardown\n+    * Queries are subject to timeouts and retries.\n+        * Cluster connection failures and transient Presto failures are retried.\n+        * Query retries may conceal reliability issues. All occurred Presto query failures, including the retries, are recorded.\n+    * Certain query failures are automatically submitted for re-validation, such as partition dropped or table dropped during query.\n+    * See `Failure Resolution`_ for auto-resolving of query failures.\n+\n+* **Results Comparison**\n+    * For ``Select``, ``Insert``, and ``CreateTableAsSelect`` queries, results are written into temporary tables.\n+    * Construct and run the checksum queries for both control and test.\n+    * Verify table schema and row count are the same for the control and the test result table.\n+    * Verify checksums are matching for each column. See `Column Checksums`_ for special handling of different column types.\n+    * See `Determinism`_ for handling of non-deterministic queries.\n+\n+* **Emitting Results**\n+    * Verification results can be exported as ``JSON``, or human readable text.\n+\n+Column Checksums\n+----------------\n+For each column in the control/test query, one or more columns are generated in the checksum\n+queries.\n+\n+* **Floating Point Columns**\n+    * For ``DOUBLE`` and ``REAL`` columns, 4 columns are generated for verification:\n+       * Sum of the finite values of the column\n+       * ``NAN`` count of the column\n+       * Positive infinity count of the column\n+       * Negative infinity count of the column\n+    * Check if ``NAN`` count, positive and negative infinity count matches.\n+    * Check the nullity of control sum and test sum.\n+    * If either control mean or test mean very close 0, check if both are close to 0.\n+    * Check the relative error between control sum and test sum.\n+* **Array Columns**\n+    * 2 columns are generated for verification:\n+       * Sum of the cardinality\n+       * Array checksum\n+    * For an array column ``arr`` of type ``array(E)``:\n+       * If ``E`` is not orderable, array checksum is ``checksum(arr)``.\n+       * If ``E`` is orderable, array checksum ``coalesce(checksum(try(array_sort(arr))), checksum(arr))``.\n+* **Map Columns**\n+    * 4 columns are generated for verification:\n+       * Sum of the cardinality\n+       * Checksum of the map\n+       * Array checksum of the key set\n+       * Array checksum of the value set\n+* **Row Columns**\n+    * Checksum row fields recursively according to the type of the fields.\n+* For all other column types, generate a simple checksum using the :func:`checksum` function.\n+\n+Determinism\n+-----------\n+A result mismatch, either a row count mismatch or a column mismatch, can be caused by\n+non-deterministic query features. To avoid false alerts, we perform determinism analysis\n+for the control query. If a query is found non-deterministic, we skip the verification as it\n+does not provide insights.\n+\n+Determinism analysis follows the following steps. If a query is found non-deterministic at any\n+point, the analysis will conclude.\n+\n+* Non-deterministic catalogs can be specified with ``determinism.non-deterministic-catalog``.\n+  If a query references any table from those catalogs, the query is considered non-deterministic.\n+* Run the control query again and compare the results with the initial control query run.\n+* If a query has a ``LIMIT n`` clause but no ``ORDER BY`` clause at the top level:\n+   * Run a query to count the number of rows produced by the control query without the ``LIMIT`` clause.\n+   * If the resulting row count is greater than ``n``, treat the control query as non-deterministic.\n+\n+Failure Resolution\n+------------------\n+The difference in configuration, including cluster size, can cause a query to succeed on the\n+control cluster but fail on the test cluster. A checksum query can also fail, which may be due to\n+limitation of Presto or Presto Verifier. Thus, we allow Verifier to automatically resolve certain\n+query failures.\n+\n+* ``EXCEEDED_GLOBAL_MEMORY_LIMIT``: Resolve if the control query uses more memory than the test\n+  query.\n+* ``EXCEEDED_TIME_LIMIT``: Resolve unconditionally.\n+* ``TOO_MANY_HIVE_PARTITIONS``: Resolve if the test cluster does not have enough workers to make\n+  sure the number of partitions assigned to each worker stays within the limit.\n+* ``COMPILER_ERROR``: Resolve if checksum fails with this error. If a control query has too many\n+  columns, generated checksum query might be too large in certain cases.\n+\n+Extending Verifier\n+------------------\n+\n+Verifier can be extended for further behavioral changes in additional to configuration properties.\n+\n+`AbstractVerifyCommand <https://github.com/prestodb/presto/blob/master/presto-verifier/src/main/java/com/facebook/presto/verifier/framework/AbstractVerifyCommand.java>`_\n+shows the components that be extended.
