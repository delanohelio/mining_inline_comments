The delay starts after all tasks have been successfully stopped on the TaskManagers, and once the delay is past, the tasks are re-started. This parameter is useful to delay re-execution in order to let certain time-out related failures surface fully (like broken connections that have not fully timed out), before attempting a re-execution and immediately failing again due to the same problem.
