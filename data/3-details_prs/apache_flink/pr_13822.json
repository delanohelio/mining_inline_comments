"Dependencies:\n\n#13821\n#13866\n#13878\n\nWhat is the purpose of the change\nThe emitted event would allow to tear down \"virtual channels\" used to read channel state on recovery with unaligned checkpoints and rescaling.\nUpstream subpartitions are blocked upon sending this event and unblocked by the downstream when all channels receive it.\nVerifying this change\n\nAdded ChannelPersistenceITCase.testUpstreamBlocksAfterRecoveringState to test emission and blocking on the upstream side\nAdded CheckpointedInputGateTest to test alignment and unblocking on the downstream side\n\nDoes this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\n\nDependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\nThe public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with @Public(Evolving): no\nThe serializers: no\nThe runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\nAnything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing,
