(there is a second try-catch block) Or could > it happen that no exception is thrown at all?\n\nYeah, I understand your concern. Actually this test covers the following scenarios:\n\n\nFirst: IO thread inserts the buffer into channel queue, Second: canceler thread releases the channel to recycle the queued buffer. Without exception in this case.\n\n\nFirst: Canceler thread releases the channel, Second: IO thread tries to insert the buffer into channel queue. But it would check the released state and then recycle the filled buffer by IO thread. Without exception in this case.\n\n\nFirst: IO thread consumes all the available buffers while reading states and blocks on waiting for buffers. Second: canceler thread releases the channel and awake the IO thread. Then IO thread will check the isReleased state and then throw CancelTaskException.\n\n\nFirst: Canceler thread releases the channel, Second: IO thread requests buffer but does not get available buffer because of released channel, then it will check the isReleased state and throw CancelTaskException. The difference with above is that the IO thread is not awaked by canceler thread.\n\n\nMaybe there are also some other cases besides above. So if we want to get determined results, we need to design different separate tests for fine-grained scenarios, and I am not quite sure whether it is easy to control the logics among different processes. And it might be more fragile future if we change the related processes because we touch the fine-grained logics.\nFrom another aspect, the overall scenario is that while IO thread recovering state, the canceler thread is releasing the channel. As long as we construct this scenario, we do not need to touch the fine-grained logics inside every process, somehow like the ITCase as @pnowojski said above. And finally we only need to guarantee there are no deadlock and buffer leaks in the result and ignores the intermediate results.\n\nIf this is non-deterministic, would it make sense to repeatedly execute the test? The test is rather fast on my machine.\n\nI think it is hard to give a proper loop number to guarantee which action will be executed among these threads, then it might cause more fragile cases.
