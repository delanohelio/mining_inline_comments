The default `RecordPublisher` is `POLLING`.\n+- `EFO_CONSUMER_NAME`: A name to identify the consumer. \n+For a given Kinesis data stream, each consumer must have a unique name. \n+However, consumer names do not have to be unique across data streams. \n+Reusing a consumer name will result in existing subscriptions being terminated.\n+\n+The code snippet below shows a simple example configurating an EFO consumer.\n+\n+<div class=\"codetabs\" markdown=\"1\">\n+<div data-lang=\"java\" markdown=\"1\">\n+{% highlight java %}\n+Properties consumerConfig = new Properties();\n+consumerConfig.put(AWSConfigConstants.AWS_REGION, \"us-east-1\");\n+consumerConfig.put(ConsumerConfigConstants.STREAM_INITIAL_POSITION, \"LATEST\");\n+\n+consumerConfig.put(ConsumerConfigConstants.RECORD_PUBLISHER_TYPE, \n+    ConsumerConfigConstants.RecordPublisherType.EFO.name());\n+consumerConfig.put(ConsumerConfigConstants.EFO_CONSUMER_NAME, \"my-flink-efo-consumer\");\n+\n+StreamExecutionEnvironment env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment();\n+\n+DataStream<String> kinesis = env.addSource(new FlinkKinesisConsumer<>(\n+    \"kinesis_stream_name\", new SimpleStringSchema(), consumerConfig));\n+{% endhighlight %}\n+</div>\n+<div data-lang=\"scala\" markdown=\"1\">\n+{% highlight scala %}\n+val consumerConfig = new Properties()\n+consumerConfig.put(AWSConfigConstants.AWS_REGION, \"us-east-1\")\n+consumerConfig.put(ConsumerConfigConstants.STREAM_INITIAL_POSITION, \"LATEST\")\n+\n+consumerConfig.put(ConsumerConfigConstants.RECORD_PUBLISHER_TYPE, \n+    ConsumerConfigConstants.RecordPublisherType.EFO.name());\n+consumerConfig.put(ConsumerConfigConstants.EFO_CONSUMER_NAME, \"my-flink-efo-consumer\");\n+\n+val env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment()\n+\n+val kinesis = env.addSource(new FlinkKinesisConsumer[String](\n+    \"kinesis_stream_name\", new SimpleStringSchema, consumerConfig))\n+{% endhighlight %}\n+</div>\n+</div>\n+\n+#### EFO Stream Consumer Registration/Deregistration\n+\n+In order to use EFO, a stream consumer must be registered against each stream you wish to consume.\n+By default, the `FlinkKinesisConsumer` will register the stream consumer automatically when the Flink job starts.\n+The stream consumer will be registered using the name provided by the `EFO_CONSUMER_NAME` configuration.\n+`FlinkKinesisConsumer` provides three registration strategies:\n+\n+- Registration\n+  - `LAZY` (default): Stream consumers are registered when the Flink job starts running.\n+    If the stream consumer already exists, it will be reused.\n+    This is the preferred strategy for the majority of applications.\n+    However, jobs with parallelism greater than 1 will result in tasks competing to register and acquire the stream consumer ARN.\n+    For jobs with very large parallelism this can result in an increased start-up time.\n+    The describe operation has a limit of 20 [transactions per second](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeStreamConsumer.html),\n+    this means application startup time will increase by roughly `parallelism/20 seconds`.\n+  - `EAGER`: Stream consumers are registered in the `FlinkKinesisConstructor`.\n+    If the stream consumer already exists, it will be reused. \n+    This will result in registration occurring when the job is constructed, \n+    either on the Flink Job Manager or client environment submitting the job.\n+    Using this strategy results in a single thread registering and retrieving the stream consumer ARN, \n+    reducing startup time over `LAZY` (with large parallelism).\n+    However, consider that the client environment will require access to the AWS services.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "69e9e79df723588ae633abd4cce71c2386ca15c9"}, "originalPosition": 87}]}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 530, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-12T11:18:39Z"}}}
