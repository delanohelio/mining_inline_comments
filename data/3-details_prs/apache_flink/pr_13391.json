That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)\nBrief change log\n(for example:)\n\nThe TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact\nDeployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference\nTaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache\n\nVerifying this change\n(Please pick either of the following options)\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\n(or)\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as (please describe tests).\n(or)\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\n(example:)\n\nAdded integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)\nExtended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure\nAdded test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries\nManually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.\n\nDoes this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\n\nDependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\nThe public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with @Public(Evolving): (yes / no)\nThe serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\nThe runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\nAnything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\nThe S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\n\nDocumentation\n\nDoes this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\nIf yes, how is the feature documented?
