The reason is that we already have a different ResultPartitionType (Pipelined_Approximate). Put the difference in the class implementation (PipelinedApproximateSubpartition.java) reminds us this is another place where Pipelined_Approximate is different from Pipelined(_bounded). Indeed we probably would have different implementations of channel restore for Pipelined_Approximate (for now, it is just do nothing).\nI was leaning to think of it as a different implementation instead of disabling the feature.\nThere are some other places where unaligned checkpoints are not compatible with approximate failover,  not just rescaling.\nThe check of \"approximate failover\" vs \"unaligned checkpoint\" not be enabled at the same time will is added in the PR Till is reviewing right now. It is added when ResultPartitionType is decided.", "url": "https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/13928#discussion_r517785523", "createdAt": "2020-11-05T04:27:26Z", "author": {"login": "curcur"}, "path": "flink-runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/runtime/io/network/partition/PipelinedApproximateSubpartition.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -92,6 +94,11 @@ private void releaseView() {\n \t\t}\n \t}\n \n+\t@Override\n+\tpublic void finishReadRecoveredState(boolean notifyAndBlockOnCompletion) throws IOException {\n+\t\t// The Approximate Local Recovery can not work with unaligned checkpoint for now, so no need to recover channel state", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxNzQzMDg4Mg=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "f308cc5d04866c3edeb95dacc3f2a1994144c8ab"}, "originalPosition": 15}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxNzg4ODk3NA==", "bodyText": "Hey @curcur , thanks for the explanation.\nI approved the changes.", "url": "https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/13928#discussion_r517888974", "createdAt": "2020-11-05T09:00:04Z", "author": {"login": "rkhachatryan"}, "path": "flink-runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/runtime/io/network/partition/PipelinedApproximateSubpartition.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -92,6 +94,11 @@ private void releaseView() {\n \t\t}\n \t}\n \n+\t@Override\n+\tpublic void finishReadRecoveredState(boolean notifyAndBlockOnCompletion) throws IOException {\n+\t\t// The Approximate Local Recovery can not work with unaligned checkpoint for now, so no need to recover channel state", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxNzQzMDg4Mg=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "f308cc5d04866c3edeb95dacc3f2a1994144c8ab"}, "originalPosition": 15}]}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 4928, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-12T11:57:46Z"}}}
