Hadoop may consume more direct or native memory in certain setups.\n+\n+<span class=\"label label-info\">Note</span> Neither heap nor off-heap versions of framework and task memory are currently isolated within Flink.\n+The separation of framework and task memory can be used in future releases for further optimizations.\n+\n+## Capped Fractionated Components\n+\n+This section describes the

|\n+{:.table-bordered}\n+<br/>\n+\n+As you can see, the size of some memory components can be simply set by the respective option.\n+Other components can be tuned using multiple options.\n+\n+## Framework Memory\n+\n+The *framework heap memory* and *framework off-heap memory* options are not supposed to be changed without a good reason.\n+Adjust them only if you are sure that Flink needs more memory for some internal data structures or operations.\n+It can be related to a particular deployment environment or job structure, like high parallelism.\n+In addition, Flink dependencies, such as Hadoop may consume more direct or native memory in certain setups.\n+\n+<span class=\"label label-info\">Note</span> Neither heap nor off-heap versions of framework and task memory are currently isolated within Flink.\n+The separation of framework and task memory can be used in future releases for further optimizations.\n+\n+## Capped Fractionated Components\n+\n+This section describes the configuration details of the following options which can be a fraction of a certain\n+[total memory](mem_setup.html#configure-total-memory):\n+\n+* *Network memory* can be a fraction of the *total Flink memory*\n+* *JVM overhead* can be a fraction of the *total process memory*\n+\n+See also [detailed memory model](#overview).\n+\n+The size of those components always has to be between its maximum and minimum value, otherwise Flink startup will fail.\n+The maximum and minimum values have defaults or can be explicitly set by corresponding configuration options.\n+For example, if only the following memory options are set:\n+- total Flink memory = 1000Mb,\n+- network min = 64Mb,\n+- network max = 128Mb,\n+- network fraction = 0.1\n+\n+then the network memory will be 1000Mb x 0.1 = 100Mb which is within the range 64-128Mb.\n+\n+Notice if you configure the same maximum and minimum value it effectively means that its size is fixed to that value.\n+\n+If the component memory is not explicitly configured, then Flink will use the fraction to calculate the memory size\n+based on the total memory. The calculated value is capped by its corresponding min/max options.\n+For example, if only the following memory options are set:\n+- total Flink memory = 1000Mb,\n+- network min = 128Mb,\n+- network max = 256Mb,\n+- network fraction = 0.1\n+\n+then the network memory will be 128Mb because the size derived from fraction is 100Mb and it is less than the minimum.\n+\n+It can also happen that the fraction is ignored if the sizes of the total memory and its other components are defined.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "e34dafad44cbd3eb8cc62b0e0436f096a8f95db6"}, "originalPosition": 100}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMjMyOTczNTYzOnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "docs/ops/memory/mem_detail.md", "isResolved": false, "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMi0wN1QyMzozNDowOVrOFnNQUQ==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMi0wN1QyMzozNDowOVrOFnNQUQ==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3NjY1NTk1Mw==", "bodyText": "This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

Framework Memory\n+\n+The *framework heap memory* and *framework off-heap memory* options are not supposed to be changed without a good reason.\n+Adjust them only if you are sure that Flink needs more memory for some internal data structures or operations.\n+It can be related to a particular deployment environment or job structure, like high parallelism.\n+In addition, Flink dependencies, such as Hadoop may consume more direct or native memory in certain setups.\n+\n+<span class=\"label label-info\">Note</span> Neither heap nor off-heap versions of framework and task memory are currently isolated within Flink.\n+The separation of framework and task memory can be used in future releases for further optimizations.\n+\n+## Capped Fractionated Components\n+\n+This section describes the configuration details of the following options which can be a fraction of a certain\n+[total memory](mem_setup.html#configure-total-memory):\n+\n+* *Network memory* can be a fraction of the *total Flink memory*\n+* *JVM overhead* can be a fraction of the *total process memory*\n+\n+See also [detailed memory model](#overview).\n+\n+The size of those components always has to be between its maximum and minimum value, otherwise Flink startup will fail.\n+The maximum and minimum values have defaults or can be explicitly set by corresponding configuration options.\n+For example, if only the following memory options are set:\n+- total Flink memory = 1000Mb,\n+- network min = 64Mb,\n+- network max = 128Mb,\n+- network fraction = 0.1\n+\n+then the network memory will be 1000Mb x 0.1 = 100Mb which is within the range 64-128Mb.\n+\n+Notice if you configure the same maximum and minimum value it effectively means that its size is fixed to that value.\n+\n+If the component memory is not explicitly configured, then Flink will use the fraction to calculate the memory size\n+based on the total memory. The calculated value is capped by its corresponding min/max options.\n+For example, if only the following memory options are set:\n+- total Flink memory = 1000Mb,\n+- network min = 128Mb,\n+- network max = 256Mb,\n+- network fraction = 0.1\n+\n+then the network memory will be 128Mb because the size derived from fraction is 100Mb and it is less than the minimum.\n+\n+It can also happen that the fraction is ignored if the sizes of the total memory and its other components are defined.\n+In this case, the network memory is the rest of the total memory. The derived value still has to be within its min/max\n+range otherwise the configuration fails. For example, suppose only the following memory options are set:\n+- total Flink memory = 1000Mb,\n+- task heap = 100Mb,\n+- network min = 64Mb,\n+- network max = 256Mb,\n+- network fraction = 0.1\n+\n+All other components of the total Flink memory have default values, including the default managed memory fraction.\n+Then the network memory is not the fraction (1000Mb x 0.1 = 100Mb) but the rest of the total Flink memory\n+which will either be within the range 64-256Mb or fail.\n+\n+## JVM Parameters\n+\n+Flink explicitly adds the following memory related JVM arguments while starting the task executor process,\n+based on the configured or derived memory component sizes:\n+\n+| &nbsp;&nbsp;**JVM Arguments**&nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp;**Value**&nbsp;&nbsp;          |\n+| :---------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |\n+| *-Xmx* and *-Xms*                         | Framework + Task Heap Memory               |\n+| *-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize*                 | Framework + Task Off-Heap + Network Memory |\n+| *-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize*                    | JVM Metaspace                              |\n+{:.table-bordered}\n+<br/>\n+\n+See also [detailed memory model](#overview).\n+\n+## Local Execution\n+If you start Flink locally on your machine as a single java program without creating a cluster (e.g. from your IDE)", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "e34dafad44cbd3eb8cc62b0e0436f096a8f95db6"}, "originalPosition": 129}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMjMyOTczODQzOnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "docs/ops/memory/mem_detail.md", "isResolved": false, "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMi0wN1QyMzozNjowN1rOFnNSHw==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMi0wN1QyMzozNjowN1rOFnNSHw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3NjY1NjQxNQ==", "bodyText": "This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

|\n+{:.table-bordered}\n+<br/>\n+\n+As you can see, the size of some memory components can be simply set by the respective option.\n+Other components can be tuned using multiple options.\n+\n+## Framework Memory\n+\n+The *framework heap memory* and *framework off-heap memory* options are not supposed to be changed without a good reason.\n+Adjust them only if you are sure that Flink needs more memory for some internal data structures or operations.\n+It can be related to a particular deployment environment or job structure, like high parallelism.\n+In addition, Flink dependencies, such as Hadoop may consume more direct or native memory in certain setups.\n+\n+<span class=\"label label-info\">Note</span> Neither heap nor off-heap versions of framework and task memory are currently isolated within Flink.\n+The separation of framework and task memory can be used in future releases for further optimizations.\n+\n+## Capped Fractionated Components\n+\n+This section describes the configuration details of the following options which can be a fraction of a certain\n+[total memory](mem_setup.html#configure-total-memory):\n+\n+* *Network memory* can be a fraction of the *total Flink memory*\n+* *JVM overhead* can be a fraction of the *total process memory*\n+\n+See also [detailed memory model](#overview).\n+\n+The size of those components always has to be between its maximum and minimum value, otherwise Flink startup will fail.\n+The maximum and minimum values have defaults or can be explicitly set by corresponding configuration options.\n+For example, if only the following memory options are set:\n+- total Flink memory = 1000Mb,\n+- network min = 64Mb,\n+- network max = 128Mb,\n+- network fraction = 0.1\n+\n+then the network memory will be 1000Mb x 0.1 = 100Mb which is within the range 64-128Mb.\n+\n+Notice if you configure the same maximum and minimum value it effectively means that its size is fixed to that value.\n+\n+If the component memory is not explicitly configured, then Flink will use the fraction to calculate the memory size\n+based on the total memory. The calculated value is capped by its corresponding min/max options.\n+For example, if only the following memory options are set:\n+- total Flink memory = 1000Mb,\n+- network min = 128Mb,\n+- network max = 256Mb,\n+- network fraction = 0.1\n+\n+then the network memory will be 128Mb because the size derived from fraction is 100Mb and it is less than the minimum.\n+\n+It can also happen that the fraction is ignored if the sizes of the total memory and its other components are defined.\n+In this case, the network memory is the rest of the total memory. The derived value still has to be within its min/max\n+range otherwise the configuration fails. For example, suppose only the following memory options are set:\n+- total Flink memory = 1000Mb,\n+- task heap = 100Mb,\n+- network min = 64Mb,\n+- network max = 256Mb,\n+- network fraction = 0.1\n+\n+All other components of the total Flink memory have default values, including the default managed memory fraction.\n+Then the network memory is not the fraction (1000Mb x 0.1 = 100Mb) but the rest of the total Flink memory\n+which will either be within the range 64-256Mb or fail.\n+\n+## JVM Parameters\n+\n+Flink explicitly adds the following memory related JVM arguments while starting the task executor process,\n+based on the configured or derived memory component sizes:\n+\n+| &nbsp;&nbsp;**JVM Arguments**&nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp;**Value**&nbsp;&nbsp;          |\n+| :---------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |\n+| *-Xmx* and *-Xms*                         | Framework + Task Heap Memory               |\n+| *-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize*                 | Framework + Task Off-Heap + Network Memory |\n+| *-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize*                    | JVM Metaspace                              |\n+{:.table-bordered}\n+<br/>\n+\n+See also [detailed memory model](#overview).\n+\n+## Local Execution\n+If you start Flink locally on your machine as a single java program without creating a cluster (e.g. from your IDE)\n+then all components are ignored except for the following:\n+\n+| &nbsp;&nbsp;**Memory component**&nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp;**Relevant options**&nbsp;&nbsp;                                                  | &nbsp;&nbsp;**Default value for the local execution**&nbsp;&nbsp;             |\n+| :------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n+| Task heap                                    | [`taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-heap-size)         | infinite                                                                      |\n+| Task off-heap                                | [`taskmanager.memory.task.off-heap.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-off-heap-size) | infinite                                                                      |\n+| Managed memory                               | [`taskmanager.memory.managed.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size)             | 128Mb                                                                         |\n+| Network memory                               | [`taskmanager.memory.network.min`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-network-min) <br /> [`taskmanager.memory.network.max`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-network-max) | 64Mb |\n+{:.table-bordered}\n+<br/>\n+\n+All of the components listed above can be but do not have to be explicitly configured for the local execution.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "e34dafad44cbd3eb8cc62b0e0436f096a8f95db6"}, "originalPosition": 141}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMjMyOTczOTA1OnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "docs/ops/memory/mem_detail.md", "isResolved": false, "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMi0wN1QyMzozNjozNFrOFnNSew==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMi0wN1QyMzozNjozNFrOFnNSew==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3NjY1NjUwNw==", "bodyText": "This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

|\n+{:.table-bordered}\n+<br/>\n+\n+As you can see, the size of some memory components can be simply set by the respective option.\n+Other components can be tuned using multiple options.\n+\n+## Framework Memory\n+\n+The *framework heap memory* and *framework off-heap memory* options are not supposed to be changed without a good reason.\n+Adjust them only if you are sure that Flink needs more memory for some internal data structures or operations.\n+It can be related to a particular deployment environment or job structure, like high parallelism.\n+In addition, Flink dependencies, such as Hadoop may consume more direct or native memory in certain setups.\n+\n+<span class=\"label label-info\">Note</span> Neither heap nor off-heap versions of framework and task memory are currently isolated within Flink.\n+The separation of framework and task memory can be used in future releases for further optimizations.\n+\n+## Capped Fractionated Components\n+\n+This section describes the configuration details of the following options which can be a fraction of a certain\n+[total memory](mem_setup.html#configure-total-memory):\n+\n+* *Network memory* can be a fraction of the *total Flink memory*\n+* *JVM overhead* can be a fraction of the *total process memory*\n+\n+See also [detailed memory model](#overview).\n+\n+The size of those components always has to be between its maximum and minimum value, otherwise Flink startup will fail.\n+The maximum and minimum values have defaults or can be explicitly set by corresponding configuration options.\n+For example, if only the following memory options are set:\n+- total Flink memory = 1000Mb,\n+- network min = 64Mb,\n+- network max = 128Mb,\n+- network fraction = 0.1\n+\n+then the network memory will be 1000Mb x 0.1 = 100Mb which is within the range 64-128Mb.\n+\n+Notice if you configure the same maximum and minimum value it effectively means that its size is fixed to that value.\n+\n+If the component memory is not explicitly configured, then Flink will use the fraction to calculate the memory size\n+based on the total memory. The calculated value is capped by its corresponding min/max options.\n+For example, if only the following memory options are set:\n+- total Flink memory = 1000Mb,\n+- network min = 128Mb,\n+- network max = 256Mb,\n+- network fraction = 0.1\n+\n+then the network memory will be 128Mb because the size derived from fraction is 100Mb and it is less than the minimum.\n+\n+It can also happen that the fraction is ignored if the sizes of the total memory and its other components are defined.\n+In this case, the network memory is the rest of the total memory. The derived value still has to be within its min/max\n+range otherwise the configuration fails. For example, suppose only the following memory options are set:\n+- total Flink memory = 1000Mb,\n+- task heap = 100Mb,\n+- network min = 64Mb,\n+- network max = 256Mb,\n+- network fraction = 0.1\n+\n+All other components of the total Flink memory have default values, including the default managed memory fraction.\n+Then the network memory is not the fraction (1000Mb x 0.1 = 100Mb) but the rest of the total Flink memory\n+which will either be within the range 64-256Mb or fail.\n+\n+## JVM Parameters\n+\n+Flink explicitly adds the following memory related JVM arguments while starting the task executor process,\n+based on the configured or derived memory component sizes:\n+\n+| &nbsp;&nbsp;**JVM Arguments**&nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp;**Value**&nbsp;&nbsp;          |\n+| :---------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |\n+| *-Xmx* and *-Xms*                         | Framework + Task Heap Memory               |\n+| *-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize*                 | Framework + Task Off-Heap + Network Memory |\n+| *-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize*                    | JVM Metaspace                              |\n+{:.table-bordered}\n+<br/>\n+\n+See also [detailed memory model](#overview).\n+\n+## Local Execution\n+If you start Flink locally on your machine as a single java program without creating a cluster (e.g. from your IDE)\n+then all components are ignored except for the following:\n+\n+| &nbsp;&nbsp;**Memory component**&nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp;**Relevant options**&nbsp;&nbsp;                                                  | &nbsp;&nbsp;**Default value for the local execution**&nbsp;&nbsp;             |\n+| :------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n+| Task heap                                    | [`taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-heap-size)         | infinite                                                                      |\n+| Task off-heap                                | [`taskmanager.memory.task.off-heap.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-off-heap-size) | infinite                                                                      |\n+| Managed memory                               | [`taskmanager.memory.managed.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size)             | 128Mb                                                                         |\n+| Network memory                               | [`taskmanager.memory.network.min`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-network-min) <br /> [`taskmanager.memory.network.max`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-network-max) | 64Mb |\n+{:.table-bordered}\n+<br/>\n+\n+All of the components listed above can be but do not have to be explicitly configured for the local execution.\n+If they are not configured they are set to their default values.

Framework Memory\n+\n+The *framework heap memory* and *framework off-heap memory* options are not supposed to be changed without a good reason.\n+Adjust them only if you are sure that Flink needs more memory for some internal data structures or operations.\n+It can be related to a particular deployment environment or job structure, like high parallelism.\n+In addition, Flink dependencies, such as Hadoop may consume more direct or native memory in certain setups.\n+\n+<span class=\"label label-info\">Note</span> Neither heap nor off-heap versions of framework and task memory are currently isolated within Flink.\n+The separation of framework and task memory can be used in future releases for further optimizations.\n+\n+## Capped Fractionated Components\n+\n+This section describes the configuration details of the following options which can be a fraction of a certain\n+[total memory](mem_setup.html#configure-total-memory):\n+\n+* *Network memory* can be a fraction of the *total Flink memory*\n+* *JVM overhead* can be a fraction of the *total process memory*\n+\n+See also [detailed memory model](#overview).\n+\n+The size of those components always has to be between its maximum and minimum value, otherwise Flink startup will fail.\n+The maximum and minimum values have defaults or can be explicitly set by corresponding configuration options.\n+For example, if only the following memory options are set:\n+- total Flink memory = 1000Mb,\n+- network min = 64Mb,\n+- network max = 128Mb,\n+- network fraction = 0.1\n+\n+then the network memory will be 1000Mb x 0.1 = 100Mb which is within the range 64-128Mb.\n+\n+Notice if you configure the same maximum and minimum value it effectively means that its size is fixed to that value.\n+\n+If the component memory is not explicitly configured, then Flink will use the fraction to calculate the memory size\n+based on the total memory. The calculated value is capped by its corresponding min/max options.\n+For example, if only the following memory options are set:\n+- total Flink memory = 1000Mb,\n+- network min = 128Mb,\n+- network max = 256Mb,\n+- network fraction = 0.1\n+\n+then the network memory will be 128Mb because the size derived from fraction is 100Mb and it is less than the minimum.\n+\n+It can also happen that the fraction is ignored if the sizes of the total memory and its other components are defined.\n+In this case, the network memory is the rest of the total memory. The derived value still has to be within its min/max\n+range otherwise the configuration fails. For example, suppose only the following memory options are set:\n+- total Flink memory = 1000Mb,\n+- task heap = 100Mb,\n+- network min = 64Mb,\n+- network max = 256Mb,\n+- network fraction = 0.1\n+\n+All other components of the total Flink memory have default values, including the default managed memory fraction.\n+Then the network memory is not the fraction (1000Mb x 0.1 = 100Mb) but the rest of the total Flink memory\n+which will either be within the range 64-256Mb or fail.\n+\n+## JVM Parameters\n+\n+Flink explicitly adds the following memory related JVM arguments while starting the task executor process,\n+based on the configured or derived memory component sizes:\n+\n+| &nbsp;&nbsp;**JVM Arguments**&nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp;**Value**&nbsp;&nbsp;          |\n+| :---------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |\n+| *-Xmx* and *-Xms*                         | Framework + Task Heap Memory               |\n+| *-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize*                 | Framework + Task Off-Heap + Network Memory |\n+| *-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize*                    | JVM Metaspace                              |\n+{:.table-bordered}\n+<br/>\n+\n+See also [detailed memory model](#overview).\n+\n+## Local Execution\n+If you start Flink locally on your machine as a single java program without creating a cluster (e.g. from your IDE)\n+then all components are ignored except for the following:\n+\n+| &nbsp;&nbsp;**Memory component**&nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp;**Relevant options**&nbsp;&nbsp;                                                  | &nbsp;&nbsp;**Default value for the local execution**&nbsp;&nbsp;             |\n+| :------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n+| Task heap                                    | [`taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-heap-size)         | infinite                                                                      |\n+| Task off-heap                                | [`taskmanager.memory.task.off-heap.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-off-heap-size) | infinite                                                                      |\n+| Managed memory                               | [`taskmanager.memory.managed.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size)             | 128Mb                                                                         |\n+| Network memory                               | [`taskmanager.memory.network.min`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-network-min) <br /> [`taskmanager.memory.network.max`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-network-max) | 64Mb |\n+{:.table-bordered}\n+<br/>\n+\n+All of the components listed above can be but do not have to be explicitly configured for the local execution.\n+If they are not configured they are set to their default values.

The calculated value is capped by its corresponding min/max options.\n+For example, if only the following memory options are set:\n+- total Flink memory = 1000Mb,\n+- network min = 128Mb,\n+- network max = 256Mb,\n+- network fraction = 0.1\n+\n+then the network memory will be 128Mb because the size derived from fraction is 100Mb and it is less than the minimum.\n+\n+It can also happen that the fraction is ignored if the sizes of the total memory and its other components are defined.\n+In this case, the network memory is the rest of the total memory. The derived value still has to be within its min/max\n+range otherwise the configuration fails. For example, suppose only the following memory options are set:\n+- total Flink memory = 1000Mb,\n+- task heap = 100Mb,\n+- network min = 64Mb,\n+- network max = 256Mb,\n+- network fraction = 0.1\n+\n+All other components of the total Flink memory have default values, including the default managed memory fraction.\n+Then the network memory is not the fraction (1000Mb x 0.1 = 100Mb) but the rest of the total Flink memory\n+which will either be within the range 64-256Mb or fail.\n+\n+## JVM Parameters\n+\n+Flink explicitly adds the following memory related JVM arguments while starting the task executor process,\n+based on the configured or derived memory component sizes:\n+\n+| &nbsp;&nbsp;**JVM Arguments**&nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp;**Value**&nbsp;&nbsp;          |\n+| :---------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |\n+| *-Xmx* and *-Xms*                         | Framework + Task Heap Memory               |\n+| *-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize*                 | Framework + Task Off-Heap + Network Memory |\n+| *-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize*                    | JVM Metaspace                              |\n+{:.table-bordered}\n+<br/>\n+\n+See also [detailed memory model](#overview).\n+\n+## Local Execution\n+If you start Flink locally on your machine as a single java program without creating a cluster (e.g. from your IDE)\n+then all components are ignored except for the following:\n+\n+| &nbsp;&nbsp;**Memory component**&nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp;**Relevant options**&nbsp;&nbsp;                                                  | &nbsp;&nbsp;**Default value for the local execution**&nbsp;&nbsp;             |\n+| :------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n+| Task heap                                    | [`taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-heap-size)         | infinite                                                                      |\n+| Task off-heap                                | [`taskmanager.memory.task.off-heap.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-off-heap-size) | infinite                                                                      |\n+| Managed memory                               | [`taskmanager.memory.managed.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size)             | 128Mb                                                                         |\n+| Network memory                               | [`taskmanager.memory.network.min`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-network-min) <br /> [`taskmanager.memory.network.max`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-network-max) | 64Mb |\n+{:.table-bordered}\n+<br/>\n+\n+All of the components listed above can be but do not have to be explicitly configured for the local execution.\n+If they are not configured they are set to their default values.

Framework Memory\n+\n+The *framework heap memory* and *framework off-heap memory* options are not supposed to be changed without a good reason.\n+Adjust them only if you are sure that Flink needs more memory for some internal data structures or operations.\n+It can be related to a particular deployment environment or job structure, like high parallelism.\n+In addition, Flink dependencies, such as Hadoop may consume more direct or native memory in certain setups.\n+\n+<span class=\"label label-info\">Note</span> Neither heap nor off-heap versions of framework and task memory are currently isolated within Flink.\n+The separation of framework and task memory can be used in future releases for further optimizations.\n+\n+## Capped Fractionated Components\n+\n+This section describes the configuration details of the following options which can be a fraction of a certain\n+[total memory](mem_setup.html#configure-total-memory):\n+\n+* *Network memory* can be a fraction of the *total Flink memory*\n+* *JVM overhead* can be a fraction of the *total process memory*\n+\n+See also [detailed memory model](#overview).\n+\n+The size of those components always has to be between its maximum and minimum value, otherwise Flink startup will fail.\n+The maximum and minimum values have defaults or can be explicitly set by corresponding configuration options.\n+For example, if only the following memory options are set:\n+- total Flink memory = 1000Mb,\n+- network min = 64Mb,\n+- network max = 128Mb,\n+- network fraction = 0.1\n+\n+then the network memory will be 1000Mb x 0.1 = 100Mb which is within the range 64-128Mb.\n+\n+Notice if you configure the same maximum and minimum value it effectively means that its size is fixed to that value.\n+\n+If the component memory is not explicitly configured, then Flink will use the fraction to calculate the memory size\n+based on the total memory. The calculated value is capped by its corresponding min/max options.\n+For example, if only the following memory options are set:\n+- total Flink memory = 1000Mb,\n+- network min = 128Mb,\n+- network max = 256Mb,\n+- network fraction = 0.1\n+\n+then the network memory will be 128Mb because the size derived from fraction is 100Mb and it is less than the minimum.\n+\n+It can also happen that the fraction is ignored if the sizes of the total memory and its other components are defined.\n+In this case, the network memory is the rest of the total memory. The derived value still has to be within its min/max\n+range otherwise the configuration fails. For example, suppose only the following memory options are set:\n+- total Flink memory = 1000Mb,\n+- task heap = 100Mb,\n+- network min = 64Mb,\n+- network max = 256Mb,\n+- network fraction = 0.1\n+\n+All other components of the total Flink memory have default values, including the default managed memory fraction.\n+Then the network memory is not the fraction (1000Mb x 0.1 = 100Mb) but the rest of the total Flink memory\n+which will either be within the range 64-256Mb or fail.\n+\n+## JVM Parameters\n+\n+Flink explicitly adds the following memory related JVM arguments while starting the task executor process,\n+based on the configured or derived memory component sizes:\n+\n+| &nbsp;&nbsp;**JVM Arguments**&nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp;**Value**&nbsp;&nbsp;          |\n+| :---------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |\n+| *-Xmx* and *-Xms*                         | Framework + Task Heap Memory               |\n+| *-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize*                 | Framework + Task Off-Heap + Network Memory |\n+| *-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize*                    | JVM Metaspace                              |\n+{:.table-bordered}\n+<br/>\n+\n+See also [detailed memory model](#overview).\n+\n+## Local Execution\n+If you start Flink locally on your machine as a single java program without creating a cluster (e.g. from your IDE)\n+then all components are ignored except for the following:\n+\n+| &nbsp;&nbsp;**Memory component**&nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp;**Relevant options**&nbsp;&nbsp;                                                  | &nbsp;&nbsp;**Default value for the local execution**&nbsp;&nbsp;             |\n+| :------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n+| Task heap                                    | [`taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-heap-size)         | infinite                                                                      |\n+| Task off-heap                                | [`taskmanager.memory.task.off-heap.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-off-heap-size) | infinite                                                                      |\n+| Managed memory                               | [`taskmanager.memory.managed.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size)             | 128Mb                                                                         |\n+| Network memory                               | [`taskmanager.memory.network.min`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-network-min) <br /> [`taskmanager.memory.network.max`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-network-max) | 64Mb |\n+{:.table-bordered}\n+<br/>\n+\n+All of the components listed above can be but do not have to be explicitly configured for the local execution.\n+If they are not configured they are set to their default values.

By default,\n+RocksDB is setup to limit native memory allocation to the size of the [managed memory](mem_setup.html#managed-memory).\n+Therefore, it is important to reserve enough *managed memory* for your state use case. If you disable the default RocksDB memory control,\n+task executors can be killed in containerized deployments if RocksDB allocates memory above the limit of the requested container size\n+(the [total process memory](mem_setup.html#configure-total-memory)).\n+See also [state.backend.rocksdb.memory.managed](../config.html#state-backend-rocksdb-memory-managed).\n+\n+## Configure memory for batch jobs\n+\n+Flink's batch operators leverage [managed memory](../memory/mem_setup.html#managed-memory) to run more efficiently.\n+In doing so, some operations can be performed directly on raw data without having to be deserialized into Java objects.\n+This means that [managed memory](../memory/mem_setup.html#managed-memory) configurations have practical effects\n+on the performance of your applications. Flink will attempt to allocate and use as much [managed memory](../memory/mem_setup.html#managed-memory)\n+as configured for batch jobs but not go beyond its limits. This prevents `OutOfMemoryError`'s because Flink knows precisely\n+how much memory it has to leverage. If the [managed memory](../memory/mem_setup.html#managed-memory) is not sufficient,\n+Flink will gracefully spill to disk.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "e34dafad44cbd3eb8cc62b0e0436f096a8f95db6"}, "originalPosition": 86}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMjMzMDU1MDg0OnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "docs/ops/memory/mem_trouble.md", "isResolved": false, "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMi0wOVQwNzo0Mzo1M1rOFnTv5g==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMi0wOVQwNzo0Mzo1M1rOFnTv5g==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3Njc2MjM0Mg==", "bodyText": "This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

Many configuration options\n+were removed or their semantics changed. This guide will help you to understand how to migrate the previous memory configuration to the new one.\n+\n+* toc\n+{:toc}\n+\n+<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n+  <strong>Warning:</strong> It is important to review this guide because the legacy and new memory configuration can\n+  result in different sizes of memory components. If you try to reuse your Flink configuration from the previous versions\n+  before 1.10, it can result in changes to the behavior, performance or even configuration failures of your application.\n+</div>\n+\n+<span class=\"label label-info\">Note</span> The previous memory configuration allows that no memory related options are set at all\n+as they all have default values. The [new memory configuration](mem_setup.html#configure-total-memory) requires\n+that at least one subset of the following options is configured explicitly, otherwise the configuration will fail:\n+* [`taskmanager.memory.flink.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-flink-size)\n+* [`taskmanager.memory.process.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-process-size)\n+* [`taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-heap-size) and [`taskmanager.memory.managed.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size)\n+\n+The [default `flink-conf.yaml`](#default-configuration-in-flink-confyaml) shipped with Flink sets [`taskmanager.memory.process.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-process-size)\n+to make the default memory configuration consistent.\n+\n+This [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mJaMkMPfDJJ-w6nMXALYmTc4XxiV30P5U7DzgwLkSoE) can also help\n+to evaluate and compare the results of the legacy and new memory computations.\n+\n+## Changes in Configuration Options\n+\n+This chapter shortly lists all changes in the memory configuration options before the 1.10 release.\n+It also references other chapters for more details about the migration to the new configuration options.\n+\n+The following options are completely removed.

See also [how to migrate container cut-off](#container-cut-off-memory).\n+\n+## Total Memory (previously Heap Memory)\n+\n+The previous options which were responsible for the total memory used by Flink are `taskmanager.heap.size` or `taskmanager.heap.mb`.\n+Despite their naming, they included not only JVM heap but also other off-heap memory components. The options have been deprecated.\n+\n+The Mesos integration also had a separate option with the same semantics: `mesos.resourcemanager.tasks.mem` which has also been deprecated.\n+\n+If the mentioned legacy options are used without specifying the corresponding new options,\n+they will be directly translated into the following new options:\n+* Total Flink memory ([`taskmanager.memory.flink.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-flink-size)) for standalone deployments\n+* Total process memory ([`taskmanager.memory.process.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-process-size)) for containerized deployments (Yarn or Mesos)\n+\n+It is also recommended to use these new options instead of the legacy ones as they might be completely removed in the following releases.\n+\n+See also [how to configure total memory now](mem_setup.html#configure-total-memory).\n+\n+## JVM Heap Memory\n+\n+JVM heap memory previously consisted of the managed memory (if configured to be on-heap) and the rest\n+which included any other usages of heap memory. This rest was always implicitly derived as the remaining part of the total memory,\n+see also [how to migrate managed memory](#managed-memory).\n+\n+Now, if only *total Flink memory* or *total process memory* is configured, then the JVM heap is also derived as the rest of\n+what is left after subtracting all other components from the total memory, see also [how to configure total memory](mem_setup.html#configure-total-memory).\n+\n+Additionally, you can now have more direct control over the JVM heap assigned to the operator tasks\n+([`taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-heap-size)),\n+see also [Task (Operator) Heap Memory](mem_setup.html#task-operator-heap-memory).\n+The same memory has to be accounted for the heap state backend ([MemoryStateBackend](../state/state_backends.html#the-memorystatebackend)\n+or [FsStateBackend](../state/state_backends.html#the-fsstatebackend) if it is chosen for streaming jobs.\n+\n+A part of the JVM heap is now always reserved for Flink framework\n+([`taskmanager.memory.framework.heap.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-framework-heap-size)).\n+See also [Framework memory](mem_setup.html#framework-memory).\n+\n+## Managed Memory\n+\n+See also [how to configure managed memory now](mem_setup.html#managed-memory).\n+\n+### Explicit size\n+\n+The previous option to configure managed memory size (`taskmanager.memory.size`) was renamed to\n+[`taskmanager.memory.managed.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size) and deprecated.\n+It is recommended to use the new option because the legacy one can be removed in future releases.\n+\n+### Fraction\n+\n+If not set explicitly, the managed memory could be previously specified as a fraction (`taskmanager.memory.fraction`)\n+of the total memory minus network memory and container cut-off (only for [Yarn](../deployment/yarn_setup.html) and\n+[Mesos](../deployment/mesos.html) deployments). This option has been completely removed and will have no effect if still used.\n+Please, use the new option [`taskmanager.memory.managed.fraction`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-fraction) instead.\n+This new option will set the [managed memory](mem_setup.html#managed-memory) to the specified fraction of the\n+[total Flink memory](mem_setup.html#configure-total-memory) if its size is not set explicitly by\n+[`taskmanager.memory.managed.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size).\n+\n+### RocksDB state\n+\n+If the [RocksDBStateBackend](../state/state_backends.html#the-rocksdbstatebackend) is chosen for a streaming job,\n+its native memory consumption should now be accounted for in [managed memory](mem_setup.html#managed-memory).\n+The RocksDB memory allocation is limited by the [managed memory](mem_setup.html#managed-memory) size.\n+This should prevent the killing of containers on [Yarn](../deployment/yarn_setup.html) or [Mesos](../deployment/mesos.html).\n+See also [how to migrate container cut-off](#container-cut-off-memory).\n+\n+### Other changes\n+\n+Additionally, the following changes have been made:\n+* The [managed memory](mem_setup.html#managed-memory) is always off-heap now. The configuration option `taskmanager.memory.off-heap` is removed and will have no effect anymore.\n+* The [managed memory](mem_setup.html#managed-memory) now uses native memory which is not direct memory. It means that the managed memory is no longer accounted for in the JVM direct memory limit.\n+* The [managed memory](mem_setup.html#managed-memory) is always lazily allocated now. The configuration option `taskmanager.memory.preallocate` is removed and will have no effect anymore.\n+\n+## Container Cut-Off Memory\n+\n+For containerized deployments, you could previously specify a cut-off memory. This memory could accommodate for unaccounted memory allocations.\n+Dependencies which were not directly controlled by Flink were the main source of those allocations, e.g. RocksDB, internals of JVM etc.\n+This is no longer available and the related configuration options (`containerized.heap-cutoff-ratio` and `containerized.heap-cutoff-min`)\n+will have no effect on the task manager process anymore. The new memory model introduced more specific memory components,\n+described further, to address these concerns.\n+\n+In streaming jobs which use [RocksDBStateBackend](../state/state_backends.html#the-rocksdbstatebackend), the RocksDB\n+native memory consumption should be accounted for as a part of the [managed memory](mem_setup.html#managed-memory) now.\n+The RocksDB memory allocation is also limited by the configured size of the [managed memory](mem_setup.html#managed-memory).\n+See also [migrating managed memory](#managed-memory) and [how to configure managed memory now](mem_setup.html#managed-memory).\n+\n+The other specific consumption of direct or native off-heap memory can be now addressed by the following new configuration options:", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "e34dafad44cbd3eb8cc62b0e0436f096a8f95db6"}, "originalPosition": 214}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMjMxMzY4NDU5OnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "docs/ops/memory/mem_setup.md", "isResolved": true, "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMi0wM1QxNDoyNzo0NVrOFkzLLw==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMi0wM1QxNDoyNzo0NVrOFkzLLw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3NDEzMTUwMw==", "bodyText": "This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

The *total Flink memory* splits up into [managed memory size](#managed-memory) and JVM heap.\n+\n+If you configure *total process memory* you declare how much memory in total should be assigned to the Flink *JVM process*.\n+For the containerized deployments it corresponds to the size of the requested container, see also\n+[how to configure memory for containers](mem_tuning.html#configure-memory-for-containers)\n+([Kubernetes](../deployment/kubernetes.html), [Yarn](../deployment/yarn_setup.html) or [Mesos](../deployment/mesos.html)).\n+\n+Another way to setup the memory is to set [task heap](#task-operator-heap-memory) and [managed memory](#managed-memory)\n+([taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-heap-size) and [taskmanager.memory.managed.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size)).\n+This more fine-grained approach is described further in a [separate section](#configure-heap-and-managed-memory).\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> One of the three mentioned ways has to be used to configure Flink\u2019s memory (except for local execution), or the Flink startup will fail.\n+This means that one of the following option subsets, which do not have default values, have to be configured explicitly in *flink-conf.yaml*:\n+* [taskmanager.memory.flink.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-flink-size-1)\n+* [taskmanager.memory.process.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-process-size-1)\n+* [taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-heap-size) and [taskmanager.memory.managed.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size)\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> Explicitly configuring both *total process memory* and *total Flink memory* is not recommended.\n+It may lead to deployment failures due to potential memory configuration conflicts. Additional configuration\n+of other memory components also requires caution as it can produce further configuration conflicts.\n+The conflict can occur e.g. if the sum of sub-components does not add up to the total configured memory or size of some\n+component is outside of its min/max range, see also [the detailed memory model](#detailed-memory-model).\n+\n+## Configure Heap and Managed Memory\n+\n+As mentioned before in [total memory description](#configure-total-memory), another way to setup memory in Flink is\n+to specify explicitly both [task heap](#task-operator-heap-memory) and [managed memory](#managed-memory).\n+It gives more control over the available JVM heap to Flink\u2019s tasks and its [managed memory](#managed-memory).\n+\n+The rest of the memory components will be adjusted automatically, based on default values or additionally configured options.\n+[Here](#detailed-memory-model) are more details about the other memory components.\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> If you have explicitly configured task heap and managed memory, it is recommended to set neither\n+*total process memory* nor *total Flink memory*.

To provide the most production value to our users,\n+Flink allows both high level and fine-grained tuning of memory allocation within clusters.\n+\n+* toc\n+{:toc}\n+\n+The further described memory configuration is applicable starting with the release version *1.10*. If you upgrade Flink\n+from earlier versions, check the [migration guide](mem_migration.html) because many changes were introduced with the 1.10 release.\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> This memory setup guide is relevant <strong>only for task executors</strong>!\n+Check [job manager related configuration options](../config.html#jobmanager) for the memory setup of job manager.\n+\n+## Configure Total Memory\n+\n+The *total process memory* of Flink JVM processes consists of memory consumed by Flink application (*total Flink memory*)\n+and by the JVM to run the process. The *total Flink memory* consumption includes usage of JVM heap,\n+*managed memory* (managed by Flink) and other direct (or native) memory.\n+\n+<center>\n+  <img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/fig/simple_mem_model.svg\" width=\"300px\" alt=\"Simple memory model\" usemap=\"#simple-mem-model\">\n+</center>\n+<br />\n+\n+If you run FIink locally (e.g. from your IDE) without creating a cluster, then only a subset of the memory configuration\n+options are relevant, see also [local execution](#local-execution) for more details.\n+\n+Otherwise, the simplest way to setup memory in Flink is to configure either of the two following options:\n+* Total Flink memory ([taskmanager.memory.flink.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-flink-size-1))\n+* Total process memory ([taskmanager.memory.process.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-process-size-1))\n+\n+The rest of the memory components will be adjusted automatically, based on default values or additionally configured options.\n+[Here](#detailed-memory-model) are more details about the other memory components.\n+\n+Configuring *total Flink memory* is better suited for standalone deployments where you want to declare how much memory\n+is given to Flink itself. The *total Flink memory* splits up into [managed memory size](#managed-memory) and JVM heap.\n+\n+If you configure *total process memory* you declare how much memory in total should be assigned to the Flink *JVM process*.\n+For the containerized deployments it corresponds to the size of the requested container, see also\n+[how to configure memory for containers](mem_tuning.html#configure-memory-for-containers)\n+([Kubernetes](../deployment/kubernetes.html), [Yarn](../deployment/yarn_setup.html) or [Mesos](../deployment/mesos.html)).\n+\n+Another way to setup the memory is to set [task heap](#task-operator-heap-memory) and [managed memory](#managed-memory)\n+([taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-heap-size) and [taskmanager.memory.managed.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size)).\n+This more fine-grained approach is described in more detail [here](#configure-heap-and-managed-memory).\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> One of the three mentioned ways has to be used to configure Flink\u2019s memory (except for local execution), or the Flink startup will fail.\n+This means that one of the following option subsets, which do not have default values, have to be configured explicitly in *flink-conf.yaml*:\n+* [taskmanager.memory.flink.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-flink-size-1)\n+* [taskmanager.memory.process.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-process-size-1)\n+* [taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-heap-size) and [taskmanager.memory.managed.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size)\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> Explicitly configuring both *total process memory* and *total Flink memory* is not recommended.\n+It may lead to deployment failures due to potential memory configuration conflicts. Additional configuration\n+of other memory components also requires caution as it can produce further configuration conflicts.\n+The conflict can occur e.g. if the sum of sub-components does not add up to the total configured memory or size of some\n+component is outside of its min/max range, see also [the detailed memory model](#detailed-memory-model).\n+\n+## Configure Heap and Managed Memory\n+\n+As mentioned before in [total memory description](#configure-total-memory), another way to setup memory in Flink is\n+to specify explicitly both [task heap](#task-operator-heap-memory) and [managed memory](#managed-memory).\n+It gives more control over the available JVM heap to Flink\u2019s tasks and its [managed memory](#managed-memory).\n+\n+The rest of the memory components will be adjusted automatically, based on default values or additionally configured options.\n+[Here](#detailed-memory-model) are more details about the other memory components.\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> If you have configured the task heap and managed memory explicitly, it is recommended to set neither\n+*total process memory* nor *total Flink memory*. Otherwise, it may easily lead to memory configuration conflicts.\n+\n+### Task (Operator) Heap Memory\n+\n+If you want to guarantee that a certain amount of JVM heap is available for your user code, you can set the *task heap memory*\n+explicitly ([taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-heap-size)).\n+It will be added to the JVM heap size and will be dedicated to Flink\u2019s operators running the user code.\n+\n+### Managed Memory\n+\n+*Managed memory* is managed by Flink and is allocated as native memory (off-heap). The following workloads use *managed memory*:\n+* Streaming jobs can use it for [RocksDB state backend](../state/state_backends.html#the-rocksdbstatebackend).\n+* [Batch jobs](../../dev/batch) can use it for sorting, hash tables, caching of intermediate results.\n+\n+The size of *managed memory* can be\n+* either configured explicitly via [taskmanager.memory.managed.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size)\n+* or computed as a fraction of *total Flink memory* via [taskmanager.memory.managed.fraction](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-fraction)\n+\n+*size* will override *fraction*, if both are set.\n+If neither *size* nor *fraction* is explicitly configured, the [default fraction](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-fraction) will be used.\n+\n+See also [how to configure memory for state backends](mem_tuning.html#configure-memory-for-state-backends) and [batch jobs](mem_tuning.html#configure-memory-for-batch-jobs).\n+\n+## Configure Off-Heap Memory (direct or native)\n+\n+The off-heap memory which is allocated by user code should be accounted for in *task off-heap memory*\n+([taskmanager.memory.task.off-heap.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-off-heap-size)).\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> You can also increase the [framework off-heap memory](#framework-memory). This option is advanced\n+and only recommended to be changed if you are sure that the Flink framework needs more memory.\n+\n+Flink includes the *framework off-heap memory* and *task off-heap memory* into the *direct memory* limit of the JVM,\n+see also [JVM parameters](#jvm-parameters).\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> Although, native non-direct memory usage can be accounted for as a part of the\n+*framework off-heap memory* or *task off-heap memory*, it means that the JVM's *direct memory* limit will be higher.\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> The *network memory* is also part of JVM *direct memory* but it is managed by Flink and guaranteed\n+to never exceed its configured size. Therefore, resizing the *network memory* will not help in this situation.\n+\n+See also [detailed Memory Model](#detailed-memory-model).\n+\n+## Detailed Memory Model\n+\n+This section gives a

simply set by the respective option.\n+Other components can be tuned using multiple options.\n+\n+### Framework Memory\n+\n+The *framework heap memory* and *framework off-heap memory* options are not supposed to be changed without a good reason.\n+Adjust them only if you are sure that Flink needs more memory for some internal data structures or operations.\n+It can be related to a particular deployment environment or job structure, like high parallelism.\n+In addition, Flink dependencies, such as Hadoop may consume more direct or native memory in certain setups.\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> Neither heap nor off-heap versions of framework and task memory are currently isolated within Flink.\n+The separation of framework and task memory can be used in future releases for further optimizations.\n+\n+### Capped Fractionated Components\n+\n+This section describes the configuration details of the following options which can be a fraction of a certain\n+[total memory](#configure-total-memory):\n+\n+* *Network memory* can be a fraction of the *total Flink memory*\n+* *JVM overhead* can be a fraction of the *total process memory*\n+\n+See also [detailed memory model](#detailed-memory-model).\n+\n+The size of those components always has to be between its maximum and minimum value, otherwise Flink startup will fail.\n+The maximum and minimum values have defaults or can be explicitly set by corresponding configuration options.\n+Notice if you configure the same maximum and minimum value it effectively means that its size is fixed to that value.\n+For example, if the following options are:\n+- total Flink memory = 1000mb,\n+- network min = 64mb,\n+- network max = 128mb,\n+- network fraction = 0.1\n+\n+then the network memory

To provide the most production value to our users,\n+Flink allows both high level and fine-grained tuning of memory allocation within clusters.\n+\n+* toc\n+{:toc}\n+\n+The further described memory configuration is applicable starting with the release version *1.10*. If you upgrade Flink\n+from earlier versions, check the [migration guide](mem_migration.html) because many changes were introduced with the 1.10 release.\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> This memory setup guide is relevant <strong>only for task executors</strong>!\n+Check [job manager related configuration options](../config.html#jobmanager) for the memory setup of job manager.\n+\n+## Configure Total Memory\n+\n+The *total process memory* of Flink JVM processes consists of memory consumed by Flink application (*total Flink memory*)\n+and by the JVM to run the process. The *total Flink memory* consumption includes usage of JVM heap,\n+*managed memory* (managed by Flink) and other direct (or native) memory.\n+\n+<center>\n+  <img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/fig/simple_mem_model.svg\" width=\"300px\" alt=\"Simple memory model\" usemap=\"#simple-mem-model\">\n+</center>\n+<br />\n+\n+If you run FIink locally (e.g. from your IDE) without creating a cluster, then only a subset of the memory configuration\n+options are relevant, see also [local execution](#local-execution) for more details.\n+\n+Otherwise, the simplest way to setup memory in Flink is to configure either of the two following options:\n+* Total Flink memory ([taskmanager.memory.flink.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-flink-size-1))\n+* Total process memory ([taskmanager.memory.process.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-process-size-1))\n+\n+The rest of the memory components will be adjusted automatically, based on default values or additionally configured options.\n+[Here](#detailed-memory-model) are more details about the other memory components.\n+\n+Configuring *total Flink memory* is better suited for standalone deployments where you want to declare how much memory\n+is given to Flink itself. The *total Flink memory* splits up into [managed memory size](#managed-memory) and JVM heap.\n+\n+If you configure *total process memory* you declare how much memory in total should be assigned to the Flink *JVM process*.\n+For the containerized deployments it corresponds to the size of the requested container, see also\n+[how to configure memory for containers](mem_tuning.html#configure-memory-for-containers)\n+([Kubernetes](../deployment/kubernetes.html), [Yarn](../deployment/yarn_setup.html) or [Mesos](../deployment/mesos.html)).\n+\n+Another way to setup the memory is to set [task heap](#task-operator-heap-memory) and [managed memory](#managed-memory)\n+([taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-heap-size) and [taskmanager.memory.managed.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size)).\n+This more fine-grained approach is described in more detail [here](#configure-heap-and-managed-memory).\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> One of the three mentioned ways has to be used to configure Flink\u2019s memory (except for local execution), or the Flink startup will fail.\n+This means that one of the following option subsets, which do not have default values, have to be configured explicitly in *flink-conf.yaml*:\n+* [taskmanager.memory.flink.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-flink-size-1)\n+* [taskmanager.memory.process.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-process-size-1)\n+* [taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-heap-size) and [taskmanager.memory.managed.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size)\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> Explicitly configuring both *total process memory* and *total Flink memory* is not recommended.\n+It may lead to deployment failures due to potential memory configuration conflicts. Additional configuration\n+of other memory components also requires caution as it can produce further configuration conflicts.\n+The conflict can occur e.g. if the sum of sub-components does not add up to the total configured memory or size of some\n+component is outside of its min/max range, see also [the detailed memory model](#detailed-memory-model).\n+\n+## Configure Heap and Managed Memory\n+\n+As mentioned before in [total memory description](#configure-total-memory), another way to setup memory in Flink is\n+to specify explicitly both [task heap](#task-operator-heap-memory) and [managed memory](#managed-memory).\n+It gives more control over the available JVM heap to Flink\u2019s tasks and its [managed memory](#managed-memory).\n+\n+The rest of the memory components will be adjusted automatically, based on default values or additionally configured options.\n+[Here](#detailed-memory-model) are more details about the other memory components.\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> If you have configured the task heap and managed memory explicitly, it is recommended to set neither\n+*total process memory* nor *total Flink memory*. Otherwise, it may easily lead to memory configuration conflicts.\n+\n+### Task (Operator) Heap Memory\n+\n+If you want to guarantee that a certain amount of JVM heap is available for your user code, you can set the *task heap memory*\n+explicitly ([taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-heap-size)).\n+It will be added to the JVM heap size and will be dedicated to Flink\u2019s operators running the user code.\n+\n+### Managed Memory\n+\n+*Managed memory* is managed by Flink and is allocated as native memory (off-heap). The following workloads use *managed memory*:\n+* Streaming jobs can use it for [RocksDB state backend](../state/state_backends.html#the-rocksdbstatebackend).\n+* [Batch jobs](../../dev/batch) can use it for sorting, hash tables, caching of intermediate results.\n+\n+The size of *managed memory* can be\n+* either configured explicitly via [taskmanager.memory.managed.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size)\n+* or computed as a fraction of *total Flink memory* via [taskmanager.memory.managed.fraction](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-fraction)\n+\n+*size* will override *fraction*, if both are set.\n+If neither *size* nor *fraction* is explicitly configured, the [default fraction](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-fraction) will be used.\n+\n+See also [how to configure memory for state backends](mem_tuning.html#configure-memory-for-state-backends) and [batch jobs](mem_tuning.html#configure-memory-for-batch-jobs).\n+\n+## Configure Off-Heap Memory (direct or native)\n+\n+The off-heap memory which is allocated by user code should be accounted for in *task off-heap memory*\n+([taskmanager.memory.task.off-heap.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-off-heap-size)).\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> You can also increase the [framework off-heap memory](#framework-memory). This option is advanced\n+and only recommended to be changed if you are sure that the Flink framework needs more memory.\n+\n+Flink includes the *framework off-heap memory* and *task off-heap memory* into the *direct memory* limit of the JVM,\n+see also [JVM parameters](#jvm-parameters).\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> Although, native non-direct memory usage can be accounted for as a part of the\n+*framework off-heap memory* or *task off-heap memory*, it means that the JVM's *direct memory* limit will be higher.\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> The *network memory* is also part of JVM *direct memory* but it is managed by Flink and guaranteed\n+to never exceed its configured size. Therefore, resizing the *network memory* will not help in this situation.\n+\n+See also [detailed Memory Model](#detailed-memory-model).\n+\n+## Detailed Memory Model\n+\n+This section gives a detailed description of all components in Flink\u2019s memory model.\n+\n+<br />\n+<center>\n+  <img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/fig/detailed-mem-model.svg\" width=\"300px\" alt=\"Simple memory model\"

simply set by the respective option.\n+Other components can be tuned using multiple options.\n+\n+### Framework Memory\n+\n+The *framework heap memory* and *framework off-heap memory* options are not supposed to be changed without a good reason.\n+Adjust them only if you are sure that Flink needs more memory for some internal data structures or operations.\n+It can be related to a particular deployment environment or job structure, like high parallelism.\n+In addition, Flink dependencies, such as Hadoop may consume more direct or native memory in certain setups.\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> Neither heap nor off-heap versions of framework and task memory are currently isolated within Flink.\n+The separation of framework and task memory can be used in future releases for further optimizations.\n+\n+### Capped Fractionated Components\n+\n+This section describes the configuration details of the following options which can be a fraction of a certain\n+[total memory](#configure-total-memory):\n+\n+* *Network memory* can be a fraction of the *total Flink memory*\n+* *JVM overhead* can be a fraction of the *total process memory*\n+\n+See also [detailed memory model](#detailed-memory-model).\n+\n+The size of those components always has to be between its maximum and minimum value, otherwise Flink startup will fail.\n+The maximum and minimum values have defaults or can be explicitly set by corresponding configuration options.\n+Notice if you configure the same maximum and minimum value it effectively means that its size is fixed to that value.\n+For example, if the following options are:\n+- total Flink memory = 1000mb,\n+- network min = 64mb,\n+- network max = 128mb,\n+- network fraction = 0.1\n+\n+then the network memory will be 1000mb x 0.1 = 100Mb which is within the range 64-128Mb.\n+\n+If the component memory is not explicitly configured, then Flink will use the fraction to calculate the memory size\n+based on the total memory. The calculated value is capped by its corresponding min/max options.\n+For example, if the following options are:\n+- total Flink memory = 1000mb,\n+- network min = 128mb,\n+- network max = 256mb,\n+- network fraction = 0.1\n+\n+then the network memory will be 128Mb because the fraction is 100mb and it is less than the minimum.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "4ff824338b9bee9a678932f6c5bdad6e62582379"}, "originalPosition": 204}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMjMxNTc4ODU5OnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "docs/ops/memory/mem_setup.md", "isResolved": false, "comments": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMi0wNFQwMzo1OToxNVrOFlHdfQ==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMi0wNFQwOTo0Nzo0OFrOFlN0TA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3NDQ2Mzg2OQ==", "bodyText": "This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

To provide the most production value to our users,\n+Flink allows both high level and fine-grained tuning of memory allocation within clusters.\n+\n+* toc\n+{:toc}\n+\n+The further described memory configuration is applicable starting with the release version *1.10*. If you upgrade Flink\n+from earlier versions, check the [migration guide](mem_migration.html) because many changes were introduced with the 1.10 release.\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> This memory setup guide is relevant <strong>only for task executors</strong>!\n+Check [job manager related configuration options](../config.html#jobmanager) for the memory setup of job manager.\n+\n+## Configure Total Memory\n+\n+The *total process memory* of Flink JVM processes consists of memory consumed by Flink application (*total Flink memory*)\n+and by the JVM to run the process. The *total Flink memory* consumption includes usage of JVM heap,\n+*managed memory* (managed by Flink) and other direct (or native) memory.\n+\n+<center>\n+  <img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/fig/simple_mem_model.svg\" width=\"300px\" alt=\"Simple memory model\" usemap=\"#simple-mem-model\">\n+</center>\n+<br />\n+\n+If you run FIink locally (e.g. from your IDE) without creating a cluster, then only a subset of the memory configuration\n+options are relevant, see also [local execution](#local-execution) for more details.\n+\n+Otherwise, the simplest way to setup memory in Flink is to configure either of the two following options:\n+* Total Flink memory ([taskmanager.memory.flink.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-flink-size-1))\n+* Total process memory ([taskmanager.memory.process.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-process-size-1))\n+\n+The rest of the memory components will be adjusted automatically, based on default values or additionally configured options.\n+[Here](#detailed-memory-model) are more details about the other memory components.\n+\n+Configuring *total Flink memory* is better suited for standalone deployments where you want to declare how much memory\n+is given to Flink itself. The *total Flink memory* splits up into [managed memory size](#managed-memory) and JVM heap.\n+\n+If you configure *total process memory* you declare how much memory in total should be assigned to the Flink *JVM process*.\n+For the containerized deployments it corresponds to the size of the requested container, see also\n+[how to configure memory for containers](mem_tuning.html#configure-memory-for-containers)\n+([Kubernetes](../deployment/kubernetes.html), [Yarn](../deployment/yarn_setup.html) or [Mesos](../deployment/mesos.html)).\n+\n+Another way to setup the memory is to set [task heap](#task-operator-heap-memory) and [managed memory](#managed-memory)\n+([taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-heap-size) and [taskmanager.memory.managed.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size)).\n+This more fine-grained approach is described in more detail [here](#configure-heap-and-managed-memory).\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> One of the three mentioned ways has to be used to configure Flink\u2019s memory (except for local execution), or the Flink startup will fail.\n+This means that one of the following option subsets, which do not have default values, have to be configured explicitly in *flink-conf.yaml*:\n+* [taskmanager.memory.flink.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-flink-size-1)\n+* [taskmanager.memory.process.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-process-size-1)\n+* [taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-heap-size) and [taskmanager.memory.managed.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size)\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> Explicitly configuring both *total process memory* and *total Flink memory* is not recommended.\n+It may lead to deployment failures due to potential memory configuration conflicts. Additional configuration\n+of other memory components also requires caution as it can produce further configuration conflicts.\n+The conflict can occur e.g. if the sum of sub-components does not add up to the total configured memory or size of some\n+component is outside of its min/max range, see also [the detailed memory model](#detailed-memory-model).\n+\n+## Configure Heap and Managed Memory\n+\n+As mentioned before in [total memory description](#configure-total-memory), another way to setup memory in Flink is\n+to specify explicitly both [task heap](#task-operator-heap-memory) and [managed memory](#managed-memory).\n+It gives more control over the available JVM heap to Flink\u2019s tasks and its [managed memory](#managed-memory).\n+\n+The rest of the memory components will be adjusted automatically, based on default values or additionally configured options.\n+[Here](#detailed-memory-model) are more details about the other memory components.\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> If you have configured the task heap and managed memory explicitly, it is recommended to set neither\n+*total process memory* nor *total Flink memory*. Otherwise, it may easily lead to memory configuration conflicts.\n+\n+### Task (Operator) Heap Memory\n+\n+If you want to guarantee that a certain amount of JVM heap is available for your user code, you can set the *task heap memory*\n+explicitly ([taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-heap-size)).\n+It will be added to the JVM heap size and will be dedicated to Flink\u2019s operators running the user code.\n+\n+### Managed Memory\n+\n+*Managed memory* is managed by Flink and is allocated as native memory (off-heap). The following workloads use *managed memory*:\n+* Streaming jobs can use it for [RocksDB state backend](../state/state_backends.html#the-rocksdbstatebackend).\n+* [Batch jobs](../../dev/batch) can use it for sorting, hash tables, caching of intermediate results.\n+\n+The size of *managed memory* can be\n+* either configured explicitly via [taskmanager.memory.managed.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size)\n+* or computed as a fraction of *total Flink memory* via [taskmanager.memory.managed.fraction](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-fraction)\n+\n+*size* will override *fraction*, if both are set.\n+If neither *size* nor *fraction* is explicitly configured, the [default fraction](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-fraction) will be used.\n+\n+See also [how to configure memory for state backends](mem_tuning.html#configure-memory-for-state-backends) and [batch jobs](mem_tuning.html#configure-memory-for-batch-jobs).\n+\n+## Configure Off-Heap Memory (direct or native)\n+\n+The off-heap memory which is allocated by user code should be accounted for in *task off-heap memory*\n+([taskmanager.memory.task.off-heap.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-off-heap-size)).\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> You can also increase the [framework off-heap memory](#framework-memory). This option is advanced\n+and only recommended to be changed if you are sure that the Flink framework needs more memory.\n+\n+Flink includes the *framework off-heap memory* and *task off-heap memory* into the *direct memory* limit of the JVM,\n+see also [JVM parameters](#jvm-parameters).\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> Although, native non-direct memory usage can be accounted for as a part of the\n+*framework off-heap memory* or *task off-heap memory*, it means that the JVM's *direct memory* limit will be higher.\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> The *network memory* is also part of JVM *direct memory* but it is managed by Flink and guaranteed\n+to never exceed its configured size. Therefore, resizing the *network memory* will not help in this situation.\n+\n+See also [detailed Memory Model](#detailed-memory-model).\n+\n+## Detailed Memory Model\n+\n+This section gives a detailed description of all components in Flink\u2019s memory model.\n+\n+<br />\n+<center>\n+  <img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/fig/detailed-mem-model.svg\" width=\"300px\" alt=\"Simple memory model\"

to that value.\n+For example, if the following options are:\n+- total Flink memory = 1000mb,\n+- network min = 64mb,\n+- network max = 128mb,\n+- network fraction = 0.1\n+\n+then the network memory will be 1000mb x 0.1 = 100Mb which is within the range 64-128Mb.\n+\n+If the component memory is not explicitly configured, then Flink will use the fraction to calculate the memory size\n+based on the total memory. The calculated value is capped by its corresponding min/max options.\n+For example, if the following options are:\n+- total Flink memory = 1000mb,\n+- network min = 128mb,\n+- network max = 256mb,\n+- network fraction = 0.1\n+\n+then the network memory will be 128Mb because the fraction is 100mb and it is less than the minimum.\n+\n+It can also happen that the fraction is ignored if the size of the total memory and its other components is defined.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "4ff824338b9bee9a678932f6c5bdad6e62582379"}, "originalPosition": 206}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3NDU2ODAxMg==", "bodyText": "is was related to the size but we can change it to the sizes then if it is more clear", "url": "https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/10999#discussion_r374568012", "createdAt": "2020-02-04T09:47:48Z", "author": {"login": "azagrebin"}, "path": "docs/ops/memory/mem_setup.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,251 @@\n+---\n+title: \"Setup Task Executor Memory\"\n+nav-parent_id: ops_mem\n+nav-pos: 1\n+---\n+<!--\n+Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\n+or more contributor license agreements.

To provide the most production value to our users,\n+Flink allows both high level and fine-grained tuning of memory allocation within clusters.\n+\n+* toc\n+{:toc}\n+\n+The further described memory configuration is applicable starting with the release version *1.10*. If you upgrade Flink\n+from earlier versions, check the [migration guide](mem_migration.html) because many changes were introduced with the 1.10 release.\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> This memory setup guide is relevant <strong>only for task executors</strong>!\n+Check [job manager related configuration options](../config.html#jobmanager) for the memory setup of job manager.\n+\n+## Configure Total Memory\n+\n+The *total process memory* of Flink JVM processes consists of memory consumed by Flink application (*total Flink memory*)\n+and by the JVM to run the process. The *total Flink memory* consumption includes usage of JVM heap,\n+*managed memory* (managed by Flink) and other direct (or native) memory.\n+\n+<center>\n+  <img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/fig/simple_mem_model.svg\" width=\"300px\" alt=\"Simple memory model\" usemap=\"#simple-mem-model\">\n+</center>\n+<br />\n+\n+If you run FIink locally (e.g. from your IDE) without creating a cluster, then only a subset of the memory configuration\n+options are relevant, see also [local execution](#local-execution) for more details.\n+\n+Otherwise, the simplest way to setup memory in Flink is to configure either of the two following options:\n+* Total Flink memory ([taskmanager.memory.flink.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-flink-size-1))\n+* Total process memory ([taskmanager.memory.process.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-process-size-1))\n+\n+The rest of the memory components will be adjusted automatically, based on default values or additionally configured options.\n+[Here](#detailed-memory-model) are more details about the other memory components.\n+\n+Configuring *total Flink memory* is better suited for standalone deployments where you want to declare how much memory\n+is given to Flink itself. The *total Flink memory* splits up into [managed memory size](#managed-memory) and JVM heap.\n+\n+If you configure *total process memory* you declare how much memory in total should be assigned to the Flink *JVM process*.\n+For the containerized deployments it corresponds to the size of the requested container, see also\n+[how to configure memory for containers](mem_tuning.html#configure-memory-for-containers)\n+([Kubernetes](../deployment/kubernetes.html), [Yarn](../deployment/yarn_setup.html) or [Mesos](../deployment/mesos.html)).\n+\n+Another way to setup the memory is to set [task heap](#task-operator-heap-memory) and [managed memory](#managed-memory)\n+([taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-heap-size) and [taskmanager.memory.managed.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size)).\n+This more fine-grained approach is described in more detail [here](#configure-heap-and-managed-memory).\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> One of the three mentioned ways has to be used to configure Flink\u2019s memory (except for local execution), or the Flink startup will fail.\n+This means that one of the following option subsets, which do not have default values, have to be configured explicitly in *flink-conf.yaml*:\n+* [taskmanager.memory.flink.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-flink-size-1)\n+* [taskmanager.memory.process.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-process-size-1)\n+* [taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-heap-size) and [taskmanager.memory.managed.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size)\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> Explicitly configuring both *total process memory* and *total Flink memory* is not recommended.\n+It may lead to deployment failures due to potential memory configuration conflicts. Additional configuration\n+of other memory components also requires caution as it can produce further configuration conflicts.\n+The conflict can occur e.g. if the sum of sub-components does not add up to the total configured memory or size of some\n+component is outside of its min/max range, see also [the detailed memory model](#detailed-memory-model).\n+\n+## Configure Heap and Managed Memory\n+\n+As mentioned before in [total memory description](#configure-total-memory), another way to setup memory in Flink is\n+to specify explicitly both [task heap](#task-operator-heap-memory) and [managed memory](#managed-memory).\n+It gives more control over the available JVM heap to Flink\u2019s tasks and its [managed memory](#managed-memory).\n+\n+The rest of the memory components will be adjusted automatically, based on default values or additionally configured options.\n+[Here](#detailed-memory-model) are more details about the other memory components.\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> If you have configured the task heap and managed memory explicitly, it is recommended to set neither\n+*total process memory* nor *total Flink memory*. Otherwise, it may easily lead to memory configuration conflicts.\n+\n+### Task (Operator) Heap Memory\n+\n+If you want to guarantee that a certain amount of JVM heap is available for your user code, you can set the *task heap memory*\n+explicitly ([taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-heap-size)).\n+It will be added to the JVM heap size and will be dedicated to Flink\u2019s operators running the user code.\n+\n+### Managed Memory\n+\n+*Managed memory* is managed by Flink and is allocated as native memory (off-heap). The following workloads use *managed memory*:\n+* Streaming jobs can use it for [RocksDB state backend](../state/state_backends.html#the-rocksdbstatebackend).\n+* [Batch jobs](../../dev/batch) can use it for sorting, hash tables, caching of intermediate results.\n+\n+The size of *managed memory* can be\n+* either configured explicitly via [taskmanager.memory.managed.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size)\n+* or computed as a fraction of *total Flink memory* via [taskmanager.memory.managed.fraction](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-fraction)\n+\n+*size* will override *fraction*, if both are set.\n+If neither *size* nor *fraction* is explicitly configured, the [default fraction](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-fraction) will be used.\n+\n+See also [how to configure memory for state backends](mem_tuning.html#configure-memory-for-state-backends) and [batch jobs](mem_tuning.html#configure-memory-for-batch-jobs).\n+\n+## Configure Off-Heap Memory (direct or native)\n+\n+The off-heap memory which is allocated by user code should be accounted for in *task off-heap memory*\n+([taskmanager.memory.task.off-heap.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-off-heap-size)).\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> You can also increase the [framework off-heap memory](#framework-memory). This option is advanced\n+and only recommended to be changed if you are sure that the Flink framework needs more memory.\n+\n+Flink includes the *framework off-heap memory* and *task off-heap memory* into the *direct memory* limit of the JVM,\n+see also [JVM parameters](#jvm-parameters).\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> Although, native non-direct memory usage can be accounted for as a part of the\n+*framework off-heap memory* or *task off-heap memory*, it means that the JVM's *direct memory* limit will be higher.\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> The *network memory* is also part of JVM *direct memory* but it is managed by Flink and guaranteed\n+to never exceed its configured size. Therefore, resizing the *network memory* will not help in this situation.\n+\n+See also [detailed Memory Model](#detailed-memory-model).\n+\n+## Detailed Memory Model\n+\n+This section gives a detailed description of all components in Flink\u2019s memory model.\n+\n+<br />\n+<center>\n+  <img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/fig/detailed-mem-model.svg\" width=\"300px\" alt=\"Simple memory model\" usemap=\"#simple-mem-model\">\n+</center>\n+<br />\n+\\* notice, that the *native non-direct* usage of memory in user code can be also accounted for as a part of the *task off-heap memory*,\n+see also

To provide the most production value to our users,\n+Flink allows both high level and fine-grained tuning of memory allocation within clusters.\n+\n+* toc\n+{:toc}\n+\n+The further described memory configuration is applicable starting with the release version *1.10*. If you upgrade Flink\n+from earlier versions, check the [migration guide](mem_migration.html) because many changes were introduced with the 1.10 release.\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> This memory setup guide is relevant <strong>only for task executors</strong>!\n+Check [job manager related configuration options](../config.html#jobmanager) for the memory setup of job manager.\n+\n+## Configure Total Memory\n+\n+The *total process memory* of Flink JVM processes consists of memory consumed by Flink application (*total Flink memory*)\n+and by the JVM to run the process. The *total Flink memory* consumption includes usage of JVM heap,\n+*managed memory* (managed by Flink) and other direct (or native) memory.\n+\n+<center>\n+  <img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/fig/simple_mem_model.svg\" width=\"300px\" alt=\"Simple memory model\" usemap=\"#simple-mem-model\">\n+</center>\n+<br />\n+\n+If you run FIink locally (e.g. from your IDE) without creating a cluster, then only a subset of the memory configuration\n+options are relevant, see also [local execution](#local-execution) for more details.\n+\n+Otherwise, the simplest way to setup memory in Flink is to configure either of the two following options:\n+* Total Flink memory ([taskmanager.memory.flink.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-flink-size-1))\n+* Total process memory ([taskmanager.memory.process.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-process-size-1))\n+\n+The rest of the memory components will be adjusted automatically, based on default values or additionally configured options.\n+[Here](#detailed-memory-model) are more details about the other memory components.\n+\n+Configuring *total Flink memory* is better suited for standalone deployments where you want to declare how much memory\n+is given to Flink itself. The *total Flink memory* splits up into [managed memory size](#managed-memory) and JVM heap.\n+\n+If you configure *total process memory* you declare how much memory in total should be assigned to the Flink *JVM process*.\n+For the containerized deployments it corresponds to the size of the requested container, see also\n+[how to configure memory for containers](mem_tuning.html#configure-memory-for-containers)\n+([Kubernetes](../deployment/kubernetes.html), [Yarn](../deployment/yarn_setup.html) or [Mesos](../deployment/mesos.html)).\n+\n+Another way to setup the memory is to set [task heap](#task-operator-heap-memory) and [managed memory](#managed-memory)\n+([taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-heap-size) and [taskmanager.memory.managed.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size)).\n+This more fine-grained approach is described in more detail [here](#configure-heap-and-managed-memory).\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> One of the three mentioned ways has to be used to configure Flink\u2019s memory (except for local execution), or the Flink startup will fail.\n+This means that one of the following option subsets, which do not have default values, have to be configured explicitly in *flink-conf.yaml*:\n+* [taskmanager.memory.flink.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-flink-size-1)\n+* [taskmanager.memory.process.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-process-size-1)\n+* [taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-heap-size) and [taskmanager.memory.managed.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size)\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> Explicitly configuring both *total process memory* and *total Flink memory* is not recommended.\n+It may lead to deployment failures due to potential memory configuration conflicts. Additional configuration\n+of other memory components also requires caution as it can produce further configuration conflicts.\n+The conflict can occur e.g. if the sum of sub-components does not add up to the total configured memory or size of some\n+component is outside of its min/max range, see also [the detailed memory model](#detailed-memory-model).\n+\n+## Configure Heap and Managed Memory\n+\n+As mentioned before in [total memory description](#configure-total-memory), another way to setup memory in Flink is\n+to specify explicitly both [task heap](#task-operator-heap-memory) and [managed memory](#managed-memory).\n+It gives more control over the available JVM heap to Flink\u2019s tasks and its [managed memory](#managed-memory).\n+\n+The rest of the memory components will be adjusted automatically, based on default values or additionally configured options.\n+[Here](#detailed-memory-model) are more details about the other memory components.\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> If you have configured the task heap and managed memory explicitly, it is recommended to set neither\n+*total process memory* nor *total Flink memory*. Otherwise, it may easily lead to memory configuration conflicts.\n+\n+### Task (Operator) Heap Memory\n+\n+If you want to guarantee that a certain amount of JVM heap is available for your user code, you can set the *task heap memory*\n+explicitly ([taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-heap-size)).\n+It will be added to the JVM heap size and will be dedicated to Flink\u2019s operators running the user code.\n+\n+### Managed Memory\n+\n+*Managed memory* is managed by Flink and is allocated as native memory (off-heap). The following workloads use *managed memory*:\n+* Streaming jobs can use it for [RocksDB state backend](../state/state_backends.html#the-rocksdbstatebackend).\n+* [Batch jobs](../../dev/batch) can use it for sorting, hash tables, caching of intermediate results.\n+\n+The size of *managed memory* can be\n+* either configured explicitly via [taskmanager.memory.managed.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size)\n+* or computed as a fraction of *total Flink memory* via [taskmanager.memory.managed.fraction](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-fraction)\n+\n+*size* will override *fraction*, if both are set.\n+If neither *size* nor *fraction* is explicitly configured, the [default fraction](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-fraction) will be used.\n+\n+See also [how to configure memory for state backends](mem_tuning.html#configure-memory-for-state-backends) and [batch jobs](mem_tuning.html#configure-memory-for-batch-jobs).\n+\n+## Configure Off-Heap Memory (direct or native)\n+\n+The off-heap memory which is allocated by user code should be accounted for in *task off-heap memory*\n+([taskmanager.memory.task.off-heap.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-off-heap-size)).\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> You can also increase the [framework off-heap memory](#framework-memory). This option is advanced\n+and only recommended to be changed if you are sure that the Flink framework needs more memory.\n+\n+Flink includes the *framework off-heap memory* and *task off-heap memory* into the *direct memory* limit of the JVM,\n+see also [JVM parameters](#jvm-parameters).\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> Although, native non-direct memory usage can be accounted for as a part of the\n+*framework off-heap memory* or *task off-heap memory*, it means that the JVM's *direct memory* limit will be higher.\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> The *network memory* is also part of JVM *direct memory* but it is managed by Flink and guaranteed\n+to never exceed its configured size. Therefore, resizing the *network memory* will not help in this situation.\n+\n+See also [detailed Memory Model](#detailed-memory-model).\n+\n+## Detailed Memory Model\n+\n+This section gives a detailed description of all components in Flink\u2019s memory model.\n+\n+<br />\n+<center>\n+  <img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/fig/detailed-mem-model.svg\" width=\"300px\" alt=\"Simple memory model\"

setups.\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> Neither heap nor off-heap versions of framework and task memory are currently isolated within Flink.\n+The separation of framework and task memory can be used in

The *total Flink memory* consumption includes usage of JVM heap,\n+*managed memory* (managed by Flink) and other direct (or native) memory.\n+\n+<center>\n+  <img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/fig/simple_mem_model.svg\" width=\"300px\" alt=\"Simple memory model\" usemap=\"#simple-mem-model\">\n+</center>\n+<br />\n+\n+If you run FIink locally (e.g. from your IDE) without creating a cluster, then only a subset of the memory configuration\n+options are relevant, see also [local execution](#local-execution) for more details.\n+\n+Otherwise, the simplest way to setup memory in Flink is to configure either of the two following options:\n+* Total Flink memory ([taskmanager.memory.flink.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-flink-size-1))\n+* Total process memory ([taskmanager.memory.process.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-process-size-1))\n+\n+The rest of the memory components will be adjusted automatically, based on default values or additionally configured options.\n+[Here](#detailed-memory-model) are more details about the other memory components.\n+\n+Configuring *total Flink memory* is better suited for standalone deployments where you want to declare how much memory\n+is given to Flink itself. The *total Flink memory* splits up into [managed memory size](#managed-memory) and JVM heap.\n+\n+If you configure *total process memory* you declare how much memory in total should be assigned to the Flink *JVM process*.\n+For the containerized deployments it corresponds to the size of the requested container, see also\n+[how to configure memory for containers](mem_tuning.html#configure-memory-for-containers)\n+([Kubernetes](../deployment/kubernetes.html), [Yarn](../deployment/yarn_setup.html) or [Mesos](../deployment/mesos.html)).\n+\n+Another way to setup the memory is to set [task heap](#task-operator-heap-memory) and [managed memory](#managed-memory)\n+([taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-heap-size) and [taskmanager.memory.managed.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size)).\n+This more fine-grained approach is described in more detail [here](#configure-heap-and-managed-memory).\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> One of the three mentioned ways has to be used to configure Flink\u2019s memory (except for local execution), or the Flink startup will fail.\n+This means that one of the following option subsets, which do not have default values, have to be configured explicitly in *flink-conf.yaml*:\n+* [taskmanager.memory.flink.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-flink-size-1)\n+* [taskmanager.memory.process.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-process-size-1)\n+* [taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-heap-size) and [taskmanager.memory.managed.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size)\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> Explicitly configuring both *total process memory* and *total Flink memory* is not recommended.\n+It may lead to deployment failures due to potential memory configuration conflicts. Additional configuration\n+of other memory components also requires caution as it can produce further configuration conflicts.\n+The conflict can occur e.g. if the sum of sub-components does not add up to the total configured memory or size of some\n+component is outside of its min/max range, see also [the detailed memory model](#detailed-memory-model).\n+\n+## Configure Heap and Managed Memory\n+\n+As mentioned before in [total memory description](#configure-total-memory), another way to setup memory in Flink is\n+to specify explicitly both [task heap](#task-operator-heap-memory) and [managed memory](#managed-memory).\n+It gives more control over the available JVM heap to Flink\u2019s tasks and its [managed memory](#managed-memory).\n+\n+The rest of the memory components will be adjusted automatically, based on default values or additionally configured options.\n+[Here](#detailed-memory-model) are more details about the other memory components.\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> If you have configured the task heap and managed memory explicitly, it is recommended to set neither\n+*total process memory* nor *total Flink memory*. Otherwise, it may easily lead to memory configuration conflicts.\n+\n+### Task (Operator) Heap Memory\n+\n+If you want to guarantee that a certain amount of JVM heap is available for your user code, you can set the *task heap memory*\n+explicitly ([taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-heap-size)).\n+It will be added to the JVM heap size and will be dedicated to Flink\u2019s operators running the user code.\n+\n+### Managed Memory\n+\n+*Managed memory* is managed by Flink and is allocated as native memory (off-heap). The following workloads use *managed memory*:\n+* Streaming jobs can use it for [RocksDB state backend](../state/state_backends.html#the-rocksdbstatebackend).\n+* [Batch jobs](../../dev/batch) can use it for sorting, hash tables, caching of intermediate results.\n+\n+The size of *managed memory* can be\n+* either configured explicitly via [taskmanager.memory.managed.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size)\n+* or computed as a fraction of *total Flink memory* via [taskmanager.memory.managed.fraction](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-fraction)\n+\n+*size* will override *fraction*, if both are set.\n+If neither *size* nor *fraction* is explicitly configured, the [default fraction](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-fraction) will be used.\n+\n+See also [how to configure memory for state backends](mem_tuning.html#configure-memory-for-state-backends) and [batch jobs](mem_tuning.html#configure-memory-for-batch-jobs).\n+\n+## Configure Off-Heap Memory (direct or native)\n+\n+The off-heap memory which is allocated by user code should be accounted for in *task off-heap memory*\n+([taskmanager.memory.task.off-heap.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-off-heap-size)).\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> You can also increase the [framework off-heap memory](#framework-memory). This option is advanced\n+and only recommended to be changed if you are sure that the Flink framework needs more memory.\n+\n+Flink includes the *framework off-heap memory* and *task off-heap memory* into the *direct memory* limit of the JVM,\n+see also [JVM parameters](#jvm-parameters).\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> Although, native non-direct memory usage can be accounted for as a part of the\n+*framework off-heap memory* or *task off-heap memory*, it means that the JVM's *direct memory* limit will be higher.\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> The *network memory* is also part of JVM *direct memory* but it is managed by Flink and guaranteed\n+to never exceed its configured size. Therefore, resizing the *network memory* will not help in this situation.\n+\n+See also [detailed Memory Model](#detailed-memory-model).\n+\n+## Detailed Memory Model\n+\n+This section gives a detailed description of all components in Flink\u2019s memory model.\n+\n+<br />\n+<center>\n+  <img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/fig/detailed-mem-model.svg\" width=\"300px\" alt=\"Simple memory model\"

simply set by the respective option.\n+Other components can be tuned using multiple options.\n+\n+### Framework Memory\n+\n+The *framework heap memory* and *framework off-heap memory* options are not supposed to be changed without a good reason.\n+Adjust them only if you are sure that Flink needs more memory for some internal data structures or operations.\n+It can be related to a particular deployment environment or job structure, like high parallelism.\n+In addition, Flink dependencies, such as Hadoop may consume more direct or native memory in certain setups.\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> Neither heap nor off-heap versions of framework and task memory are currently isolated within Flink.\n+The separation of framework and task memory can be used in future releases for further optimizations.\n+\n+### Capped Fractionated Components\n+\n+This section describes the configuration details of the following options which can be a fraction of a certain\n+[total memory](#configure-total-memory):\n+\n+* *Network memory* can be a fraction of the *total Flink memory*\n+* *JVM overhead* can be a fraction of the *total process memory*\n+\n+See also [detailed memory model](#detailed-memory-model).\n+\n+The size of those components always has to be between its maximum and minimum value, otherwise Flink startup will fail.\n+The maximum and minimum values have defaults or can be explicitly set by corresponding configuration options.\n+Notice if you configure the same maximum and minimum value it effectively means that its size is fixed to that value.\n+For example, if the following options are:\n+- total Flink memory = 1000mb,\n+- network min = 64mb,\n+- network max = 128mb,\n+- network fraction = 0.1\n+\n+then the network memory will be 1000mb x 0.1 = 100Mb which is within the range 64-128Mb.\n+\n+If the component memory is not explicitly configured, then Flink will use the fraction to calculate the memory size\n+based on the total memory. The calculated value is capped by its corresponding min/max options.\n+For example, if the following options are:\n+- total Flink memory = 1000mb,\n+- network min = 128mb,\n+- network max = 256mb,\n+- network fraction = 0.1\n+\n+then the network memory will be 128Mb because the fraction is 100mb and it is less than the minimum.\n+\n+It can also happen that the fraction is ignored if the size of the total memory and its other components is defined.\n+In this case, the network memory is the rest of the total memory. The derived value still has to be within its min/max\n+range otherwise the configuration fails. For example, suppose the following options are set:\n+- total Flink memory = 1000mb,\n+- task heap = 100mb,\n+- network min = 64mb,\n+- network max = 256mb,\n+- network fraction = 0.1\n+\n+All other components of the total Flink memory have default values, including the default managed memory fraction.\n+Then the network memory is not the fraction (1000mb x 0.1 = 100Mb) but the rest of the total Flink memory\n+which will either be within the range 64-256Mb or fail.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "4ff824338b9bee9a678932f6c5bdad6e62582379"}, "originalPosition": 217}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3NDU3MDMyNA==", "bodyText": "I did not want to list all the options (there is also managed memory btw).

Otherwise, it may easily lead to memory configuration conflicts.\n+\n+### Task (Operator) Heap Memory\n+\n+If you want to guarantee that a certain amount of JVM heap is available for your user code, you can set the *task heap memory*\n+explicitly ([taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-heap-size)).\n+It will be added to the JVM heap size and will be dedicated to Flink\u2019s operators running the user code.\n+\n+### Managed Memory\n+\n+*Managed memory* is managed by Flink and is allocated as native memory (off-heap). The following workloads use *managed memory*:\n+* Streaming jobs can use it for [RocksDB state backend](../state/state_backends.html#the-rocksdbstatebackend).\n+* [Batch jobs](../../dev/batch) can use it for sorting, hash tables, caching of intermediate results.\n+\n+The size of *managed memory* can be\n+* either configured explicitly via [taskmanager.memory.managed.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size)\n+* or computed as a fraction of *total Flink memory* via [taskmanager.memory.managed.fraction](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-fraction)\n+\n+*size* will override *fraction*, if both are set.\n+If neither *size* nor *fraction* is explicitly configured, the [default fraction](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-fraction) will be used.\n+\n+See also [how to configure memory for state backends](mem_tuning.html#configure-memory-for-state-backends) and [batch jobs](mem_tuning.html#configure-memory-for-batch-jobs).\n+\n+## Configure Off-Heap Memory (direct or native)\n+\n+The off-heap memory which is allocated by user code should be accounted for in *task off-heap memory*\n+([taskmanager.memory.task.off-heap.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-off-heap-size)).\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> You can also increase the [framework off-heap memory](#framework-memory). This option is advanced\n+and only recommended to be changed if you are sure that the Flink framework needs more memory.\n+\n+Flink includes the *framework off-heap memory* and *task off-heap memory* into the *direct memory* limit of the JVM,\n+see also [JVM parameters](#jvm-parameters).\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> Although, native non-direct memory usage can be accounted for as a part of the\n+*framework off-heap memory* or *task off-heap memory*, it means that the JVM's *direct memory* limit will be higher.\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> The *network memory* is also part of JVM *direct memory* but it is managed by Flink and guaranteed\n+to never exceed its configured size. Therefore, resizing the *network memory* will not help in this situation.\n+\n+See also [detailed Memory Model](#detailed-memory-model).\n+\n+## Detailed Memory Model\n+\n+This section gives a

simply set by the respective option.\n+Other components can be tuned using multiple options.\n+\n+### Framework Memory\n+\n+The *framework heap memory* and *framework off-heap memory* options are not supposed to be changed without a good reason.\n+Adjust them only if you are sure that Flink needs more memory for some internal data structures or operations.\n+It can be related to a particular deployment environment or job structure, like high parallelism.\n+In addition, Flink dependencies, such as Hadoop may consume more direct or native memory in certain setups.\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> Neither heap nor off-heap versions of framework and task memory are currently isolated within Flink.\n+The separation of framework and task memory can be used in future releases for further optimizations.\n+\n+### Capped Fractionated Components\n+\n+This section describes the configuration details of the following options which can be a fraction of a certain\n+[total memory](#configure-total-memory):\n+\n+* *Network memory* can be a fraction of the *total Flink memory*\n+* *JVM overhead* can be a fraction of the *total process memory*\n+\n+See also [detailed memory model](#detailed-memory-model).\n+\n+The size of those components always has to be between its maximum and minimum value, otherwise Flink startup will fail.\n+The maximum and minimum values have defaults or can be explicitly set by corresponding configuration options.\n+Notice if you configure the same maximum and minimum value it effectively means that its size is fixed to that value.\n+For example, if the following options are:\n+- total Flink memory = 1000mb,\n+- network min = 64mb,\n+- network max = 128mb,\n+- network fraction = 0.1\n+\n+then the network memory will be 1000mb x 0.1 = 100Mb which is within the range 64-128Mb.\n+\n+If the component memory is not explicitly configured, then Flink will use the fraction to calculate the memory size\n+based on the total memory. The calculated value is capped by its corresponding min/max options.\n+For example, if the following options are:\n+- total Flink memory = 1000mb,\n+- network min = 128mb,\n+- network max = 256mb,\n+- network fraction = 0.1\n+\n+then the network memory will be 128Mb because the fraction is 100mb and it is less than the minimum.\n+\n+It can also happen that the fraction is ignored if the size of the total memory and its other components is defined.\n+In this case, the network memory is the rest of the total memory. The derived value still has to be within its min/max\n+range otherwise the configuration fails. For example, suppose the following options are set:\n+- total Flink memory = 1000mb,\n+- task heap = 100mb,\n+- network min = 64mb,\n+- network max = 256mb,\n+- network fraction = 0.1\n+\n+All other components of the total Flink memory have default values, including the default managed memory fraction.\n+Then the network memory is not the fraction (1000mb x 0.1 = 100Mb) but the rest of the total Flink memory\n+which will either be within the range 64-256Mb or fail.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3NDQ2NTk4OQ=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "4ff824338b9bee9a678932f6c5bdad6e62582379"}, "originalPosition": 217}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3NTAxNDU1MQ==", "bodyText": "If we don't want to list all the options, we may also say that sum of configured values of the rest options is 600mb, leaving 1000 - 200 - 600 = 200mb for network memory.\nI think the example should be concrete.

The following workloads use *managed memory*:\n+* Streaming jobs can use it for [RocksDB state backend](../state/state_backends.html#the-rocksdbstatebackend).\n+* [Batch jobs](../../dev/batch) can use it for sorting, hash tables, caching of intermediate results.\n+\n+The size of *managed memory* can be\n+* either configured explicitly via [taskmanager.memory.managed.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size)\n+* or computed as a fraction of *total Flink memory* via [taskmanager.memory.managed.fraction](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-fraction)\n+\n+*size* will override *fraction*, if both are set.\n+If neither *size* nor *fraction* is explicitly configured, the [default fraction](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-fraction) will be used.\n+\n+See also [how to configure memory for state backends](mem_tuning.html#configure-memory-for-state-backends) and [batch jobs](mem_tuning.html#configure-memory-for-batch-jobs).\n+\n+## Configure Off-Heap Memory (direct or native)\n+\n+The off-heap memory which is allocated by user code should be accounted for in *task off-heap memory*\n+([taskmanager.memory.task.off-heap.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-off-heap-size)).\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> You can also increase the [framework off-heap memory](#framework-memory). This option is advanced\n+and only recommended to be changed if you are sure that the Flink framework needs more memory.\n+\n+Flink includes the *framework off-heap memory* and *task off-heap memory* into the *direct memory* limit of the JVM,\n+see also [JVM parameters](#jvm-parameters).\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> Although, native non-direct memory usage can be accounted for as a part of the\n+*framework off-heap memory* or *task off-heap memory*, it means that the JVM's *direct memory* limit will be higher.\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> The *network memory* is also part of JVM *direct memory* but it is managed by Flink and guaranteed\n+to never exceed its configured size. Therefore, resizing the *network memory* will not help in this situation.\n+\n+See also [detailed Memory Model](#detailed-memory-model).\n+\n+## Detailed Memory Model\n+\n+This section gives a

simply set by the respective option.\n+Other components can be tuned using multiple options.\n+\n+### Framework Memory\n+\n+The *framework heap memory* and *framework off-heap memory* options are not supposed to be changed without a good reason.\n+Adjust them only if you are sure that Flink needs more memory for some internal data structures or operations.\n+It can be related to a particular deployment environment or job structure, like high parallelism.\n+In addition, Flink dependencies, such as Hadoop may consume more direct or native memory in certain setups.\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> Neither heap nor off-heap versions of framework and task memory are currently isolated within Flink.\n+The separation of framework and task memory can be used in future releases for further optimizations.\n+\n+### Capped Fractionated Components\n+\n+This section describes the configuration details of the following options which can be a fraction of a certain\n+[total memory](#configure-total-memory):\n+\n+* *Network memory* can be a fraction of the *total Flink memory*\n+* *JVM overhead* can be a fraction of the *total process memory*\n+\n+See also [detailed memory model](#detailed-memory-model).\n+\n+The size of those components always has to be between its maximum and minimum value, otherwise Flink startup will fail.\n+The maximum and minimum values have defaults or can be explicitly set by corresponding configuration options.\n+Notice if you configure the same maximum and minimum value it effectively means that its size is fixed to that value.\n+For example, if the following options are:\n+- total Flink memory = 1000mb,\n+- network min = 64mb,\n+- network max = 128mb,\n+- network fraction = 0.1\n+\n+then the network memory will be 1000mb x 0.1 = 100Mb which is within the range 64-128Mb.\n+\n+If the component memory is not explicitly configured, then Flink will use the fraction to calculate the memory size\n+based on the total memory. The calculated value is capped by its corresponding min/max options.\n+For example, if the following options are:\n+- total Flink memory = 1000mb,\n+- network min = 128mb,\n+- network max = 256mb,\n+- network fraction = 0.1\n+\n+then the network memory will be 128Mb because the fraction is 100mb and it is less than the minimum.\n+\n+It can also happen that the fraction is ignored if the size of the total memory and its other components is defined.\n+In this case, the network memory is the rest of the total memory. The derived value still has to be within its min/max\n+range otherwise the configuration fails. For example, suppose the following options are set:\n+- total Flink memory = 1000mb,\n+- task heap = 100mb,\n+- network min = 64mb,\n+- network max = 256mb,\n+- network fraction = 0.1\n+\n+All other components of the total Flink memory have default values, including the default managed memory fraction.\n+Then the network memory is not the fraction (1000mb x 0.1 = 100Mb) but the rest of the total Flink memory\n+which will either be within the range 64-256Mb or fail.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3NDQ2NTk4OQ=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "4ff824338b9bee9a678932f6c5bdad6e62582379"}, "originalPosition": 217}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMjMxNTgzNTM0OnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "docs/ops/memory/mem_setup.md", "isResolved": false, "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMi0wNFQwNDozODo1OVrOFlH5ow==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMi0wNFQwNDozODo1OVrOFlH5ow==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3NDQ3MTA3NQ==", "bodyText": "This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

The *total Flink memory* splits up into [managed memory size](#managed-memory) and JVM heap.\n+\n+If you configure *total process memory* you declare how much memory in total should be assigned to the Flink *JVM process*.\n+For the containerized deployments it corresponds to the size of the requested container, see also\n+[how to configure memory for containers](mem_tuning.html#configure-memory-for-containers)\n+([Kubernetes](../deployment/kubernetes.html), [Yarn](../deployment/yarn_setup.html) or [Mesos](../deployment/mesos.html)).\n+\n+Another way to setup the memory is to set [task heap](#task-operator-heap-memory) and [managed memory](#managed-memory)\n+([taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-heap-size) and [taskmanager.memory.managed.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size)).\n+This more fine-grained approach is described in more detail [here](#configure-heap-and-managed-memory).\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> One of the three mentioned ways has to be used to configure Flink\u2019s memory (except for local execution), or the Flink startup will fail.\n+This means that one of the following option subsets, which do not have default values, have to be configured explicitly in *flink-conf.yaml*:\n+* [taskmanager.memory.flink.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-flink-size-1)\n+* [taskmanager.memory.process.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-process-size-1)\n+* [taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-heap-size) and [taskmanager.memory.managed.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size)\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> Explicitly configuring both *total process memory* and *total Flink memory* is not recommended.\n+It may lead to deployment failures due to potential memory configuration conflicts. Additional configuration\n+of other memory components also requires caution as it can produce further configuration conflicts.\n+The conflict can occur e.g. if the sum of sub-components does not add up to the total configured memory or size of some\n+component is outside of its min/max range, see also [the detailed memory model](#detailed-memory-model).\n+\n+## Configure Heap and Managed Memory\n+\n+As mentioned before in [total memory description](#configure-total-memory), another way to setup memory in Flink is\n+to specify explicitly both [task heap](#task-operator-heap-memory) and [managed memory](#managed-memory).\n+It gives more control over the available JVM heap to Flink\u2019s tasks and its [managed memory](#managed-memory).\n+\n+The rest of the memory components will be adjusted automatically, based on default values or additionally configured options.\n+[Here](#detailed-memory-model) are more details about the other memory components.\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> If you have configured the task heap and managed memory explicitly, it is recommended to set neither\n+*total process memory* nor *total Flink memory*. Otherwise, it may easily lead to memory configuration conflicts.\n+\n+### Task (Operator) Heap Memory\n+\n+If you want to guarantee that a certain amount of JVM heap is available for your user code, you can set the *task heap memory*\n+explicitly ([taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-heap-size)).\n+It will be added to the JVM heap size and will be dedicated to Flink\u2019s operators running the user code.\n+\n+### Managed Memory\n+\n+*Managed memory* is managed by Flink and is allocated as native memory (off-heap). The following workloads use *managed memory*:\n+* Streaming jobs can use it for [RocksDB state backend](../state/state_backends.html#the-rocksdbstatebackend).\n+* [Batch jobs](../../dev/batch) can use it for sorting, hash tables, caching of intermediate results.\n+\n+The size of *managed memory* can be\n+* either configured explicitly via [taskmanager.memory.managed.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size)\n+* or computed as a fraction of *total Flink memory* via [taskmanager.memory.managed.fraction](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-fraction)\n+\n+*size* will override *fraction*, if both are set.\n+If neither *size* nor *fraction* is explicitly configured, the [default fraction](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-fraction) will be used.\n+\n+See also [how to configure memory for state backends](mem_tuning.html#configure-memory-for-state-backends) and [batch jobs](mem_tuning.html#configure-memory-for-batch-jobs).\n+\n+## Configure Off-Heap Memory (direct or native)\n+\n+The off-heap memory which is allocated by user code should be accounted for in *task off-heap memory*\n+([taskmanager.memory.task.off-heap.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-off-heap-size)).\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> You can also increase the [framework off-heap memory](#framework-memory). This option is advanced\n+and only recommended to be changed if you are sure that the Flink framework needs more memory.\n+\n+Flink includes the *framework off-heap memory* and *task off-heap memory* into the *direct memory* limit of the JVM,\n+see also [JVM parameters](#jvm-parameters).\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> Although, native non-direct memory usage can be accounted for as a part of the\n+*framework off-heap memory* or *task off-heap memory*, it means that the JVM's *direct memory* limit will be higher.\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> The *network memory* is also part of JVM *direct memory* but it is managed by Flink and guaranteed\n+to never exceed its configured size. Therefore, resizing the *network memory* will not help in this situation.\n+\n+See also [detailed Memory Model](#detailed-memory-model).\n+\n+## Detailed Memory Model\n+\n+This section gives a

etc, it is a [capped fractionated component](#capped-fractionated-components) of the [total process memory](#configure-total-memory)    |\n+\n+As you can see, the size of some memory components can be simply set by the respective option.\n+Other components can be tuned using multiple options.\n+\n+### Framework Memory\n+\n+The *framework heap memory* and *framework off-heap memory* options are not supposed to be changed without a good reason.\n+Adjust them only if you are sure that Flink needs more memory for some internal data structures or operations.\n+It can be related to a particular deployment environment or job structure, like high parallelism.\n+In addition, Flink dependencies, such as Hadoop may consume more direct or native memory in certain setups.\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> Neither heap nor off-heap versions of framework and task memory are currently isolated within Flink.\n+The separation of framework and task memory can be used in future releases for further optimizations.\n+\n+### Capped Fractionated Components\n+\n+This section describes the configuration details of the following options which can be a fraction of a certain\n+[total memory](#configure-total-memory):\n+\n+* *Network memory* can be a fraction of the *total Flink memory*\n+* *JVM overhead* can be a fraction of the *total process memory*\n+\n+See also [detailed memory model](#detailed-memory-model).\n+\n+The size of those components always has to be between its maximum and minimum value, otherwise Flink startup will fail.\n+The maximum and minimum values have defaults or can be explicitly set by corresponding configuration options.\n+Notice if you configure the same maximum and minimum value it effectively means that its size is fixed to that value.\n+For example, if the following options are:\n+- total Flink memory = 1000mb,\n+- network min = 64mb,\n+- network max = 128mb,\n+- network fraction = 0.1\n+\n+then the network memory will be 1000mb x 0.1 = 100Mb which is within the range 64-128Mb.\n+\n+If the component memory is not explicitly configured, then Flink will use the fraction to calculate the memory size\n+based on the total memory. The calculated value is capped by its corresponding min/max options.\n+For example, if the following options are:\n+- total Flink memory = 1000mb,\n+- network min = 128mb,\n+- network max = 256mb,\n+- network fraction = 0.1\n+\n+then the network memory will be 128Mb because the fraction is 100mb and it is less than the minimum.\n+\n+It can also happen that the fraction is ignored if the size of the total memory and its other components is defined.\n+In this case, the network memory is the rest of the total memory. The derived value still has to be within its min/max\n+range otherwise the configuration fails. For example, suppose the following options are set:\n+- total Flink memory = 1000mb,\n+- task heap = 100mb,\n+- network min = 64mb,\n+- network max = 256mb,\n+- network fraction = 0.1\n+\n+All other components of the total Flink memory have default values, including the default managed memory fraction.\n+Then the network memory is not the fraction (1000mb x 0.1 = 100Mb) but the rest of the total Flink memory\n+which will either be within the range 64-256Mb or fail.\n+\n+## JVM Parameters\n+\n+Flink explicitly adds the following memory related JVM arguments while starting the task executor process,\n+based on the configured or derived memory component sizes:\n+\n+| **JVM Arguments**         | **Value**                                  |\n+| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------- |\n+| *-Xmx* and *-Xms*         | Framework + Task Heap Memory               |\n+| *-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize* | Framework + Task Off-Heap + Network Memory |\n+| *-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize*    | JVM Metaspace                              |\n+\n+See also [detailed memory model](#detailed-memory-model).\n+\n+## Local Execution\n+If you start Flink locally on your machine as a single java program without creating a cluster (e.g. from your IDE)\n+then all components are ignored except for the following:\n+\n+| **Memory component**     | **Relevant options**                                                                          | **Default value for the local execution**                                     |\n+| :----------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n+| Task heap                | [taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-heap-size)         | infinite                                                                      |\n+| Task off-heap            | [taskmanager.memory.task.off-heap.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-off-heap-size) | infinite                                                                      |\n+| Managed memory           | [taskmanager.memory.managed.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size)             | 128Mb                                                                         |\n+| Network memory           | [taskmanager.memory.network.min](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-network-min) <br /> [taskmanager.memory.network.max](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-network-max) | 64Mb |\n+\n+All of the components listed above can be but do not have to be explicitly configured for the local execution.\n+If they are not configured they are set to their default values.

This guide will help you to understand how to migrate the previous memory configuration to the new one.\n+\n+* toc\n+{:toc}\n+\n+<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n+  <strong>Warning:</strong> It is important to review this guide because the legacy and new memory configuration can\n+  result in different sizes of memory components. If you try to reuse your Flink configuration from the previous versions\n+  before 1.10, it can result in changes to the behavior, performance or even configuration failures of your application.\n+</div>\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> The previous memory configuration allows that no memory related options are set at all\n+as they all have default values. The [new memory configuration](mem_setup.html#configure-total-memory) requires\n+that at least one subset of the following options is configured explicitly, otherwise the configuration will fail:\n+* [taskmanager.memory.flink.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-flink-size-1)\n+* [taskmanager.memory.process.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-process-size-1)\n+* [taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-heap-size) and [taskmanager.memory.managed.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size)\n+\n+The [default \u2018flink-conf.yaml\u2019](#default-configuration-in-flink-confyaml) shipped with Flink sets [taskmanager.memory.process.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-process-size-1)\n+to make the default memory configuration consistent.\n+\n+This [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mJaMkMPfDJJ-w6nMXALYmTc4XxiV30P5U7DzgwLkSoE) can also help\n+to evaluate and compare the results of the legacy and new memory computations.\n+\n+## Changes in Configuration Options\n+\n+This chapter shortly lists all changes in the memory configuration options before the 1.10 release.\n+It also references other chapters for more details about the migration to the new configuration options.\n+\n+The following options are completely removed.

The options have been deprecated.\n+\n+The Mesos integration also had a separate option with the same semantics: \u2018mesos.resourcemanager.tasks.mem\u2019 which has also been deprecated.\n+\n+If the mentioned legacy options are used without specifying the corresponding new options,\n+they will be directly translated into the following new options:\n+* Total Flink memory ([taskmanager.memory.flink.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-flink-size-1)) for standalone deployments\n+* Total process memory ([taskmanager.memory.process.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-process-size-1)) for containerized deployments (Yarn or Mesos)\n+\n+It is also recommended to use these new options instead of the legacy ones as they might be completely removed in the following releases.\n+\n+See also [how to configure total memory now](mem_setup.html#configure-total-memory).\n+\n+## JVM Heap Memory\n+\n+JVM heap memory previously consisted of the managed memory (if configured to be on-heap) and the rest\n+which included any other usages of heap memory. This rest was always implicitly derived as the remaining part of the total memory,\n+see also [how to migrate managed memory](#managed-memory).\n+\n+Now, if only *total Flink memory* or *total process memory* is configured, then the JVM heap is also derived as the rest of\n+what is left after subtracting all other components from the total memory, see also [how to configure total memory](mem_setup.html#configure-total-memory).\n+\n+Additionally, you can now have more direct control over the JVM heap assigned to the operator tasks\n+([taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-heap-size)),\n+see also [Task (Operator) Heap Memory](mem_setup.html#task-operator-heap-memory).\n+The same memory has to be accounted for the heap state backend ([MemoryStateBackend](../state/state_backends.html#the-memorystatebackend)\n+or [FsStateBackend](../state/state_backends.html#the-fsstatebackend) if it is chosen for streaming jobs.\n+\n+A part of the JVM heap is now always reserved for Flink framework\n+([taskmanager.memory.framework.heap.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-framework-heap-size)).\n+See also [Framework memory](mem_setup.html#framework-memory).\n+\n+## Managed Memory\n+\n+See also [how to configure managed memory now](mem_setup.html#managed-memory).\n+\n+### Explicit size\n+\n+The previous option to configure managed memory size (\u2018taskmanager.memory.size\u2019) was renamed to\n+[taskmanager.memory.managed.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size) and deprecated.\n+It is recommended to use the new option because the legacy one can be removed in future releases.\n+\n+### Fraction\n+\n+If not set explicitly, the managed memory could be previously specified as a fraction (\u2018taskmanager.memory.fraction\u2019)\n+of the total memory minus network memory and container cut-off (only for [Yarn](../deployment/yarn_setup.html) and\n+[Mesos](../deployment/mesos.html) deployments). This option has been completely removed and will have no effect if still used.\n+Please, use the new option [taskmanager.memory.managed.fraction](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-fraction) instead.\n+This new option will set the [managed memory](mem_setup.html#managed-memory) to the specified fraction of the\n+[total Flink memory](mem_setup.html#configure-total-memory) if its size is not set explicitly by\n+[taskmanager.memory.managed.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size).\n+\n+### RocksDB state\n+\n+If the [RocksDBStateBackend](../state/state_backends.html#the-rocksdbstatebackend) is chosen for a streaming job,\n+its native memory consumption should now be accounted for in [managed memory](mem_setup.html#managed-memory).\n+The RocksDB memory allocation is limited by the [managed memory](mem_setup.html#managed-memory) size.\n+This should prevent the killing of containers on [Yarn](../deployment/yarn_setup.html) or [Mesos](../deployment/mesos.html).\n+See also [how to migrate container cut-off](#container-cut-off-memory).\n+\n+### Other changes\n+\n+Additionally, the following changes have been made:\n+* The [managed memory](mem_setup.html#managed-memory) is always off-heap now. The configuration option \u2018taskmanager.memory.off-heap\u2019 is removed and will have no effect anymore.\n+* The [managed memory](mem_setup.html#managed-memory) now uses native memory which is not direct memory. It means that the managed memory is no longer accounted for in the JVM direct memory limit.\n+* The [managed memory](mem_setup.html#managed-memory) is always lazily allocated now. The configuration option \u2018taskmanager.memory.preallocate\u2019 is removed and will have no effect anymore.\n+\n+## Container Cut-Off Memory\n+\n+For containerized deployments, you could previously specify a cut-off memory. This memory could accommodate for unaccounted memory allocations.\n+Dependencies which were not directly controlled by Flink were the main source of those allocations, e.g. RocksDB, internals of JVM etc.\n+This is no longer available and the related configuration options (\u2018containerized.heap-cutoff-ratio\u2019 and \u2018containerized.heap-cutoff-min\u2019)\n+will have no effect on the task manager process anymore. The new memory model introduced more specific memory components,\n+described further, to address these concerns.\n+\n+In streaming jobs which use [RocksDBStateBackend](../state/state_backends.html#the-rocksdbstatebackend), the RocksDB\n+native memory consumption should be accounted for as a part of the [managed memory](mem_setup.html#managed-memory) now.\n+The RocksDB memory allocation is also limited by the configured size of the [managed memory](mem_setup.html#managed-memory).\n+See also [migrating managed memory](#managed-memory) and [how to configure managed memory now](mem_setup.html#managed-memory).\n+\n+The other specific consumption of direct or native off-heap memory can be now addressed by the following new configuration options:\n+* Task off-heap memory ([taskmanager.memory.task.off-heap.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-off-heap-size))\n+* Framework off-heap memory ([taskmanager.memory.framework.off-heap.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-framework-off-heap-size))\n+* JVM metaspace ([taskmanager.memory.jvm-metaspace.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-jvm-metaspace-size))\n+* JVM overhead (see also [detailed new memory model](mem_setup.html#detailed-memory-model))\n+\n+<strong>Note:</strong> The job manager still has container cut-off memory configuration options.\n+The mentioned configuration options remain valid for the job manager in the same way as before.\n+\n+## Default Configuration in flink-conf.yaml\n+\n+This section describes the changes of the default \u2018flink-conf.yaml\u2019 shipped with Flink.\n+\n+The total memory (\u2018taskmanager.heap.size\u2019) is replaced by [taskmanager.memory.process.size](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-process-size-1)", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "4ff824338b9bee9a678932f6c5bdad6e62582379"}, "originalPosition": 177}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMjMxNTkxNDA1OnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "docs/ops/state/state_backends.md", "isResolved": false, "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMi0wNFQwNTo0MDo0M1rOFlIoPg==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMi0wNFQwNTo0MDo0M1rOFlIoPg==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3NDQ4MzAwNg==", "bodyText": "This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

The configuration option \u2018taskmanager.memory.off-heap\u2019 is removed and will have no effect anymore.\n+* The [managed memory](mem_setup.html#managed-memory) now uses native memory which is not direct memory. It means that the managed memory is no longer accounted for in the JVM direct memory limit.\n+* The [managed memory](mem_setup.html#managed-memory) is always lazily allocated now. The configuration option \u2018taskmanager.memory.preallocate\u2019 is removed and will have no effect anymore.\n+\n+## Container Cut-Off Memory\n+\n+For containerized deployments, you could previously specify a cut-off memory. This memory could accommodate for unaccounted memory allocations.\n+Dependencies which were not directly controlled by Flink were the main source of those allocations, e.g. RocksDB, internals of JVM etc.\n+This is no longer available and the related configuration options (`containerized.heap-cutoff-ratio` and `containerized.heap-cutoff-min`)\n+will have no effect on the task manager process anymore. The new memory model introduced more specific memory components,\n+described further, to address these concerns.\n+\n+In streaming jobs which use [RocksDBStateBackend](../state/state_backends.html#the-rocksdbstatebackend), the RocksDB\n+native memory consumption should be accounted for as a part of the [managed memory](mem_setup.html#managed-memory) now.\n+The RocksDB memory allocation is also limited by the configured size of the [managed memory](mem_setup.html#managed-memory).\n+See also [migrating managed memory](#managed-memory) and [how to configure managed memory now](mem_setup.html#managed-memory).\n+\n+The other specific consumption of direct or native off-heap memory can be now addressed by the following new configuration options:\n+* Task off-heap memory ([`taskmanager.memory.task.off-heap.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-off-heap-size))\n+* Framework off-heap memory ([`taskmanager.memory.framework.off-heap.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-framework-off-heap-size))\n+* JVM metaspace ([`taskmanager.memory.jvm-metaspace.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-jvm-metaspace-size))\n+* JVM overhead (see also [detailed new memory model](mem_setup.html#detailed-memory-model))\n+\n+<span class=\"label label-info\">Note</span> The job manager still has container cut-off memory configuration options.\n+The mentioned configuration options remain valid for the job manager in the same way as before.\n+\n+## Default Configuration in flink-conf.yaml\n+\n+This section describes the changes of the default \u2018flink-conf.yaml\u2019 shipped with Flink.\n+\n+The total memory (\u2018taskmanager.heap.size\u2019) is replaced by [`taskmanager.memory.process.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-process-size)", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "16eeb758a4c5908166bf135e66f989611c268634"}, "originalPosition": 227}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3NjQ0NjkzMg==", "bodyText": "Indeed, I overlooked old options w/o links", "url": "https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/10999#discussion_r376446932", "createdAt": "2020-02-07T15:20:26Z", "author": {"login": "azagrebin"}, "path": "docs/ops/memory/mem_migration.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,234 @@\n+---\n+title: \"Migration from old configuration (before 1.10 release)\"\n+nav-parent_id: ops_mem\n+nav-pos: 5\n+---\n+<!--\n+Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\n+or more contributor license agreements.

See also [how to migrate container cut-off](#container-cut-off-memory).\n+\n+## Total Memory (previously Heap Memory)\n+\n+The previous options which were responsible for the total memory used by Flink are \u2018taskmanager.heap.size\u2019 or \u2018taskmanager.heap.mb\u2019.\n+Despite their naming, they included not only JVM heap but also other off-heap memory components. The options have been deprecated.\n+\n+The Mesos integration also had a separate option with the same semantics: \u2018mesos.resourcemanager.tasks.mem\u2019 which has also been deprecated.\n+\n+If the mentioned legacy options are used without specifying the corresponding new options,\n+they will be directly translated into the following new options:\n+* Total Flink memory ([`taskmanager.memory.flink.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-flink-size)) for standalone deployments\n+* Total process memory ([`taskmanager.memory.process.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-process-size)) for containerized deployments (Yarn or Mesos)\n+\n+It is also recommended to use these new options instead of the legacy ones as they might be completely removed in the following releases.\n+\n+See also [how to configure total memory now](mem_setup.html#configure-total-memory).\n+\n+## JVM Heap Memory\n+\n+JVM heap memory previously consisted of the managed memory (if configured to be on-heap) and the rest\n+which included any other usages of heap memory. This rest was always implicitly derived as the remaining part of the total memory,\n+see also [how to migrate managed memory](#managed-memory).\n+\n+Now, if only *total Flink memory* or *total process memory* is configured, then the JVM heap is also derived as the rest of\n+what is left after subtracting all other components from the total memory, see also [how to configure total memory](mem_setup.html#configure-total-memory).\n+\n+Additionally, you can now have more direct control over the JVM heap assigned to the operator tasks\n+([`taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-heap-size)),\n+see also [Task (Operator) Heap Memory](mem_setup.html#task-operator-heap-memory).\n+The same memory has to be accounted for the heap state backend ([MemoryStateBackend](../state/state_backends.html#the-memorystatebackend)\n+or [FsStateBackend](../state/state_backends.html#the-fsstatebackend) if it is chosen for streaming jobs.\n+\n+A part of the JVM heap is now always reserved for Flink framework\n+([`taskmanager.memory.framework.heap.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-framework-heap-size)).\n+See also [Framework memory](mem_setup.html#framework-memory).\n+\n+## Managed Memory\n+\n+See also [how to configure managed memory now](mem_setup.html#managed-memory).\n+\n+### Explicit size\n+\n+The previous option to configure managed memory size (\u2018taskmanager.memory.size\u2019) was renamed to\n+[`taskmanager.memory.managed.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size) and deprecated.\n+It is recommended to use the new option because the legacy one can be removed in future releases.\n+\n+### Fraction\n+\n+If not set explicitly, the managed memory could be previously specified as a fraction (\u2018taskmanager.memory.fraction\u2019)\n+of the total memory minus network memory and container cut-off (only for [Yarn](../deployment/yarn_setup.html) and\n+[Mesos](../deployment/mesos.html) deployments). This option has been completely removed and will have no effect if still used.\n+Please, use the new option [`taskmanager.memory.managed.fraction`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-fraction) instead.\n+This new option will set the [managed memory](mem_setup.html#managed-memory) to the specified fraction of the\n+[total Flink memory](mem_setup.html#configure-total-memory) if its size is not set explicitly by\n+[`taskmanager.memory.managed.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size).\n+\n+### RocksDB state\n+\n+If the [RocksDBStateBackend](../state/state_backends.html#the-rocksdbstatebackend) is chosen for a streaming job,\n+its native memory consumption should now be accounted for in [managed memory](mem_setup.html#managed-memory).\n+The RocksDB memory allocation is limited by the [managed memory](mem_setup.html#managed-memory) size.\n+This should prevent the killing of containers on [Yarn](../deployment/yarn_setup.html) or [Mesos](../deployment/mesos.html).\n+See also [how to migrate container cut-off](#container-cut-off-memory).\n+\n+### Other changes\n+\n+Additionally, the following changes have been made:\n+* The [managed memory](mem_setup.html#managed-memory) is always off-heap now. The configuration option \u2018taskmanager.memory.off-heap\u2019 is removed and will have no effect anymore.\n+* The [managed memory](mem_setup.html#managed-memory) now uses native memory which is not direct memory. It means that the managed memory is no longer accounted for in the JVM direct memory limit.\n+* The [managed memory](mem_setup.html#managed-memory) is always lazily allocated now. The configuration option \u2018taskmanager.memory.preallocate\u2019 is removed and will have no effect anymore.\n+\n+## Container Cut-Off Memory\n+\n+For containerized deployments, you could previously specify a cut-off memory.

See also [how to migrate container cut-off](#container-cut-off-memory).\n+\n+## Total Memory (previously Heap Memory)\n+\n+The previous options which were responsible for the total memory used by Flink are \u2018taskmanager.heap.size\u2019 or \u2018taskmanager.heap.mb\u2019.\n+Despite their naming, they included not only JVM heap but also other off-heap memory components. The options have been deprecated.\n+\n+The Mesos integration also had a separate option with the same semantics: \u2018mesos.resourcemanager.tasks.mem\u2019 which has also been deprecated.\n+\n+If the mentioned legacy options are used without specifying the corresponding new options,\n+they will be directly translated into the following new options:\n+* Total Flink memory ([`taskmanager.memory.flink.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-flink-size)) for standalone deployments\n+* Total process memory ([`taskmanager.memory.process.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-process-size)) for containerized deployments (Yarn or Mesos)\n+\n+It is also recommended to use these new options instead of the legacy ones as they might be completely removed in the following releases.\n+\n+See also [how to configure total memory now](mem_setup.html#configure-total-memory).\n+\n+## JVM Heap Memory\n+\n+JVM heap memory previously consisted of the managed memory (if configured to be on-heap) and the rest\n+which included any other usages of heap memory. This rest was always implicitly derived as the remaining part of the total memory,\n+see also [how to migrate managed memory](#managed-memory).\n+\n+Now, if only *total Flink memory* or *total process memory* is configured, then the JVM heap is also derived as the rest of\n+what is left after subtracting all other components from the total memory, see also [how to configure total memory](mem_setup.html#configure-total-memory).\n+\n+Additionally, you can now have more direct control over the JVM heap assigned to the operator tasks\n+([`taskmanager.memory.task.heap.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-heap-size)),\n+see also [Task (Operator) Heap Memory](mem_setup.html#task-operator-heap-memory).\n+The same memory has to be accounted for the heap state backend ([MemoryStateBackend](../state/state_backends.html#the-memorystatebackend)\n+or [FsStateBackend](../state/state_backends.html#the-fsstatebackend) if it is chosen for streaming jobs.\n+\n+A part of the JVM heap is now always reserved for Flink framework\n+([`taskmanager.memory.framework.heap.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-framework-heap-size)).\n+See also [Framework memory](mem_setup.html#framework-memory).\n+\n+## Managed Memory\n+\n+See also [how to configure managed memory now](mem_setup.html#managed-memory).\n+\n+### Explicit size\n+\n+The previous option to configure managed memory size (\u2018taskmanager.memory.size\u2019) was renamed to\n+[`taskmanager.memory.managed.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size) and deprecated.\n+It is recommended to use the new option because the legacy one can be removed in future releases.\n+\n+### Fraction\n+\n+If not set explicitly, the managed memory could be previously specified as a fraction (\u2018taskmanager.memory.fraction\u2019)\n+of the total memory minus network memory and container cut-off (only for [Yarn](../deployment/yarn_setup.html) and\n+[Mesos](../deployment/mesos.html) deployments). This option has been completely removed and will have no effect if still used.\n+Please, use the new option [`taskmanager.memory.managed.fraction`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-fraction) instead.\n+This new option will set the [managed memory](mem_setup.html#managed-memory) to the specified fraction of the\n+[total Flink memory](mem_setup.html#configure-total-memory) if its size is not set explicitly by\n+[`taskmanager.memory.managed.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-managed-size).\n+\n+### RocksDB state\n+\n+If the [RocksDBStateBackend](../state/state_backends.html#the-rocksdbstatebackend) is chosen for a streaming job,\n+its native memory consumption should now be accounted for in [managed memory](mem_setup.html#managed-memory).\n+The RocksDB memory allocation is limited by the [managed memory](mem_setup.html#managed-memory) size.\n+This should prevent the killing of containers on [Yarn](../deployment/yarn_setup.html) or [Mesos](../deployment/mesos.html).\n+See also [how to migrate container cut-off](#container-cut-off-memory).\n+\n+### Other changes\n+\n+Additionally, the following changes have been made:\n+* The [managed memory](mem_setup.html#managed-memory) is always off-heap now. The configuration option \u2018taskmanager.memory.off-heap\u2019 is removed and will have no effect anymore.\n+* The [managed memory](mem_setup.html#managed-memory) now uses native memory which is not direct memory. It means that the managed memory is no longer accounted for in the JVM direct memory limit.\n+* The [managed memory](mem_setup.html#managed-memory) is always lazily allocated now. The configuration option \u2018taskmanager.memory.preallocate\u2019 is removed and will have no effect anymore.\n+\n+## Container Cut-Off Memory\n+\n+For containerized deployments, you could previously specify a cut-off memory. This memory could accommodate for unaccounted memory allocations.\n+Dependencies which were not directly controlled by Flink were the main source of those allocations, e.g. RocksDB, internals of JVM etc.\n+This is no longer available and the related configuration options (`containerized.heap-cutoff-ratio` and `containerized.heap-cutoff-min`)\n+will have no effect on the task manager process anymore. The new memory model introduced more specific memory components,\n+described further, to address these concerns.\n+\n+In streaming jobs which use [RocksDBStateBackend](../state/state_backends.html#the-rocksdbstatebackend), the RocksDB\n+native memory consumption should be accounted for as a part of the [managed memory](mem_setup.html#managed-memory) now.\n+The RocksDB memory allocation is also limited by the configured size of the [managed memory](mem_setup.html#managed-memory).\n+See also [migrating managed memory](#managed-memory) and [how to configure managed memory now](mem_setup.html#managed-memory).\n+\n+The other specific consumption of direct or native off-heap memory can be now addressed by the following new configuration options:\n+* Task off-heap memory ([`taskmanager.memory.task.off-heap.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-task-off-heap-size))\n+* Framework off-heap memory ([`taskmanager.memory.framework.off-heap.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-framework-off-heap-size))\n+* JVM metaspace ([`taskmanager.memory.jvm-metaspace.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-jvm-metaspace-size))\n+* JVM overhead (see also [detailed new memory model](mem_setup.html#detailed-memory-model))\n+\n+<span class=\"label label-info\">Note</span> The job manager still has container cut-off memory configuration options.\n+The mentioned configuration options remain valid for the job manager in the same way as before.\n+\n+## Default Configuration in flink-conf.yaml\n+\n+This section describes the changes of the default \u2018flink-conf.yaml\u2019 shipped with Flink.\n+\n+The total memory (\u2018taskmanager.heap.size\u2019) is replaced by [`taskmanager.memory.process.size`](../config.html#taskmanager-memory-process-size)\n+in the default \u2018flink-conf.yaml\u2019.
