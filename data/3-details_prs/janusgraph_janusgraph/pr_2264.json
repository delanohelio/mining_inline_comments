{"data": {"repository": {"pullRequest": {"id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTMzMTMwMjg4", "number": 2264, "title": "Rewrite testConcurrentConsistencyEnforcement to properly test lock contention", "bodyText": "The old test fails to test the locking mechanism because one thread runs so fast such that other threads often fail before they commit. To properly test lock contention, we need to let them commit together. Note that this test still can only test local lock contention (threads running on the same process), but not the case where transactions running on different JVMs compete for locks.\n\nThank you for contributing to JanusGraph!\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\nFor all changes:\n\n Is there an issue associated with this PR? Is it referenced in the commit message?\n Does your PR body contain #xyz where xyz is the issue number you are trying to resolve?\n Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically master)?\n Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit?\n\nFor code changes:\n\n Have you written and/or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\n If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under ASF 2.0?\n If applicable, have you updated the LICENSE.txt file, including the main LICENSE.txt file in the root of this repository?\n If applicable, have you updated the NOTICE.txt file, including the main NOTICE.txt file found in the root of this repository?\n\nFor documentation related changes:\n\n Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\n If this PR is a documentation-only change, have you added a [doc only]\ntag to the first line of your commit message to avoid spending CPU cycles in\nTravis CI when no code, tests, or build configuration are modified?\n\nNote:\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check Travis CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.", "createdAt": "2020-12-06T03:09:23Z", "url": "https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/pull/2264", "merged": true,
