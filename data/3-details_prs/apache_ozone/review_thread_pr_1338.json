After this, ReplicaManager will do additionally container empty check for all healthy containers. Not sure if this is an efficiency way to put logic here.\n\nI wonder if it would be simpler to remove empty containers as part of Container Report processing? In AbstractContainerReportHandler#updateContainerState, we could check the size and number of keys of the reported containers in the CLOSED branch of the switch statement, and then take action to delete an empty container there? I have a feeling it might be simpler, but I am not sure. The disadvantage of doing it in the Container Report Processing, is that we are dealing with only a single replica at that stage. However if the container is CLOSED in SCM, and a report says it is empty then we should be good to simply remove the container from SCM and issue the delete container command when processing the container report.\n\nActually I prefer this way as @sodonnel mentioned.\n\nbut I am not sure. The disadvantage of doing it in the Container Report Processing, is that we are dealing with only a single replica at that stage\n\nWe could also get all replica info and check state in ContainerReportHandler, then send delete container command\nI'm okay for current way but just share my thought for this.", "url": "https://github.com/apache/ozone/pull/1338#discussion_r496544696", "createdAt": "2020-09-29T08:45:15Z", "author": {"login": "linyiqun"}, "path": "hadoop-hdds/server-scm/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hdds/scm/container/ReplicationManager.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -320,6 +331,12 @@ private void processContainer(ContainerID id) {\n        * exact number of replicas in the same state.\n        */\n       if (isContainerHealthy(container, replicas)) {\n+        /*\n+         *  If container is empty, schedule task to delete the container.\n+         */\n+        if (isContainerEmpty(container, replicas)) {\n+          deleteContainerReplicas(container, replicas);\n+        }", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "cd93423b03095ae95e8fa2b9f5410adb93b310e1"}, "originalPosition": 43}]}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 3902, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-12T11:57:46Z"}}}
