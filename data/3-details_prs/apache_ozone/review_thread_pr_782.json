I am not sure why the second character of snprintf here is len+5, I see that there are two extra dots in the host, but that does not explain 5. Can you explain this a bit better in the code, with like naming it and extracting it to a local variable, or by adding a comment, that would help to understand that a bit easier.", "url": "https://github.com/apache/ozone/pull/782#discussion_r405500452", "createdAt": "2020-04-08T12:52:58Z", "author": {"login": "fapifta"}, "path": "hadoop-ozone/native-client/libozone/ozfs.c", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,42 @@\n+#include \"ozfs.h\"\n+#include \"hdfs/hdfs.h\"\n+#include <fcntl.h>\n+#include <inttypes.h>\n+#include <stdio.h>\n+#include <string.h>\n+\n+\n+ozfsFS ozfsConnect(const char *host, tPort port, const char *bucket, const char *vol)\n+{\n+    struct hdfsBuilder *bld = hdfsNewBuilder();\n+    char string[100] = \"\";\n+    int len = 0;\n+    if (!bld)\n+        return NULL;\n+    len = strlen(host) + strlen(bucket) + strlen(vol) + strlen(\"o3fs://\");\n+    snprintf(string, len + 5, \"o3fs://%s.%s.%s\", bucket, vol, host);", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "3fd20edc3b7219b1972946a02601c9adf9b69047"}, "originalPosition": 17}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwNTU0OTcwMw==", "bodyText": "Thanks for pointing out @fapifta\nI changed len+5 to len+3 (len+2 for the two dots and +1 for the null character that\u2019s being appended by snprintf).\nAlso I changed string[100] to string[len+2].", "url": "https://github.com/apache/ozone/pull/782#discussion_r405549703", "createdAt": "2020-04-08T14:03:05Z", "author": {"login": "aryangupta1998"}, "path": "hadoop-ozone/native-client/libozone/ozfs.c", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,42 @@\n+#include \"ozfs.h\"\n+#include \"hdfs/hdfs.h\"\n+#include <fcntl.h>\n+#include <inttypes.h>\n+#include <stdio.h>\n+#include <string.h>\n+\n+\n+ozfsFS ozfsConnect(const char *host, tPort port, const char *bucket, const char *vol)\n+{\n+    struct hdfsBuilder *bld = hdfsNewBuilder();\n+    char string[100] = \"\";\n+    int len = 0;\n+    if (!bld)\n+        return NULL;\n+    len = strlen(host) + strlen(bucket) + strlen(vol) + strlen(\"o3fs://\");\n+    snprintf(string, len + 5, \"o3fs://%s.%s.%s\", bucket, vol, host);", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwNTUwMDQ1Mg=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "3fd20edc3b7219b1972946a02601c9adf9b69047"}, "originalPosition": 17}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMjUxNjM4OTk1OnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "hadoop-ozone/native-client/README.md", "isResolved": true, "comments": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNC0wOFQxMzowMDo1N1rOGCuF8Q==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNC0wOFQxNDowNToyMlrOGCw4zQ==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwNTUwNTUyMQ==", "bodyText": "Why we need fuse for the current code?", "url": "https://github.com/apache/ozone/pull/782#discussion_r405505521", "createdAt": "2020-04-08T13:00:57Z", "author": {"login": "fapifta"}, "path": "hadoop-ozone/native-client/README.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,79 @@\n+#Overview\n+\n+libozfs is a JNI based C API for Ozone File System.
