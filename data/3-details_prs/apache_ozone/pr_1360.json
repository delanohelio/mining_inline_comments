Remove archaic reference to Skaffold", "bodyText": "What changes were proposed in this pull request?\nI got sidetracked when I ran into the README in the dist folder because it referenced Skaffold which hasn't been used in a while.\nSo that others don't get confused as I did, this PR points people to the relevant pages in the Getting Started guide.  In addition, I cleaned up some grammatical and typographical issues that I noticed.\nI feel like the 'Monitoring' and 'Notes on the Kubernetes setup' Sections could also be moved to the Getting Started guide so that documentation is more consolidated in one place, but I didn't want to move too much too soon.
