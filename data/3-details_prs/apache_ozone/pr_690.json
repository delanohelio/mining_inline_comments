Refactor SafeModeHandler to use a Notification Interface", "bodyText": "What changes were proposed in this pull request?\nThe SafeModeHandler currently accepts several objects which it notifies when the safe mode status changes.\nEach of these object are notified using a different method (there is no \"notification interface\") and some of the logic which really belongs in those objects (ie what to do when safemode goes on or off) is in the safemode classes rather than in the receiving class.\nAs we may need to extend safemode somewhat to delay pipeline creation until sufficient nodes have registered, I think it is worthwhile to refactor this area to do the following:\n\nIntroduce a new Interface \"SafeModeTransition\" which must be implemented by any object which wants to listen for safemode starting or ending.\n\npublic interface SafeModeTransition {\n  void handleSafeModeTransition(SCMSafeModeManager.SafeModeStatus status);\n}\n\n\n\nPass the SafeModeStatus object over this new interface. That way, we can extend SafeModeStatus to include more states in the future than just safemode = true / false.\n\n\nChange the constructor of SafeModeHandler to allow any number of objects to be registered to make it more flexible going forward.\n\n\nEnsure the logic of what action to take on safemode transition lives within the notified objects rather than in the Safemode clases.\n\n\nWhat is the link to the Apache JIRA\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDDS-3221\nHow was this patch tested?\nDepends on existing unit tests", "createdAt": "2020-03-16T23:21:32Z", "url": "https://github.com/apache/ozone/pull/690", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "0c1bc5654bd0025bae375f613e448130671296f6"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-03-20T15:11:24Z", "author": {"login": "sodonnel"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 6, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABcOVyuZAH2gAyMzg5NTQxNjMyOmNiNThmMjg4YWVlNmEzOTljZDI0ODFkMjYxM2I0Mjg4OTk0MDQwZTc=", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABcO9nwFgFqTM3NzIyMzgzMQ==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "cb58f288aee6a399cd2481d2613b4288994040e7", "author": {"user": null}, "url": "https://github.com/apache/ozone/commit/cb58f288aee6a399cd2481d2613b4288994040e7", "committedDate": "2020-03-16T22:24:26Z", "message": "Refactor interfaced used by SafeModeHandler to notiy objects when the safemode state changes"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "68270e3ead5fa5b26a739ac61569b6f8afa58981", "author": {"user": null}, "url": "https://github.com/apache/ozone/commit/68270e3ead5fa5b26a739ac61569b6f8afa58981", "committedDate": "2020-03-16T22:48:02Z", "message": "Change the constructor of the SafeModeHandler"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Mzc1NjYzMzg2", "url": "https://github.com/apache/ozone/pull/690#pullrequestreview-375663386", "createdAt": "2020-03-17T00:18:30Z", "commit": {"oid": "68270e3ead5fa5b26a739ac61569b6f8afa58981"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMy0xN1QwMDoxODozMFrOF3J_rw==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMy0xN1QwMDoxODozMFrOF3J_rw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5MzM3OTc1OQ==", "bodyText": "NIT: Can we rename this to as SafeModeNotification.
