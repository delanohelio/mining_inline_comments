The Host Campaign will make requests through the same mechanism.\n+4. The Host Campaign will advertise all market changes to the Remote Campaigns.\n+\n+Expansions to the existing markets will be needed to ensure sufficient diversity\n+exists to make this mode feel interesting.\n+\n+### Generating OpFor from Remote Campaigns\n+This objective is TBD on its design details.\n+\n+## Distributed MekHQ Architecture\n+Distributed MekHQ will be a standard Client-Server architecture, with one instance\n+serving as the host of the session. The underlying protocol will be gRPC and the\n+message flow will be roughly PUBSUB.\n+\n+The general message flow is as follows:\n+1. A Remote Campaign connects to a Host Campaign and sends a ConnectionRequest.\n+2. If the Host Campaign is compatible with the Remote Campaign, the Host Campaign responds with a ConnectionResponse.\n+3. If the Remote Campaign is compatible with the Host Campaign, the Remote Campaign sends a Message stream.\n+4. The Host Campaign responds with a Message stream.\n+5. Gameplay messages flow over these streams.\n+\n+Notes:\n+- If a Host Campaign cannot support the Remote Campaign version the connection is terminated.\n+- If a Remote Campaign cannot support the Host Campaign version the connection is terminated.\n+- If the Remote Campaign does not use the correct password the connection is terminated.\n+\n+### Security\n+As Distributed MekHQ uses gRPC, TLS will be made available as an option to secure the underlying transport. Further, a ConnectionRequest may include an optional password. Messages sent over the streams will use Protobuf and not support arbitrary serialization.\n+\n+### ConnectionRequest\n+The ConnectionRequest message is sent by the Remote Campaign when it first connects to the Host Campaign.\n+\n+The ConnectionRequest message has the following properties:\n+- Remote Campaign Version\n+- Remote Campaign Name\n+- Remote Campaign UUID\n+- Remote Campaign Date\n+- Password (*OPTIONAL*)\n+\n+The Host Campaign shall ignore additional ConnectRequest messages once a connection has been established for a Remote Campaign.\n+\n+### ConnectionResponse\n+The ConnectionResponse message is sent by the Host Campaign when it accepts a connection from a Remote Campaign.\n+\n+The ConnectionResponse message has the following properties:\n+- Host Campaign Version\n+- Host Campaign Name\n+- Host Campaign UUID\n+- Host Campaign Date\n+- Remote Campaign List\n+    - Remote Campaign Name\n+    - Remote Campaign UUID\n+    - Remote Campaign Date\n+    - Remote Campaign Team\n+\n+### Message Bus Messages\n+The Message Bus contains all client-to-server messages to be processed by the server and either redistributed or transformed.\n+\n+Each message is encapsulated over a bidirectional gRPC stream with the following format:\n+- Timestamp\n+- Message Type\n+- Metadata Map (String -> String)\n+- Message Bytes (protobuf)\n+\n+#### CampaignDateChanged\n+The CampaignDateChanged message notifies the Host Campaign that a Remote Campaign has advanced days.\n+\n+The CampaignDateChanged message has the following properties:\n+- Campaign UUID\n+- Campaign Date\n+\n+This message is redistributed to all connected campaigns.\n+\n+#### GMModeChanged\n+The GMModeChanged message notifies the Host Campaign that a Remote Campaign has changed their GM Mode.\n+\n+The GMModeChanged message has the following properties:\n+- Campaign UUID\n+- Is GM?\n+\n+This message is redistributed to all connected campaigns.\n+\n+#### TeamAssignment\n+The TeamAssignment message notifies a Remote Campaign of team assignments.\n+\n+The TeamAssignment message has the following properties:\n+- Team List\n+    - Remote Campaign UUID\n+    - Remote Campaign Team\n+\n+The Host Campaign is always Team 1.\n+\n+This message is only sent by the Host Campaign.\n+\n+#### DailyLog\n+The DailyLog message notifies the Host Campaign of a daily log activity.\n+\n+The DailyLog message has the following properties:\n+- Campaign UUID\n+- Log Date\n+- Log List\n+    - Log Entry\n+\n+This message may be sent at any point in a day and may be sent mulitple times, but implementations could delay sending this message until a day has completed.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "4e76b6b81af79abe54571219c76d9109041ca532"}, "originalPosition": 197}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4NzI3Mjk0MA==", "bodyText": "Why not allow multiple active trades?
