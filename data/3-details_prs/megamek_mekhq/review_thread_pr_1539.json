The underlying protocol will be gRPC and the\n+message flow will be roughly PUBSUB.\n+\n+The general message flow is as follows:\n+1. A Remote Campaign connects to a Host Campaign and sends a ConnectionRequest.\n+2. If the Host Campaign is compatible with the Remote Campaign, the Host Campaign responds with a ConnectionResponse.\n+3. If the Remote Campaign is compatible with the Host Campaign, the Remote Campaign sends a Message stream.\n+4. The Host Campaign responds with a Message stream.\n+5.

This document describes the design and architecture\n+for Distributed MekHQ.\n+\n+## Objectives and Non-Goals\n+This section describes the objectives of Distributed MekHQ and what will\n+not be part of the design.\n+\n+### Objectives\n+1. Support a common timeline between Campaigns.\n+2. Support common scenarios and contracts between Campaigns.\n+3. Support trading of parts, vehicles, and personnel between Campaigns.\n+4. Support centralized contract, unit, and personnel markets.\n+5. Support generation of OpFor from other Campaigns.\n+\n+### Non-Goals\n+1. Distributed MekHQ will not support shared Campaigns.\n+2. Distributed MekHQ will not support shared parts, vehicles, or personnel.\n+3. Distributed MekHQ will not support controlling other Campaigns.\n+4. Distributed MekHQ will not support chat.\n+\n+## Distributed MekHQ Design\n+This section details the high level design of Distributed MekHQ and serves\n+as the Use-Case basis for the architecture.\n+\n+### Concepts\n+- **Host Campaign**: the Campaign which launched the distributed MekHQ session.\n+- **Remote Campaign**: any Campaign not running as part of the local MekHQ client.\n+- **Timeline**: the latest date among the connected Campaigns.\n+- **Teams**: connected Campaigns which cannot be generated as OpFor in a contract.\n+- **Trading**: a mechanism by which connected Campaigns can exchange parts, units,\n+personnel, and money in exchange for any combination of the same.\n+\n+### Common Timeline\n+The fundamental feature of Distributed MekHQ is a common timeline shared among\n+the connected campaigns. Ultimately, each campaign will be managed and operated\n+independently, EXCEPT for advancing time. This is accomplished through one simple\n+invariant:\n+> No campaign may be further along in time than the Host campaign.\n+\n+This invariant is held through the following means:\n+1. Only the Host Campaign may advance the day without restrictions.\n+2. Remote Campaigns may advance the day without contacting the Host Campaign if\n+   they are at least one day behind the Host Campaign.\n+3. Remote Campaigns may inform the Host Campaign they are ready to advance\n+   the day, but their local campaign will not advance until their client has\n+   been informed that the Host Campaign has moved beyond their local date.\n+\n+#### Corner Cases\n+1. A Remote Campaign connects and is AHEAD of the Host Campaign.\n+    a. The Remote Campaign SHALL NOT advance time until the Host Campaign\n+       has moved beyond their local date.\n+2. A Remote Campaign connects and is markedly behind the Host Campaign.\n+    a. The Remote Campaign MAY advance time in bulk, but not past the\n+       Host Campaign.\n+    b. The Remote Campaign MAY be given the option to \"Jump\" to the Host\n+       Campaign's timeline, skipping all the usual checks. This should\n+       only be an option in GM Mode.\n+3. The Host Campaign disconnects.\n+    a. The Remote Campaign will be given the option to continue playing\n+       without a Host Campaign. If the timelines diverge before they\n+       reconnect, the invariants will be held through the aforementioned\n+       means.\n+\n+### Common Scenarios and Contracts\n+This objective is TBD on its design details.\n+\n+### Trading\n+If you give a mouse a cookie, it is said that they will want a glass of milk.\n+Trading is the natural extension to Distributed MekHQ.\n+\n+Initial support will be limited to the following actions:\n+- Same-day wiring of funds.\n+- JumpPath distance + 1 day shipping of parts for a fee.\n+- JumpPath distance + 1 day shipping of STOCK units for a fee.\n+- JumpPath distance + 1 day transit of personnel for a fee.\n+\n+Subsequent support will be added for the following actions:\n+- JumpPath distance + 1 day shipping of CUSTOM units for a fee.\n+\n+Support may be considered for the following actions:\n+- Usage of company JumpShips and DropShips to transport traded items.\n+\n+### Centralized Markets\n+Once Campaigns are connected they should operate under the same markets.\n+First-come, first-serve will be used, along with diversifying the selections\n+by having per-area markets. This will be accomplished by one simple invariant:\n+> The Host Campaign will be the arbiter of all sales and hires.\n+\n+This invariant is held through the following means:\n+1. All purchase or hiring will be made as requests through the Host Campaign.\n+2. All purchase or hiring requests will be timestamped.\n+3. The Host Campaign will make requests through the same mechanism.\n+4. The Host Campaign will advertise all market changes to the Remote Campaigns.\n+\n+Expansions to the existing markets will be needed to ensure sufficient diversity\n+exists to make this mode feel interesting.\n+\n+### Generating OpFor from Remote Campaigns\n+This objective is TBD on its design details.\n+\n+## Distributed MekHQ Architecture\n+Distributed MekHQ will be a standard Client-Server architecture, with one instance\n+serving as the host of the session. The underlying protocol will be gRPC and the\n+message flow will be roughly PUBSUB.\n+\n+The general message flow is as follows:\n+1. A Remote Campaign connects to a Host Campaign and sends a ConnectionRequest.\n+2. If the Host Campaign is compatible with the Remote Campaign, the Host Campaign responds with a ConnectionResponse.\n+3. If the Remote Campaign is compatible with the Host Campaign, the Remote Campaign sends a Message stream.\n+4. The Host Campaign responds with a Message stream.\n+5.

Ultimately, each campaign will be managed and operated\n+independently, EXCEPT for advancing time. This is accomplished through one simple\n+invariant:\n+> No campaign may be further along in time than the Host campaign.\n+\n+This invariant is held through the following means:\n+1. Only the Host Campaign may advance the day without restrictions.\n+2. Remote Campaigns may advance the day without contacting the Host Campaign if\n+   they are at least one day behind the Host Campaign.\n+3.

The Host Campaign disconnects.\n+    a. The Remote Campaign will be given the option to continue playing\n+       without a Host Campaign. If the timelines diverge before they\n+       reconnect, the invariants will be held through the aforementioned\n+       means.\n+\n+### Common Scenarios and Contracts\n+This objective is TBD on its design details.\n+\n+### Trading\n+If you give a mouse a cookie, it is said that they will want a glass of milk.\n+Trading is the natural extension to Distributed MekHQ.\n+\n+Initial support will be limited to the following actions:\n+- Same-day wiring of funds.\n+- JumpPath distance + 1 day shipping of parts for a fee.\n+- JumpPath distance + 1 day shipping of STOCK units for a fee.\n+- JumpPath distance + 1 day transit of personnel for a fee.\n+\n+Subsequent support will be added for the following actions:\n+- JumpPath distance + 1 day shipping of CUSTOM units for a fee.\n+\n+Support may be considered for the following actions:\n+- Usage of company JumpShips and DropShips to transport traded items.\n+\n+### Centralized Markets\n+Once Campaigns are connected they should operate under the same markets.\n+First-come, first-serve will be used, along with diversifying the selections\n+by having per-area markets. This will be accomplished by one simple invariant:\n+> The Host Campaign will be the arbiter of all sales and hires.\n+\n+This invariant is held through the following means:\n+1. All purchase or hiring will be made as requests through the Host Campaign.\n+2. All purchase or hiring requests will be timestamped.\n+3. The Host Campaign will make requests through the same mechanism.\n+4.

The underlying protocol will be gRPC and the\n+message flow will be roughly PUBSUB.\n+\n+The general message flow is as follows:\n+1. A Remote Campaign connects to a Host Campaign and sends a ConnectionRequest.\n+2. If the Host Campaign is compatible with the Remote Campaign, the Host Campaign responds with a ConnectionResponse.\n+3. If the Remote Campaign is compatible with the Host Campaign, the Remote Campaign sends a Message stream.\n+4. The Host Campaign responds with a Message stream.\n+5. Gameplay messages flow over these streams.\n+\n+Notes:\n+- If a Host Campaign cannot support the Remote Campaign version the connection is terminated.\n+- If a Remote Campaign cannot support the Host Campaign version the connection is terminated.\n+- If the Remote Campaign does not use the correct password the connection is terminated.\n+\n+### Security\n+As Distributed MekHQ uses gRPC, TLS will be made available as an option to secure the underlying transport. Further, a ConnectionRequest may include an optional password. Messages sent over the streams will use Protobuf and not support arbitrary serialization.\n+\n+### ConnectionRequest\n+The ConnectionRequest message is sent by the Remote Campaign when it first connects to the Host Campaign.\n+\n+The ConnectionRequest message has the following properties:\n+- Remote Campaign Version\n+- Remote Campaign Name\n+- Remote Campaign UUID\n+- Remote Campaign Date\n+- Password (*OPTIONAL*)\n+\n+The Host Campaign shall ignore additional ConnectRequest messages once a connection has been established for a Remote Campaign.\n+\n+### ConnectionResponse\n+The ConnectionResponse message is sent by the Host Campaign when it accepts a connection from a Remote Campaign.\n+\n+The ConnectionResponse message has the following properties:\n+- Host Campaign Version\n+- Host Campaign Name\n+- Host Campaign UUID\n+- Host Campaign Date\n+- Remote Campaign List\n+    -
