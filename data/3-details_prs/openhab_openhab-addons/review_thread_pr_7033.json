And the log file showed warnings \"Channel ... not supported!\".\nWhat I found was that for a MQTT Homeassistant light, after it is discovered a Color item is created in Open HAB and a channel is created between the Color item and the Light Thing.  Then if I change any of the properties of the Color item in the OpenHAB Paper UI (color, brightness etc.) This method is called from line 125 of AbstractMQTTThingHandler in mqtt.generic:\n@Override\npublic void handleCommand(ChannelUID channelUID, Command command) {\n    if (connection == null) {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    final @Nullable ChannelState data = getChannelState(channelUID);\n\n    if (data == null) {\n        logger.warn(\"Channel {} not supported!\", channelUID);\n        return;\n    }\n\nDebugging shows that the result from getChannelState was null, and the channel UID passed in ends with \"#color\".\ngetChannelState is implemented here at line 223 of HomeAssistantThingHander.java\n@SuppressWarnings({ \"null\", \"unused\" })\n@Override\npublic @Nullable ChannelState getChannelState(ChannelUID channelUID) {\n    String groupID = channelUID.getGroupId();\n    if (groupID == null) {\n        return null;\n    }\n    AbstractComponent<?> component;\n    synchronized (haComponents) { // sync whenever discoverComponents is started\n        component = haComponents.get(groupID);\n    }\n    if (component == null) {\n        return null;\n    }\n    CChannel componentChannel = component.channel(channelUID.getIdWithoutGroup());\n    if (componentChannel == null) {\n        return null;\n    }\n\nThe component.channel function is implemented at line 185 in AbstractComponent.java\npublic @Nullable CChannel channel(String channelID) {\n    return channels.get(channelID);\n}\n\nFurther debugging shows that channelUID.getIdWithoutGroup() returns \"color\" and channels.get returns null without my changes, the debugger showed that the channels tree contained only one item labeled \"light\".  So a lookup with the name \"color\" failed.  With my change, registering the \"color\" UID in channels.put, the lookup succeeds and the changes made in the Color Item propagate through properly to the MQTT broker.
