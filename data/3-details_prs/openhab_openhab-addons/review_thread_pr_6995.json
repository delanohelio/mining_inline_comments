I don't really know for which use case it was added, so I'm not sure what would be a better implementation. I think Bluez has no such thing (because Bluez discovery also works for devices that don't send a scan response).\nMore detailed thoughts on this:\nIf you have an idea how to follow the original intention of these checks while getting devices that don't send a scan response discovered as well, I'm open to it. Unfortunately, I only have \"fire&forget\" BLE devices who all do not send a scan response.\nI'm not saying it's the best option to remove it, but for now afaik we have not a single binding that makes use of scan response data, all of them check discovery upon manufacturerId or (short) device name which is based on advertisement, not on scan response. Anyhow, we have a binding in the pipe which does not send scan responses and does not work with this check.\nSo by removing it, everything that currently exists will still work, and bindings in the pipe which don't send a scan response will additionally work.\nI'm not sure if there will be a big need to have the scan response before discovery in the near future, but if yes, it'll probably be more a convienience functionality than something which is required for the discovery to properly work. If there is such use case, I think this can still be (re-)implemented in a better way so it'll work for all devices.\nPersonally, I don't want to come up with an ideal implementation without having a possibility to test this implementation properly with a real device using it. So for now, I'd like to continue with this unpretentious implementation which works better than the current one for all existing and upcoming bindings.\nWe can also put it in comments so that future people who need a scan response can build up on the past (not working) code base and this discussion.", "url": "https://github.com/openhab/openhab-addons/pull/6995#discussion_r377401237", "createdAt": "2020-02-11T00:48:01Z", "author": {"login": "pfink"}, "path": "bundles/org.openhab.binding.bluetooth.bluegiga/src/main/java/org/openhab/binding/bluetooth/bluegiga/BlueGigaBluetoothDevice.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -229,27 +248,18 @@ public void bluegigaEventReceived(BlueGigaResponse event) {\n             }\n \n             if (connectionState == ConnectionState.DISCOVERING) {\n-                // We want to wait for an advertisement and a scan response before we call this discovered.\n-                // The intention is to gather a reasonable amount of data about the device given devices send\n-                // different data in different packets...\n-                // Note that this is possible a bit arbitrary and may be refined later.\n                 scanResponses.add(scanEvent.getPacketType());\n \n-                if ((scanResponses.contains(ScanResponseType.CONNECTABLE_ADVERTISEMENT)\n-                        || scanResponses.contains(ScanResponseType.DISCOVERABLE_ADVERTISEMENT)\n-                        || scanResponses.contains(ScanResponseType.NON_CONNECTABLE_ADVERTISEMENT))\n-                        && scanResponses.contains(ScanResponseType.SCAN_RESPONSE)) {", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3NzM4NDAxNQ=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "0ae2e118a61fd6de37d9a860fa62ae77037ccd37"}, "originalPosition": 54}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3NzQwOTM0OA==", "bodyText": "Well you convinced me.
