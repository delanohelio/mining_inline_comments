Your aim is to keep the documentation as compact as possible.

That's why I thought it makes sense to provide that information right there where people are looking for it.\nI realize that your point may also be that users should read the general tutorial before reading the documentation, and for those users who learn a new system in abstract terms before applying that knowledge in practice, that will work fine. But I think there are many users who find it easier to understand how a new system works by trying out how specific things work and building a more abstract picture from that. So to accommodate those users, I would think it makes sense for the documentation to also support that learning path.
