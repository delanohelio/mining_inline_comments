I don't think that simply checking if it is open at this point is sufficient to prevent ClosedSelectorException from getting thrown.\nI think the easiest way to deal with this error is to just catch the ClosedSelectorException.\nBut a more proper way to prevent this error from getting thrown is to make the transceiverThread responsible for opening and closing the selector and to add logic to allow outside threads to instruct the transceiverThread to close the selector on its own accord.\nI'm ok with either solution but I think the first one is better because there are fewer things that can go wrong with it.", "url": "https://github.com/openhab/openhab-addons/pull/7776#discussion_r429692775", "createdAt": "2020-05-25T00:41:08Z", "author": {"login": "cpmeister"}, "path": "bundles/org.openhab.binding.keba/src/main/java/org/openhab/binding/keba/internal/handler/KeContactTransceiver.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -219,6 +219,9 @@ protected ByteBuffer send(String message, KeContactHandler handler) {\n         while (true) {\n             try {\n                 synchronized (selector) {\n+                    if (!selector.isOpen()) {\n+                        return;\n+                    }", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "0ff2a17f4a8cd3c9d4bf190875718e821fb80c6e"}, "originalPosition": 6}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzMDAzOTI5MQ==", "bodyText": "Thanks @cpmeister, this makes a lot of sense indeed.
