I could rename the variable if that is clearer for you.\n\nIt also seems like you are using the watchdog for multiple purposes, both as an update timeout and to track the time between updates.

It might be better to implement your watchdog as a ScheduledFuture instead.\n\nThere are good reasons why I implemented that way\n\nI want 1 central point of dealing with device timeouts - that's refreshStatus()\nThe device \"has a last chance\" to respond, this has a higher priority than setting it to OFFLINE, because of a timeout\nI don't want to have another periodic task to be synchronized - the watchdog affects the thing, that needs to be in sync\nThe watchdog is important to detect dead devices, but not critical, therefore it's ok it the condition gets processed somewhat later\n\nEven when thinking about it I still like the implementation. It's not invasive, users have confirmed that it works fine.
