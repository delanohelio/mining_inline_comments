Onl\u2026", "bodyText": "\u2026y one FHIR context per specification is permitted in native mode\ncc @lburgazzoli addresses #654\nI've changed the way HAPI FHIR integrates with Quarkus. The approach used here is similar to what camel-quarkus-core does.\nInstead of enabling reflection everywhere, I've opted to record the FHIR context (for each specification). Therefore only one context per specification can be used in native mode. This limitation is in line with what is recommended.\nThanks !", "createdAt": "2020-02-03T15:14:23Z", "url": "https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/pull/678", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "29ca6b08b611452ceb0ba11ce8797127d51cb385"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-02-04T12:11:06Z", "author": {"login": "johnpoth"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 6, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABcAunxAgFqTM1MjMzNjY4Nw==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABcC6cY7AFqTM1NTgxOTEwMA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3MzUyMzM2Njg3", "url": "https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/pull/678#pullrequestreview-352336687", "createdAt": "2020-02-03T15:25:09Z", "commit": {"oid": "c932f2a598030b3a4f052214e986893604b9d358"}, "state": "CHANGES_REQUESTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 0, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": null, "endCursor": null, "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": []}}, {"__typename": "HeadRefForcePushedEvent", "beforeCommit": {"oid": "c932f2a598030b3a4f052214e986893604b9d358", "author": {"user": {"login": "johnpoth", "name": "John Poth"}}, "url": "https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/commit/c932f2a598030b3a4f052214e986893604b9d358", "committedDate": "2020-01-31T17:15:55Z", "message": "camel-fhir record FHIR context instead of creating it at runtime.
