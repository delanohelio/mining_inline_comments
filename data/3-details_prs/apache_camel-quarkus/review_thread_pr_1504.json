Grok default patterns includes things like mac, ip, number and so on.\nThat said, patterns/patterns may be a bit vague but is not under our control. The test coverage must be correct as we are using mac, ip and so on in itests. Concerning the doc, I would let it in camel, maybe just clarify the predefined patterns section.\nWDYT ?", "url": "https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/pull/1504#discussion_r462281843", "createdAt": "2020-07-29T13:05:26Z", "author": {"login": "aldettinger"}, "path": "extensions/grok/deployment/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/quarkus/component/grok/deployment/GrokProcessor.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,36 @@\n+/*\n+ * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more\n+ * contributor license agreements.
