One issue should ideally be fixed by not more than one commit and the other way round, each commit should fix just one issue, without pulling in other changes.\n[ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful and properly spelled subject line and body. Copying the title of the associated issue is typically enough. Please include the issue number in the commit message prefixed by #.\n[ ] The pull request description should explain what the pull request does, how, and why. If the info is available in the associated issue or some other external document, a link is enough.\n[ ] Phrases like Fix # or Fixes # will auto-close the named issue upon merging the pull request. Using them is typically a good idea.\n[ ] Please run mvn process-resources -Pformat (and amend the changes if necessary) before sending the pull request.\n[ ] Contributor guide is your good friend: https://camel.apache.org/camel-quarkus/latest/contributor-guide.html", "createdAt": "2020-07-03T11:25:38Z", "url": "https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/pull/1452", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "1e6a3666d9859b1028add13ffdd2919747c57785"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-07-07T06:21:34Z", "author": {"login": "JiriOndrusek"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 5, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABcxRt7BgFqTQ0MjM0ODE4Nw==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABcyfvrnAFqTQ0MzU5MTgyNQ==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDQyMzQ4MTg3", "url": "https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/pull/1452#pullrequestreview-442348187", "createdAt": "2020-07-03T11:26:55Z", "commit": {"oid": "c72be838098ad519240e11be5aa8d00d64010757"}, "state": "APPROVED", "comments": {"totalCount": 0, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": null, "endCursor": null, "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": []}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDQyMzc0NTc0", "url": "https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/pull/1452#pullrequestreview-442374574", "createdAt": "2020-07-03T12:19:14Z", "commit": {"oid": "c72be838098ad519240e11be5aa8d00d64010757"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 4, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNy0wM1QxMjoxOToxNFrOGsumpg==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNy0wM1QxMjoyNToyN1rOGsuwOw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0OTU1NDA4Ng==", "bodyText": "Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n            To use camel-mock capabilities it is required to get access to MockEndpoint instances.\n          \n          \n            \n            To use camel-mock capabilities in tests it is required to get access to MockEndpoint instances.", "url": "https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/pull/1452#discussion_r449554086", "createdAt": "2020-07-03T12:19:14Z", "author": {"login": "ppalaga"}, "path": "docs/modules/ROOT/pages/extensions/mock.adoc", "diffHunk": "@@ -26,3 +26,37 @@ Please refer to the above link for usage and configuration details.\n ----\n \n Check the xref:user-guide/index.adoc[User guide] for more information about writing Camel Quarkus applications.\n+\n+== Usage\n+\n+To use camel-mock capabilities it is required to get access to MockEndpoint instances.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "c72be838098ad519240e11be5aa8d00d64010757"}, "originalPosition": 7}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0OTU1NDY1Ng==", "bodyText": "Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n            @Inject\n          \n          \n            \n            \n          \n          \n            \n            @QuarkusTest\n          \n          \n            \n            class MyTest {\n          \n          \n            \n            \n          \n          \n            \n            @Inject\n          \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\nplus I vote for naming all or at least the most important imports.", "url": "https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/pull/1452#discussion_r449554656", "createdAt": "2020-07-03T12:20:37Z", "author": {"login": "ppalaga"}, "path": "docs/modules/ROOT/pages/extensions/mock.adoc", "diffHunk": "@@ -26,3 +26,37 @@ Please refer to the above link for usage and configuration details.\n ----\n \n Check the xref:user-guide/index.adoc[User guide] for more information about writing Camel Quarkus applications.\n+\n+== Usage\n+\n+To use camel-mock capabilities it is required to get access to MockEndpoint instances.\n+\n+CDI injection could be used for accessing instances (see https://quarkus.io/guides/getting-started-testing#injection-into-tests[Quarkus documentation]).\n+You can inject camelContext into test using `@Inject` annotation.
