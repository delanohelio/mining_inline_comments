One issue should ideally be fixed by not more than one commit and the other way round, each commit should fix just one issue, without pulling in other changes.\n[ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful and properly spelled subject line and body. Copying the title of the associated issue is typically enough. Please include the issue number in the commit message prefixed by #.\n[ ] The pull request description should explain what the pull request does, how, and why. If the info is available in the associated issue or some other external document, a link is enough.\n[ ] Phrases like Fix # or Fixes # will auto-close the named issue upon merging the pull request. Using them is typically a good idea.\n[ ] Please run mvn process-resources -Pformat (and amend the changes if necessary) before sending the pull request.\n[ ] Contributor guide is your good friend: https://camel.apache.org/camel-quarkus/latest/contributor-guide.html", "createdAt": "2020-07-06T02:02:45Z", "url": "https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/pull/1457", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "d57f186c712a1edd944bdfb2325f4e9b6f8b1d87"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-07-06T08:49:42Z", "author": {"login": "zhfeng"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 4, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABcyHb8OgH2gAyNDQ0NDk4Nzg4Ojg2ZGJiMjQxYjhlMWZhMTk2YzBlNDQwZTY5NjI3MjdkNmU4ODUwZDk=", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABcyNI3sgH2gAyNDQ0NDk4Nzg4OjRhMmVjZGQxNmNkOGY1MjI3NDk3ODYwOTI0ODdhMmM5MGUwNjNjYjc=", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "86dbb241b8e1fa196c0e440e6962727d6e8850d9", "author": {"user": {"login": "zhfeng", "name": "Amos Feng"}}, "url": "https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/commit/86dbb241b8e1fa196c0e440e6962727d6e8850d9", "committedDate": "2020-07-06T02:02:09Z", "message": "Fix #1428 to add the usage.adoc"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDQyODEzMDAz", "url": "https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/pull/1457#pullrequestreview-442813003", "createdAt": "2020-07-06T06:50:59Z", "commit": {"oid": "86dbb241b8e1fa196c0e440e6962727d6e8850d9"}, "state": "APPROVED", "comments": {"totalCount": 0, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": null, "endCursor": null, "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": []}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDQyODc0NDM2", "url": "https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/pull/1457#pullrequestreview-442874436", "createdAt": "2020-07-06T08:30:06Z", "commit": {"oid": "86dbb241b8e1fa196c0e440e6962727d6e8850d9"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNy0wNlQwODozMDowNlrOGtNxkw==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNy0wNlQwODozMDowNlrOGtNxkw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ1MDA2NDc4Nw==", "bodyText": "Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n            This extension could be used when you need the `transacted()` in the router.
