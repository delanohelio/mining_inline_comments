One issue should ideally be fixed by not more than one commit and the other way round, each commit should fix just one issue, without pulling in other changes.\n[ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful and properly spelled subject line and body. Copying the title of the associated issue is typically enough. Please include the issue number in the commit message prefixed by #.\n[ ] The pull request description should explain what the pull request does, how, and why. If the info is available in the associated issue or some other external document, a link is enough.\n[ ] Phrases like Fix # or Fixes # will auto-close the named issue upon merging the pull request. Using them is typically a good idea.\n[ ] Please run mvn process-resources -Pformat (and amend the changes if necessary) before sending the pull request.\n[ ] Contributor guide is your good friend: https://camel.apache.org/camel-quarkus/latest/contributor-guide.html", "createdAt": "2020-12-23T11:01:27Z", "url": "https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/pull/2093", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "b1812d939bda05650d6a2fbcb5fa2e4cd0473e01"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-12-23T18:45:51Z", "author": {"login": "zbendhiba"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 4, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABdo_tfngFqTU1Nzg4MzEyOQ==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABdpAH8-gBqjQxNDQ0MzA5ODA=", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NTU3ODgzMTI5", "url": "https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/pull/2093#pullrequestreview-557883129", "createdAt": "2020-12-23T13:57:22Z", "commit": {"oid": "58b01b2218f9e5321d892ba25c417b41d686f025"}, "state": "APPROVED", "comments": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMi0yM1QxMzo1NzoyMlrOIKlf4w==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMi0yM1QxNDowMTo1MVrOIKlnHA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0Nzk3MTA0Mw==", "bodyText": "Is this comment needed?", "url": "https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/pull/2093#discussion_r547971043", "createdAt": "2020-12-23T13:57:22Z", "author": {"login": "ppalaga"}, "path": "extensions/hazelcast/runtime/pom.xml", "diffHunk": "@@ -55,6 +63,20 @@\n             <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>\n             <artifactId>camel-hazelcast</artifactId>\n         </dependency>\n+        <dependency>\n+            <groupId>com.hazelcast</groupId>\n+            <artifactId>quarkus-hazelcast-client</artifactId>\n+        </dependency>\n+        <!-- fix version -->", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "58b01b2218f9e5321d892ba25c417b41d686f025"}, "originalPosition": 30}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0Nzk3Mjg5Mg==", "bodyText": "configureHazelcastComponent would perhaps better describe what this method does.", "url": "https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/pull/2093#discussion_r547972892", "createdAt": "2020-12-23T14:01:51Z", "author": {"login": "ppalaga"}, "path": "integration-tests/hazelcast/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/quarkus/component/hazelcast/it/HazelcastRoutes.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,189 @@\n+/*\n+ * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more\n+ * contributor license agreements.
