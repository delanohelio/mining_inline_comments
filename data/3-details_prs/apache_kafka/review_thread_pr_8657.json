Its advantage though was a simpler and more intuitive API than what we have here. An idea which I never implemented was to let the request handlers also handle delayed operation completion so that we did not need another thread pool. Basically rather than calling the callback in DelayedProduce directly, we add a new operation to the request queues. Obviously this has its own tradeoffs.\nThe second commit tries to use lock-free data structures so that we do not need the lock when completing the callback. This was only a partial solution which handled offset commit appends, but not group metadata appends. I am not sure how to handle join group completion asynchronously, so I gave up on this idea.\nOnly posting in case it's useful to see how some of these alternatives might have looked. I'm ok with the approach here, but I do wish we could come up with a simpler API. One thought I had is whether we could make the need for external completion more explicit.

TestReplicManager always create delayedProduce do handle the putCacheCallback (https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/core/src/test/scala/unit/kafka/coordinator/AbstractCoordinatorConcurrencyTest.scala#L188). The condition to complete the delayedProduce is completeAttempts.incrementAndGet() >= 3. And the condition gets true when call both producePurgatory.tryCompleteElseWatch(delayedProduce, producerRequestKeys) and tryCompleteDelayedRequests() since the former calls tryComplete two times and another calls tryComplete once. It means putCacheCallback is always executed by TestReplicManager.appendRecords and noted that TestReplicManager.appendRecords is executed within a group lock (https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/core/src/main/scala/kafka/coordinator/group/GroupCoordinator.scala#L738) . In short, txn initialization (https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/core/src/main/scala/kafka/coordinator/group/GroupMetadataManager.scala#L464) and txn append (https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/core/src/main/scala/kafka/coordinator/group/GroupMetadataManager.scala#L407) are executed with same group lock. Hence, the following execution order is impossible.\n\ntxn initialization\ntxn completion\ntxn append\n\nHowever, this PR disable to complete delayed requests within group lock held by caller.
