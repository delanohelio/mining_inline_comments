From mathematical point of view, we can consider consumer to be a function that maps its domain to the empty set. This explains our decision why consumer 'swallows' branch unlike function that 'forwards' its result to the resulting map. Then we agreed that the case when nothing is provided, like in this example\nBranchedKStream<Integer, String> branch = source.split()\n          .branch(isEven)\n          .branch(isMultipleOfSeven);\nis to be interpreted like\nBranchedKStream<Integer, String> branch = source.split()\n         .branch(isEven, Branched.withFunction(Function.identity()))\n         .branch(isMultipleOfSeven, Branched.withFunction(Function.identity()));\nNow back to Java: in Java, for nothing we have null. My original intention was to try to emulate Function|Consumer union type using overloading, but Java didn't allow me to do this dirty trick -- and separate withFunction and withConsumer builder methods appeared \ud83d\ude04\nIf I had succeded, it would have made sence to treat null uniformely for both functions and consumers.\nHope this explains why I allowed nulls and always treated it as an identity function.\nBut now I think you're right. It's best to just prohibit passing in nulls and throw explicit NPEs for both functions and consumers. This, at least, can spare us from further debates :-)", "url": "https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/9107#discussion_r548515181", "createdAt": "2020-12-24T12:24:53Z", "author": {"login": "inponomarev"}, "path": "streams/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/streams/kstream/Branched.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,150 @@\n+/*\r\n+ * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more\r\n+ * contributor license agreements.
