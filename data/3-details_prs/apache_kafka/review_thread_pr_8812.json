Any writes that end up seeing the NOT_ENOUGH_REPLICAS_AFTER_APPEND error code are more vulnerable. These are unacknowledged writes, and the producer is expected to retry, but the consumer can still read them once the ISR shrinks and we would still view it as \"data loss\" if the broker failed before they could be flushed to disk. With the \"strict min isr\" proposal, the leader is not allowed to shrink the ISR lower than some replication factor, which helps to plug this hole.\nGoing back to @purplefox's suggestion, it does seem like a good idea to flush segments beyond the recovery point during recovery. It kind of serves to constrain the initial state of the system which makes it easier to reason about (e.g. you only need to worry about the loss of unflushed data from the last restart).
