This overload of the ifacmp* bytecodes is\nrequired because valueTypes subclass java.lang.Object and use a*\nbytecodes. It is possible for the static type of a valueType to be a\nreference type (see example below) but the reflexive properties of the\n== must still be maintained.\nObject p = (Object) Point.makePoint(1, 2);\nif (p == p) //must be true\n\nThe original acmp (legacy acmp) operation in the ifacmp* bytecodes\nperforms a simple ref comparison, lhs == rhs. This must be updated to\ncheck if both operands are valueTypes, and  if they are of the same\ntype. If that is the case a structural comparison must be performed.\nExample below:\nacmpSub(lhs, rhs) {\n        if (lhs == rhs) return true\n        if ((lhs == NULL) || (rhs == NULL)) return false\n        if ((lhs.class == rhs.class) && (lhs.isValue)) return\nisSubstitutable(lhs, rhs)\n        return false\n}\n\nThe structural comparison must iterate through each field and perform an\nequality comparison. If the field is byte, short, char, int the\ncomparison in icmp_eq is performed. If the field is a long the\ncomparison in lcmp is performed. If the field is a float an icmp\ncomparison of Float.floatToIntBits of both values is performed. If the\nfield is a double an lcmp comparison of Double.doubleToLongBits of both\nvalues is performed. Note: this behaviour differs from the float f = ...; f == f case which performs a fcmp* operation (See Float.equals() in https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/lang/Float.html#equals-java.lang.Object-). If the field is a\nreference type that is java.lang.Object or an Interface or any type that\nmay contain a valueType (i.e InlineObject, Object, restricted-abstract\nclasses or interfaces) or if the field is a value type and both values\nare not NULL a recursive acmpSub is performed. For all other types the\nlegacy acmp is performed. Example is below:\nisSubstitutable(lhs, rhs) {\n        for each primitive perform primitive comparison (icmp, lcmp,\nFloat.floatToIntBits then icmp, )\n        for each ref that is j.l.Object, interface, a valueType and\nboth operands are not NULL perform acmSub (recursive)\n        for all other refs perform legacy acmp\n        return result\n}\n\nThere are cases where the JVM may optimize the individual field\ncomparisons of the substitutability test and simply perform a memcmp\nover the range of the operands. This optimization is possible in cases\nwhere the substitutability test will not require recursion and there are\nno floating point types.\nThe acmpSub will check to see if the fast comparison flag exists, if so\nit will perform a memcmp with both operands that does something like\nmemcmp(lhs, rhs, lhs.size).\nThis is based on Adithya's work in\n#8133\nSigned-off-by: Tobi Ajila atobia@ca.ibm.com", "createdAt": "2020-04-02T21:56:00Z", "url": "https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/pull/9101", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "fe71875cbb0c85fbef5d96beb02f157172f99fde"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-04-08T19:54:19Z", "author": {"login": "tajila"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 53, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABcTzwYlgBqjMxOTQwOTE2MzQ=", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABcVrJCigFqTM5MDE3Mjc1Mw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "HeadRefForcePushedEvent", "beforeCommit": {"oid": "ddbc3e3e51f42c7db23be0bac0b3bef0c1691e91", "author": {"user": {"login": "XxAdi101xX", "name": "Adithya Venkatarao"}}, "url": "https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/commit/ddbc3e3e51f42c7db23be0bac0b3bef0c1691e91", "committedDate": "2020-04-02T20:22:11Z", "message": "ACMP compatibility for value types\n\nThis commit adds the implementation to handle value types when the ACMP\nbytecode is used to compare object fields.

This must be updated to\ncheck if both operands are valueTypes, and\u00a0 if they are of the same\ntype. If that is the case a structural comparison must be performed.\nExample below:\n\n```\nacmpSub(lhs, rhs) {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 if (lhs == rhs) return true\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 if ((lhs == NULL) || (rhs == NULL)) return false\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 if ((lhs.class == rhs.class) && (lhs.isValue)) return\nisSubstitutable(lhs, rhs)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 return false\n}\n```\n\nThe structural comparison must iterate through each field and perform an\nequality comparison. If the field is byte, short, char, int the\ncomparison in icmp_eq is performed. If the field is a long the\ncomparison in lcmp is performed. If the field is a float an icmp\ncomparison of Float.floatToIntBits of both values is performed. If the\nfield is a double an lcmp comparison of Double.doubleToLongBits of both\nvalues is performed. Note: this behaviour differs from the float f =\n...; f == f case which performs a fcmp* operation. If the field is a\nreference type that is java.lang.Object or an Interface or any type that\nmay contain a valueType (i.e InlineObject, Object, restricted-abstract\nclasses or interfaces) or if the field is a value type and both values\nare not NULL a recursive acmpSub is performed. For all other types the\nlegacy acmp is performed. Example is below:\n\n```\nisSubstitutable(lhs, rhs) {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 for each primitive perform primitive comparison (icmp, lcmp,\nFloat.floatToIntBits then icmp, )\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 for each ref that is j.l.Object, interface, a valueType and\nboth operands are not NULL perform acmSub (recursive)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 for all other refs perform legacy acmp\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 return result\n}\n```\n\nThere are cases where the JVM may optimize the individual field\ncomparisons of the substitutability test and simply perform a memcmp\nover the range of the operands. This optimization is possible in cases\nwhere the substitutability test will not require recursion and there are\nno floating point types.\nThe acmpSub will check to see if the fast comparison flag exists, if so\nit will perform a memcmp with both operands that does something like\nmemcmp(lhs, rhs, lhs.size).\n\nThis is based on Adithya's work in\nhttps://github.com/eclipse/openj9/pull/8133\n\nSigned-off-by: Tobi Ajila <atobia@ca.ibm.com>"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3MzkwMTcyNzUz", "url": "https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/pull/9101#pullrequestreview-390172753", "createdAt": "2020-04-08T17:14:17Z", "commit": {"oid": "5705b0964a1bc3ba5b5c7c7e94d795afa2a7ab21"}, "state": "APPROVED", "comments": {"totalCount": 0, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": null, "endCursor": null, "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": []}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 1171, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-10-28T17:48:14Z"}}}
