with instance description bits with respect to\nflattened types. See #10070.\n\nCurrently, there is a mistach between the layout of a type on its own,\nand when it is flattened. This is due to the pre-padding required for\nstandalone valuetypes on compressedrefs and 32bit mode. The backfill has\nbeen\nused to track pre-padding. This is an error prone approach and has cause\nbugs in the past.\n\nThe only cases where pre-padding is needed is on compressedRefs where\nthere is at least one double-slot sized field. A better solution (to\nbackfill approach) is, instead of pre-padding, insert a single slot\nfield in the spot where the padding would be. This this means that if a\ntype (in compressedrefs/32bit mode) has at least one single slot or ref\nfield\nthe pre-padding is not needed. This leaves fields with only double slot\nfields. In these cases, we do not need to track the padding because\ndouble-slot fields cannot be references, so there is no mismatch with\nthe instance description bits between the standalone layout and the\nflattened layout.\n\nInstead of using backfill this PR proposes an approach that makes\npre-padding explicit ie `J9CLASS_HAS_4BYTE_PREPADDING`. When a type is\nflattened the pre-padding is eliminated, so offsets into flattened types\nneed to take this into account.\n\nThe backfill logic has been updated. The new back fill ordering is:\n1. instance singles\n2. instance objects\n3. flat end-aligned singles\n4. flat end-aligned objects\n5. flat end-unaligned singles\n6. flat end-unaligned objects\n7. hidden singles\n8. hidden objects\n\nThis ordering only applies to valuetypes, in the future this may be\nextended to reference types as well.\n\nIf a flattenable type requires double alignment in the past the type\nwill be pre-padded.
