The waiting on the monitor has a timeout to\navoid scenarios where a sequenceNumber is completely lost. In that situation,\nthe JITServer must clear its cache because some important updates may be missing.\nStarting with a clear CHTable cache, the JITServer will ask the client for the\nentire CHTable, after which the incremental CHTable updates mechanism may start\nagain.\n\nThe mechanism described above is already implemented, but has a shortcoming:\nthe incoming requests are processed strictly in the order dictated by the client\neven though they may not cary any information related to CHTable updates.\nThis PR relaxes this requirement.\n\nWe can distinguish two types of compilation requests: the ones that carry class\nload/unload information (critical requests) and the ones that do not.\nWe must process critical requests strictly in the order in which they were encountered\nat the client based on their sequence number. Non-critical requests may be executed\nin any order, however, we will impose the following rules:\n1) A non-critical request can be executed after a critical request with a higher seqNo.\nThe reason is that the non-critical request will have more up-to-date information.\n2) The opposite is not allowed: a non-critical request with a higher seqNo than a\ncritical request must wait for the critical request to be processed first.\n\nImplementation\nThe client will send not only the SeqNo of the current request, but also the SeqNo\nof the last critical request. The server receives request seqNo_N and the last critical\nrequest seqNo_M. It then checks whether seqNo_M has been processed and if it did,\nthen this request can go as well. If not, this request will be parked (put to sleep\ninto a waiting queue). When a request has been processed, it may need to notify\nother requests that are waiting in the queue. It needs to notify all waiting\nrequests up to and including the next critical request (if there is any).\nOnly critical requests need to activate threads because a comp request can only\nbe waiting for a critical request. When activating, we must check that the request\nthat is being activated does not depend on a critical request that hasn't arrived yet.\n\nSigned-off-by: Marius Pirvu <mpirvu@ca.ibm.com>"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NTQ0MDQwOTg3", "url": "https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/pull/11314#pullrequestreview-544040987", "createdAt": "2020-12-03T14:59:39Z", "commit": {"oid": "1dec903336a03141fb72de99f50d0299d8c368a0"}, "state": "APPROVED", "comments": {"totalCount": 0, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": null, "endCursor": null, "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": []}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 1676, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-10-28T17:48:14Z"}}}
