Increments to a Counter reference held that is registered to a meter registry that is cleared effectively do nothing (from the view of the registry) since the counter is no longer registered to the MeterRegistry. Making a new Spring context will make a new registry and all the metrics will be registered to that again in the remade beans. If using the API that retrieves or creates a meter, this isn't an issue (e.g. registry.counter(\"my.counter\").increment()) because the first time after clear it will create and register a Counter. Perhaps we can improve this situation or at least document it better in Micrometer.", "url": "https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/3176#discussion_r471234867", "createdAt": "2020-08-17T05:12:14Z", "author": {"login": "shakuzen"}, "path": "zipkin-server/src/test/java/zipkin2/server/internal/prometheus/ITZipkinMetricsDirty.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -41,8 +39,14 @@\n import static zipkin2.server.internal.ITZipkinServer.url;\n \n /**\n- * We cannot clear the micrometer registry easily, so we have recreate the spring context.
