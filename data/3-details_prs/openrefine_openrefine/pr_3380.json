Overview\n \n-OpenRefine is a powerful tool for learning about your dataset, even if you don\u2019t change a single character. In this section we cover different ways for sorting through, filtering, and viewing your data. \n+OpenRefine offers lots of features to help you learn about your dataset, even if you don\u2019t change a single character. In this section we cover different ways for sorting through, filtering, and viewing your data. \n \n Unlike spreadsheets, OpenRefine doesn\u2019t store formulas and display the output of those calculations; it only shows the value inside each cell. It doesn\u2019t support cell colors or text formatting. \n \n ## Data types\n \n Each piece of information (each cell) in OpenRefine is assigned a data type. Some file formats, when imported, can set data types that are recognized by OpenRefine. Cells without an associated data type on import will be considered a \u201cstring\u201d at first, but you can have OpenRefine convert cell contents into other data types later. This is set at the cell level, not at the column level. \n \n-You can see data types in action when you preview a new project: check the box that says \u201cAttempt to parse cell text into numbers\u201d and cells will be converted to the \u201cnumber\u201d data type based on their contents. You\u2019ll see numbers change from black text to green if they are recognized.\n+You can see data types in action when you preview a new project: check the box next to <span class=\"fieldLabels\">Attempt to parse cell text into numbers</span>, and cells will be converted to the \u201cnumber\u201d data type based on their contents. You\u2019ll see numbers change from black text to green if they are recognized.\n \n The data type will determine what you can do with the value. For example, if you want to add two values together, they must both be recognized as the number type. \n \n You can check data types at any time by:\n *   clicking \u201cedit\u201d on a single cell (where you can also edit the type)\n-*   creating a Custom Text Facet on a column, and inserting `type(value)` into the \u201cExpression\u201d field. This will generate the data type in the preview, and you can facet by data type if you press \u201cOK.\u201d\n+*   creating a <span class=\"menuItems\">Custom Text Facet</span> on a column, and inserting `type(value)` into the <span class=\"fieldLabels\">Expression</span> field. This will generate the data type in the preview, and you can facet by data type if you press <span class=\"buttonLabels\">OK</span>.\n \n The data types supported are:\n *   string (one or more text characters)\n *   number (one or more characters of numbers only)\n *   boolean (values of \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse\u201d)\n-*   date (ISO-8601-compliant extended format with time in UTC: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ)\n-\n-A \u201cdate\u201d type is created when a text column is [transformed into dates](transforming#to-date), or when individual cells are set to have the data type \u201cdate.\u201d \n+*   [date](#dates) (ISO-8601-compliant extended format with time in UTC: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ)\n \n OpenRefine recognizes two further data types as a result of its own processes:\n *   error\n *   null\n \n An \u201cerror\u201d data type is created when the cell is storing an error generated during a transformation in OpenRefine.\n \n-A \u201cnull\u201d data type is a special value which basically means \u201cthis cell has no value.\u201d It\u2019s used to differentiate between cells that have values such as \u201c0\u201d or \u201cfalse\u201d - or a cell that looks empty but has, for example, spaces in it. When you use `type(value)`, it will show you that the cell\u2019s value is \u201cnull\u201d and its type is \u201cundefined.\u201d You can opt to [show \u201cnull\u201d values](#view) to differentiate them from empty strings, by going to \u201cAll\u201d \u2192 \u201cView\u201d \u2192 \u201cShow/Hide \u2018null\u2019 values in cells.\u201d\n+A \u201cnull\u201d data type is a special type that means \u201cthis cell has no value.\u201d It\u2019s distinct from cells that have values such as \u201c0\u201d or \u201cfalse\u201d, or cells that look empty but have whitespace in them, or cells that contain empty strings. When you use `type(value)`, it will show you that the cell\u2019s value is \u201cnull\u201d and its type is \u201cundefined.\u201d You can opt to [show \u201cnull\u201d values](sortview#showhide-null), by going to <span class=\"menuItems\">All</span> \u2192 <span class=\"menuItems\">View</span> \u2192 <span class=\"menuItems\">Show/Hide \u2018null\u2019 values in cells</span>.\n+\n+Changing a cell's data type is not the same operation as transforming its contents. For example, using a column-wide transform such as <span class=\"menuItems\">Transform</span> \u2192 <span class=\"menuItems\">Common transforms</span> \u2192 <span class=\"menuItems\">To date</span> may not convert all values successfully, but going to an individual cell, clicking \u201cedit\u201d, and changing the data type can successfully convert text to a date. These operations use different underlying code. Learn more about date formatting and transformations in the next section. \n+\n+To transform data from one type to another, see [Transforming data](cellediting#data-type-transforms) for information on using common tranforms, and see [Expressions](expressions) for information on using [toString()](grelfunctions#tostringo-string-format-optional), [toDate()](grelfunctions#todateo-b-monthfirst-s-format1-s-format2-), and other functions. \n+\n \n-Converting a cell's data type is not the same operation as transforming its contents.

In this section we cover different ways for sorting through, filtering, and viewing your data. \n+OpenRefine offers lots of features to help you learn about your dataset, even if you don\u2019t change a single character. In this section we cover different ways for sorting through, filtering, and viewing your data. \n \n Unlike spreadsheets, OpenRefine doesn\u2019t store formulas and display the output of those calculations; it only shows the value inside each cell. It doesn\u2019t support cell colors or text formatting. \n \n ## Data types\n \n Each piece of information (each cell) in OpenRefine is assigned a data type. Some file formats, when imported, can set data types that are recognized by OpenRefine. Cells without an associated data type on import will be considered a \u201cstring\u201d at first, but you can have OpenRefine convert cell contents into other data types later. This is set at the cell level, not at the column level. \n \n-You can see data types in action when you preview a new project: check the box that says \u201cAttempt to parse cell text into numbers\u201d and cells will be converted to the \u201cnumber\u201d data type based on their contents.

You\u2019ll see numbers change from black text to green if they are recognized.\n \n The data type will determine what you can do with the value. For example, if you want to add two values together, they must both be recognized as the number type. \n \n You can check data types at any time by:\n *   clicking \u201cedit\u201d on a single cell (where you can also edit the type)\n-*   creating a Custom Text Facet on a column, and inserting `type(value)` into the \u201cExpression\u201d field. This will generate the data type in the preview, and you can facet by data type if you press \u201cOK.\u201d\n+*   creating a <span class=\"menuItems\">Custom Text Facet</span> on a column, and inserting `type(value)` into the <span class=\"fieldLabels\">Expression</span> field. This will generate the data type in the preview, and you can facet by data type if you press <span class=\"buttonLabels\">OK</span>.\n \n The data types supported are:\n *   string (one or more text characters)\n *   number (one or more characters of numbers only)\n *   boolean (values of \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse\u201d)\n-*   date (ISO-8601-compliant extended format with time in UTC: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ)\n-\n-A \u201cdate\u201d type is created when a text column is [transformed into dates](transforming#to-date), or when individual cells are set to have the data type \u201cdate.\u201d \n+*   [date](#dates) (ISO-8601-compliant extended format with time in UTC: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ)\n \n OpenRefine recognizes two further data types as a result of its own processes:\n *   error\n *   null\n \n An \u201cerror\u201d data type is created when the cell is storing an error generated during a transformation in OpenRefine.\n \n-A \u201cnull\u201d data type is a special value which basically means \u201cthis cell has no value.\u201d It\u2019s used to differentiate between cells that have values such as \u201c0\u201d or \u201cfalse\u201d - or a cell that looks empty but has, for example, spaces in it.

For example, using a column-wide transform such as <span class=\"menuItems\">Transform</span> \u2192 <span class=\"menuItems\">Common transforms</span> \u2192 <span class=\"menuItems\">To date</span> may not convert all values successfully, but going to an individual cell, clicking \u201cedit\u201d, and changing the data type can successfully convert text to a date.
