We\n+have provided tones of common utility classes such as common types of `RestrictionTracker` and\n+`WatermarkEstimator` in Beam SDK, which will help you onboard easily. As for the existing I/O\n+connectors, we have wrapped `UnboundedSource` and `BoundedSource` implementations into Splittable\n+DoFns, yet we still encourage developers to convert `UnboundedSource`/`BoundedSource` into actual\n+Splittable DoFn implementation to gain more performance benefits.\n+\n+Many thanks to every contributor who brought this highly expected design into the data processing\n+world.

Thus, it becomes much easier to develop complex I/O connectors with simpler and reusable\n+code.\n+\n+Now we are pleased to announce that Splittable DoFn is ready for use in Beam Python/Java/Go SDKs\n+starting in version 2.25.0.\n+\n+Splittable DoFn has three advantages over the existing `UnboundedSource` and `BoundedSource`:\n+* Splittable DoFn provides a unified set of APIs to handle both unbounded and bounded cases.\n+* Splittable DoFn enables reading from source descriptors dynamically.\n+  - Taking Kafka IO as an example, within `UnboundedSource`/`BoundedSource` API, you must specify\n+  the topic and partition you want to read from during pipeline construction time. There is no way\n+  for `UnboundedSource`/`BoundedSource` to accept topics and partitions as inputs during execution\n+  time. But it's native to Splittable DoFn.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "c2ae2ab459e9e19e680b1e6ff52a96253fcb4a22"}, "originalPosition": 41}]}}, {"__typename": "HeadRefForcePushedEvent", "beforeCommit": {"oid": "c2ae2ab459e9e19e680b1e6ff52a96253fcb4a22", "author": {"user": null}, "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/c2ae2ab459e9e19e680b1e6ff52a96253fcb4a22", "committedDate": "2020-12-09T21:36:30Z", "message": "Add a small announcement for Splittable DoFn."}, "afterCommit": {"oid": "8e22be2040f8d55308d11591fca68773b78a29ea", "author": {"user": null}, "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/8e22be2040f8d55308d11591fca68773b78a29ea", "committedDate": "2020-12-10T01:07:45Z", "message": "Add a small announcement for Splittable DoFn."}}, {"__typename": "HeadRefForcePushedEvent", "beforeCommit": {"oid": "8e22be2040f8d55308d11591fca68773b78a29ea", "author": {"user": null}, "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/8e22be2040f8d55308d11591fca68773b78a29ea", "committedDate": "2020-12-10T01:07:45Z", "message": "Add a small announcement for Splittable DoFn."}, "afterCommit": {"oid": "fdcd684f99cafd00701cf089b2b8f414917c51c1", "author": {"user": null}, "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/fdcd684f99cafd00701cf089b2b8f414917c51c1", "committedDate": "2020-12-10T01:23:15Z", "message": "Add a small announcement for Splittable DoFn."}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "379d7967444db0b7f5ab932fe331f9e0dea83d63", "author": {"user": null}, "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/379d7967444db0b7f5ab932fe331f9e0dea83d63", "committedDate": "2020-12-10T20:25:02Z", "message": "Add a small announcement for Splittable DoFn."}}, {"__typename": "HeadRefForcePushedEvent", "beforeCommit": {"oid": "997163781c460262f3daeafa2f98b05a7fa4a89d", "author": {"user": null}, "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/997163781c460262f3daeafa2f98b05a7fa4a89d", "committedDate": "2020-12-10T20:03:23Z", "message": "[Test Only, Will Revert] not use future date"}, "afterCommit": {"oid": "379d7967444db0b7f5ab932fe331f9e0dea83d63", "author": {"user": null}, "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/379d7967444db0b7f5ab932fe331f9e0dea83d63", "committedDate": "2020-12-10T20:25:02Z", "message": "Add a small announcement for Splittable DoFn."}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 4679, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-10-28T18:00:02Z"}}}
