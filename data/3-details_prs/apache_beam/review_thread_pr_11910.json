It will set the number of threads/subprocesses to number of cores of the machine executing the pipeline ([BEAM-9443](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9443)).\n+* Python SDK now has experimental support for SqlTransform ([BEAM-8603](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-8603)).\n+* Add OnWindowExpiration method to Stateful DoFn ([BEAM-1589](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-1589)).\n+* Added PTransforms for Google Cloud DLP (Data Loss Prevention) services integration ([BEAM-9723](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9723)):\n+    * Inspection of data,\n+    * Deidentification of data,\n+    * Reidentification of data.\n+* Add a more complete I/O support matrix in the documentation site ([BEAM-9916](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9916)).\n+* Upgrade Sphinx to 3.0.3 for building PyDoc.\n+* Added a PTransform for image annotation using Google Cloud AI image processing service\n+([BEAM-9646](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9646))\n+\n+## Breaking Changes\n+\n+* The Python SDK now requires `--job_endpoint` to be set when using `--runner=PortableRunner` ([BEAM-9860](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9860)).
