When you \n+apply a Combine transform, you must provide the function that contains the logic for combining the \n+elements or values. The combining function should be commutative and associative, as the function \n+is not necessarily invoked exactly once on all values with a given key. Because the input data \n+(including the value collection) may be distributed across multiple workers, the combining function \n+might be called multiple times to perform partial combining on subsets of the value collection.\n+\n+Simple combine operations, such as sums, can usually be implemented as a simple function.\n+\n+**Kata:** Implement the summation of numbers using \n+[beam.Combine](https://godoc.org/github.com/apache/beam/sdks/go/pkg/beam#Combine).\n+\n+<div class=\"hint\">\n+  Implement a combine function compatible with the\n+  <a href=\"https://godoc.org/github.com/apache/beam/sdks/go/pkg/beam#Combine\">\n+    beam.Combine</a> method that performs the summation of an Iterable.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "687beff6421c07ab3b370504890e082824e22cb2"}, "originalPosition": 36}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMjY5NjYyMTUxOnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "learning/katas/go/Core Transforms/Combine/Simple Function/pkg/task/task.go", "isResolved": true, "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNS0zMVQxMDowMzozMlrOGc3-Sg==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNS0zMVQxMDowMzozMlrOGc3-Sg==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzMjkzMDM3OA==", "bodyText": "Not major, but I think \"item\" can be renamed to \"num\" or \"elem\"?", "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/11866#discussion_r432930378", "createdAt": "2020-05-31T10:03:32Z", "author": {"login": "henryken"}, "path": "learning/katas/go/Core Transforms/Combine/Simple Function/pkg/task/task.go", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,26 @@\n+// Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more\n+// contributor license agreements.
