Often it is faster and simpler to perform local unit testing on your pipeline code than to debug a pipeline\u2019s remote execution.\n+\n+You can read more about testing on the Apache Beam website:\n+https://beam.apache.org/documentation/pipelines/test-your-pipeline/.\n+\n+**Kata:** Your second kata is to develop tests for your pipeline.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "b1d5c2d443ec6630a45e387adb5c0c78f68c77cc"}, "originalPosition": 31}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMjU0MTA3ODcyOnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "learning/katas/go/Introduction/Hello Beam/Hello Beam Test/go.mod", "isResolved": true, "comments": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNC0xNlQwNDo0OTozNlrOGGUc3g==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNC0xNlQwNTozMzo1NlrOGGVNkA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwOTI3OTcxMA==", "bodyText": "My IDE suggests that there are some missing indirect modules, i.e. x/lint, x/tools, go/tools.\nAre those required to be committed?\nrequire (\n\tgithub.com/apache/beam v2.19.0+incompatible\n\tgithub.com/golang/protobuf v1.3.5 // indirect\n\tgithub.com/google/go-cmp v0.4.0 // indirect\n\tgolang.org/x/lint v0.0.0-20190313153728-d0100b6bd8b3 // indirect\n\tgolang.org/x/tools v0.0.0-20190524140312-2c0ae7006135 // indirect\n\tgoogle.golang.org/grpc v1.28.1 // indirect\n\thonnef.co/go/tools v0.0.0-20190523083050-ea95bdfd59fc // indirect\n)", "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/11340#discussion_r409279710", "createdAt": "2020-04-16T04:49:36Z", "author": {"login": "henryken"}, "path": "learning/katas/go/Introduction/Hello Beam/Hello Beam Test/go.mod", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,25 @@\n+// Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more\n+// contributor license agreements.
