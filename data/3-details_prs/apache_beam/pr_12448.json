In the beam model, windowing subdivides a PCollection according to the\n+timestamps of its individual elements.\n+\n+Beam can pass information about the window and timestamp to your elements in your DoFn.  All your previous\n+lessons' DoFn had this information available, yet you never made use of it in your DoFn parameters.  In this \n+lesson you will.  The simple toy dataset has five git commit messages and their timestamps ", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "607795000f1392c6cf104040f5987ca667f637e7"}, "originalPosition": 27}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2NjA3NTA0OQ==", "bodyText": "I don't know how precise we need to be in the kata's, but consider adding.\n\"An element can be a part of one or more windows.\"", "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/12448#discussion_r466075049", "createdAt": "2020-08-06T00:23:10Z", "author": {"login": "lostluck"}, "path": "learning/katas/go/core_transforms/windowing/additional_parameters/task.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,77 @@\n+<!--\n+  ~ Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\n+  ~ or more contributor license agreements.
