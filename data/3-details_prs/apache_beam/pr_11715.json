Also worthwhile to test from = 123456789012345681L and to = 123456789012345683L. All these values (and the values in between) when converted to double and back to long round to 123456789012345680L.\nWe can solve this by having two ways to calculate this or using BigDecimal. The two ways to calculate method would use longs when (estimateRangeEnd - cur) won't overflow and doubles otherwise. Using BigDecimal with a MathContext with enough precision wouldn't run into this either and would only require one implemention (I believe DECIMAL128 should have enough precision to not run into this issue).", "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/11715#discussion_r427431140", "createdAt": "2020-05-19T16:20:33Z", "author": {"login": "lukecwik"}, "path": "sdks/java/core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/transforms/splittabledofn/GrowableOffsetRangeTracker.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,115 @@\n+/*\n+ * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\n+ * or more contributor license agreements.
