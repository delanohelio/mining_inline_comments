That PR fixes the issue and makes it available for all beam committers. Other jobs are not affected and still can be triggered by anyone.  At the same time apache GitHub organization is removed from GHPRB plugin admins.\nApache LDAP server is used as a source of the beam committers' GitHub usernames. The seed job is extended to fetch the usernames and populate GHPRB user whitelists for the jobs that are not publically triggerable.\n\nThank you for your contribution!
