It relies on\n+  a new, fully-featured transform based on file loads into BigQuery. To revert the behavior to the old implementation,\n+  you may use `--experiments=use_legacy_bq_sink`.\n+* Add cross-language support to Java's JdbcIO, now available in the Python module `apache_beam.io.jdbc` ([BEAM-10135](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-10135), [BEAM-10136](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-10136)).\n+* Add support of AWS SDK v2 for KinesisIO.Read (Java) ([BEAM-9702](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9702)).\n+* Add streaming support to SnowflakeIO in Java SDK ([BEAM-9896](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9896))\n+* Support reading and writing to Google Healthcare DICOM APIs in Python SDK ([BEAM-10601](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-10601))\n+* Add dispositions for SnowflakeIO.write ([BEAM-10343](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-10343))\n+* Add cross-language support to SnowflakeIO.Read now available in the Python module `apache_beam.io.external.snowflake` ([BEAM-9897](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9897)).\n+\n+## New Features / Improvements\n+\n+* Shared library for simplifying management of large shared objects added to Python SDK. Example use case is sharing a large TF model object across threads ([BEAM-10417](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-10417)).\n+* Dataflow streaming timers are not strictly time ordered when set earlier mid-bundle ([BEAM-8543](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-8543)).\n+* OnTimerContext should not create a new one when processing each element/timer in FnApiDoFnRunner ([BEAM-9839](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9839))\n+* Key should be available in @OnTimer methods (Spark Runner) ([BEAM-9850](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9850))\n+\n+## Breaking Changes\n+\n+* WriteToBigQuery transforms now require a GCS location to be provided through either\n+  custom_gcs_temp_location in the constructor of WriteToBigQuery or the fallback option\n+  --temp_location, or pass method=\"STREAMING_INSERTS\" to WriteToBigQuery ([BEAM-6928](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-6928)).\n+", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "b8faa7399f16fcffedaa7d551dade09c38d68b5d"}, "originalPosition": 56}]}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 424, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-12T09:44:50Z"}}}
