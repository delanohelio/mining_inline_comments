Our exclude patterns target autogenerated files.  So, if a new autogenerated file were added to the repo which was excluded in .yapfignore but not in .pre-commit-config.yaml (which I think would be the most common \"failure\" scenario), then the first time that a developer with pre-commit enabled changed that file (say, by regenerating it) and tried to commit those changes, yapf would autoformat it, and then pre-commit would fail the commit with a message like this:\nyapf.....................................................................Failed\n- hook id: yapf\n- files were modified by this hook\n\nAt this point hopefully the developer realizes that the failure is due to yapf, and finds the trail of comments leading them to .pre-commit-config.yaml.  Worst case scenario is that they commit it with the autoformatted changes, which would be pretty innocuous, and would not fail any jenkins tests because those same autogenerated files are excluded from pylint.\nAnother thing to note is that this is all just a convenience for developers.  Jenkins remains our last line of defense.\nAlso note that it's possible to invoke your lint tools using pre-commit within tox, so that you can consolidate all of your includes and excludes across all tools into one file, the pre-commit-config.yaml.
