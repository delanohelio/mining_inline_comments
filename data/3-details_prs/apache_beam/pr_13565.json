Consider subscribing to the [dev@ mailing list](/community/contact-us/), especially\n-   if you plan to make more than one change or the change will be large. All decisions happen on the\n-   public dev list.\n-1. (Optionally) Join the [#beam channel of the ASF slack](/community/contact-us/).\n-1. Create an account on [Beam issue tracker (JIRA)](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues)\n-   (anyone can do this).\n-\n-### Share your intent\n-\n-1. Find or create an issue in the [Beam issue tracker (JIRA)](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues).\n-   Tracking your work in an issue will avoid duplicated or conflicting work, and provide\n-   a place for notes. Later, your pull request will be linked to the issue as well.\n-1. If you want to get involved but don't have a project in mind, check our list of open starter tasks,\n-   [https://s.apache.org/beam-starter-tasks](https://s.apache.org/beam-starter-tasks).\n-1. Assign the issue to yourself. To get the permission to do so, email\n-   the [dev@ mailing list](/community/contact-us)\n-   to introduce yourself and to be added as a contributor in the Beam issue tracker including your\n-   ASF Jira Username. For example [this welcome email](\n-   https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/e6018c2aaf7dc7895091434295e5b0fafe192b975e3e3761fcf0cda7@%3Cdev.beam.apache.org%3E).\n-1. If your change is large or it is your first change, it is a good idea to\n-   [discuss it on the dev@ mailing list](/community/contact-us/).\n-1. For large changes create a design doc\n-   ([template](https://s.apache.org/beam-design-doc-template),\n-   [examples](https://s.apache.org/beam-design-docs)) and email it to the [dev@ mailing list](/community/contact-us).\n-\n-### Development Setup\n-\n-1. If you need help with git forking, cloning, branching, committing, pull requests, and squashing commits, see\n-   [Git workflow tips](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/BEAM/Git+Tips)\n-1. Familiarize yourself with gradle and the project structure. At the root of the git repository, run:\n-\n-       $ ./gradlew projects\n-\n-   Examine the available tasks in a project. For the default set of tasks, use:\n-\n-       $ ./gradlew tasks\n-\n-   For a given module, use:\n-\n-       $ ./gradlew -p sdks/java/io/cassandra tasks\n-\n-    For an exhaustive list of tasks, use:\n-\n-       $ ./gradlew tasks --all\n-\n-1. Make sure you can build and run tests\n-\n-    Run the entire set of tests with:\n+</br>\n \n-       $ ./gradlew check\n+Linux users should configure their machines for sudoless Docker.\n \n-   You can limit testing to a particular module. Gradle will build just the necessary things to run those tests.

Now you may want to set up your preferred IDE and other aspects of your development\n-   environment. See the Developers' wiki for tips, guides, and FAQs on:\n-   - [IntelliJ](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/BEAM/Using+IntelliJ+IDE)\n-   - [Java](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/BEAM/Java+Tips)\n-   - [Python](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/BEAM/Python+Tips)\n-   - [Go](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/BEAM/Go+Tips)\n-   - [Website](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/BEAM/Website+Tips)\n-   - [Gradle](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/BEAM/Gradle+Tips)\n-   - [Jenkins](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/BEAM/Jenkins+Tips)\n-   - [FAQ](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/BEAM/Contributor+FAQ)\n+ <a class=\"arrow-list-header\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" href=\"#collapseOverview\" role=\"button\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapseOverview\">\n+  {{< figure src=\"/images/arrow-icon_list.svg\">}}\n \n-### Make your change\n+Overview\n \n-1. Make your code change. Every source file needs to include the Apache license header. Every new dependency needs to\n-   have an open source license [compatible](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#criteria) with Apache.\n+  </a>\n \n-1. Add unit tests for your change.\n+<div class=\"collapse\" id=\"collapseOverview\">\n \n-1. Use descriptive commit messages that make it easy to identify changes and provide a clear history.\n+There are lots of opportunities to contribute. You can for example:\n \n-1. When your change is ready to be reviewed and merged, create a pull request.\n+- ask or answer questions on [user@beam.apache.org](/community/contact-us/) or\n+  [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/apache-beam)\n+- review proposed design ideas on [dev@beam.apache.org](/community/contact-us/)\n+- file [bug reports](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues)\n+- review [changes](https://github.com/apache/beam/pulls)\n+- work on the core programming model (what is a Beam pipeline and how does it\n+  run?)\n+- improve the developer experience (for example, Windows guides)\n+- organize local meetups of users or contributors to Apache Beam\n \n-1. Format commit messages and the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`,\n-   where you replace BEAM-XXX with the appropriate JIRA issue.\n-   This will automatically link the pull request to the issue.\n+...and many more. Most importantly, if you have an idea of how to contribute, then do it!\n \n-1. The pull request and any changes pushed to it will trigger [pre-commit\n-   jobs](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/BEAM/Contribution+Testing+Guide#ContributionTestingGuide-Pre-commit). If a test fails and appears unrelated to your\n-   change, you can cause tests to be re-run by adding a single line comment on your\n-   PR\n+</div>\n \n-        retest this please\n+<a class=\"arrow-list-header\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" href=\"#collapseContributing\" role=\"button\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapseContributing\">\n+   {{< figure src=\"/images/arrow-icon_list.svg\">}}\n \n-   Pull request template has a link to a [catalog of trigger phrases](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/.test-infra/jenkins/README.md)\n-   that start various post-commit tests suites. Use these sparingly because post-commit tests consume shared development resources.\n+Contributing code\n \n-1. Pull requests can only be merged by a\n-   [Beam committer](https://home.apache.org/phonebook.html?pmc=beam).\n-   To find a committer for your area, either:\n-    - look in the OWNERS file of the directory where you changed files, or\n-    - look for similar code merges, or\n-    - ask on [dev@beam.apache.org](/community/contact-us/)\n+  </a>\n \n-   Use `R: @username` in the pull request to notify a reviewer.\n+<div class=\"collapse\" id=\"collapseContributing\">\n \n-1. If you don't get any response in 3 business days, email the [dev@ mailing list](/community/contact-us) to ask for someone to look at your pull\n-   request.\n-\n-### Make the reviewer's job easier\n-\n-1. Provide context for your changes in the associated JIRA issue and/or PR description.\n-\n-1. Avoid huge mega-changes.\n-\n-1. Review feedback typically leads to follow-up changes. It is easier to review follow-up changes when they are added as additional \"fixup\" commits to the\n-   existing PR/branch. This allows reviewer(s) to track the incremental progress and focus on new changes,\n-   and keeps comment threads attached to the code.\n-   Please refrain from squashing new commits into reviewed commits before review is completed.\n-   Because squashing reviewed and unreviewed commits often makes it harder to\n-   see the the difference between the review iterations, reviewers may ask you to unsquash new changes.\n-\n-1. After review is complete and the PR is accepted, fixup commits should be squashed (see [Git workflow tips](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/BEAM/Git+Tips)).\n-   Beam committers [can squash](https://beam.apache.org/contribute/committer-guide/#merging-it)\n-   all commits in the PR during merge, however if a PR has a mixture of independent changes that should not be squashed, and fixup commits,\n-   then the PR author should help squashing fixup commits to maintain a clean commmit history.\n-\n-## When will my change show up in an Apache Beam release?\n-\n-Apache Beam makes minor releases every 6 weeks. Apache Beam has a\n-[calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=0p73sl034k80oob7seouanigd0%40group.calendar.google.com) for\n-cutting the next release branch. Your change needs to be checked into master before the release branch is cut\n-to make the next release.\n-\n-## Stale pull requests\n+Below is a tutorial for contributing code to Beam, covering our tools and typical process in\n+detail.\n \n-The community will close stale pull requests in order to keep the project\n-healthy. A pull request becomes stale after its author fails to respond to\n-actionable comments for 60 days.  Author of a closed pull request is welcome to\n-reopen the same pull request again in the future. The associated JIRAs will be\n-unassigned from the author but will stay open.\n+- a GitHub account\n+- a Linux, macOS, or Microsoft Windows development environment with Java JDK 8 installed\n+- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed for some tasks including building worker containers and testing this website\n+  changes locally\n+- [Go](https://golang.org) 1.12 or later installed for Go SDK development\n+- Python 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8.

Perform such retries at the narrowest scope possible in order to minimize the amount of retried work (i.e. ideally at the level of the RPC library itself, or at the level of directly sending the failing RPC to a third-party system). Otherwise, let the runner retry work at the appropriate level of granularity for you (different runners may have different retry behavior, but most of them do *some* retrying).\n-* If the transform has side effects, strive to make them idempotent (i.e. safe to apply multiple times). Due to retries, the side effects may be executed multiple times, possibly in parallel.\n-* If the transform can have unprocessable (permanently failing) records and you want the pipeline to proceed despite that:\n-    * If bad records are safe to ignore, count the bad records in a metric. Make sure the transform's documentation mentions this aggregator. Beware that there is no programmatic access to reading the aggregator value from inside the pipeline during execution.\n-    * If bad records may need manual inspection by the user, emit them into an output that contains only those records.\n-    * Alternatively take a (default zero) threshold above which element failures become bundle failures (structure the transform to count the total number of elements and of failed elements, compare them and fail if failures are above the threshold).\n-* If the user requests a higher data consistency guarantee than you're able to provide, fail.

E.g.:\n \n-* Are the input and output collections of this transform bounded or unbounded, or can it work with either?\n-* If the transform writes data to a third-party system, does it guarantee that data will be written at least once? at most once? exactly once? (how does it achieve exactly-once in case the runner executes a bundle multiple times due to retries or speculative execution a.k.a. backups?)\n-* If the transform reads data from a third-party system, what's the maximum potential degree of parallelism of the read? E.g., if the transform reads data sequentially (e.g. executes a single SQL query), documentation should mention that.\n-* If the transform is querying an external system during processing (e.g. joining a `PCollection` with information from an external key-value store), what are the guarantees on freshness of queried data: e.g. is it all loaded at the beginning of the transform, or queried per-element (in that case, what if data for a single element changes while the transform runs)?\n-* If there's a non-trivial relationship between arrival of items in the input `PCollection` and emitting output into the output `PCollection`, what is this relationship?

(e.g. if the transform internally does windowing, triggering, grouping, or uses the state or timers API)\n \n ### Logging\n \n Anticipate abnormal situations that a user of the transform may run into. Log information that they would have found sufficient for debugging, but limit the volume of logging. Here is some advice that applies to all programs, but is especially important when data volume is massive and execution is distributed.\n \n Do:\n \n-* When handling an error from a third-party system, log the full error with any error details the third-party system provides about it, and include any additional context the transform knows. This enables the user to take action based on the information provided in the message. When handling an exception and rethrowing your own exception, wrap the original exception in it (some languages offer more advanced facilities, e.g. Java's \"suppressed exceptions\"). Never silently drop available information about an error.\n-* When performing a rare (not per-element) and slow operation (e.g. expanding a large file-pattern, or initiating an import/export job), log when the operation begins and ends. If the operation has an identifier, log the identifier, so the user can look up the operation for later debugging.\n-* When computing something low-volume that is critically important for correctness or performance of further processing, log the input and output, so a user in the process of debugging can sanity-check them or reproduce an abnormal result manually.\n-E.g. when expanding a filepattern into files, log what the filepattern was and how many parts it was split into; when executing a query, log the query and log how many results it produced.\n+- When handling an error from a third-party system, log the full error with any error details the third-party system provides about it, and include any additional context the transform knows.

Because of that, testing is particularly important.\n \n #### Testing the transform's run-time behavior\n \n-* Unit-test the overall semantics of the transform using `TestPipeline` and `PAssert`. Start with testing against the direct runner. Assertions on `PCollection` contents should be strict: e.g. when a read from a database is expected to read the numbers 1 through 10, assert not just that there are 10 elements in the output `PCollection`, or that each element is in the range [1, 10] - but assert that each number 1 through 10 appears exactly once.\n-* Identify non-trivial sequential logic in the transform that is prone to corner cases which are difficult to reliably simulate using a `TestPipeline`, extract this logic into unit-testable functions, and unit-test them. Common corner cases are:\n-    * `DoFn`s processing empty bundles\n-    * `DoFn`s processing extremely large bundles (contents doesn't fit in memory, including \"hot keys\" with a very large number of values)\n-    * Third-party APIs failing\n-    * Third-party APIs providing wildly inaccurate information\n-    * Leaks of `Closeable`/`AutoCloseable` resources in failure cases\n-    * Common corner cases when developing sources: complicated arithmetic in `BoundedSource.split` (e.g. splitting key or offset ranges), iteration over empty data sources or composite data sources that have some empty components.\n-* Mock out the interactions with third-party systems, or better, use [\"fake\"](https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html) implementations when available. Make sure that the mocked-out interactions are representative of all interesting cases of the actual behavior of these systems.\n-* To unit test `DoFn`s, `CombineFn`s, and `BoundedSource`s, consider using `DoFnTester`, `CombineFnTester`, and `SourceTestUtils` respectively which can exercise the code in non-trivial ways to flesh out potential bugs.\n-* For transforms that work over unbounded collections, test their behavior in the presence of late or out-of-order data using `TestStream`.\n-* Tests must pass 100% of the time, including in hostile, CPU- or network-constrained environments (continuous integration servers). Never put timing-dependent code (e.g. sleeps) into tests. Experience shows that no reasonable amount of sleeping is enough - code can be suspended for more than several seconds.\n-* For detailed instructions on test code organization, see the [Beam Testing Guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/BEAM/Contribution+Testing+Guide).\n+- Unit-test the overall semantics of the transform using `TestPipeline` and `PAssert`.

However, minor mistakes or typos in it can have serious consequences (e.g. ignoring a property that the user has set), so it needs to be tested as well. Yet, an excessive amount of trivial tests can be hard to maintain and give a false impression that the transform is well-tested.\n \n Do:\n-* Test non-trivial validation code, where missing/incorrect/uninformative validation may lead to serious problems: data loss, counter-intuitive behavior, value of a property being silently ignored, or other hard-to-debug errors. Create 1 test per non-trivial class of validation error. Some examples of validation that should be tested:\n-    * If properties `withFoo()` and `withBar()` cannot both be specified at the same time, test that a transform specifying both of them is rejected, rather than one of the properties being silently ignored at runtime.\n-    * If the transform is known to behave incorrectly or counter-intuitively for a particular configuration, test that this configuration is rejected, rather than producing wrong results at runtime. For example, a transform might work properly only for bounded collections, or only for globally-windowed collections. Or, suppose a streaming system supports several levels of \"quality of service\", one of which is \"exactly once delivery\". However, a transform that writes to this system might be unable to provide exactly-once due to retries in case of failures. In that case, test that the transform disallows specifying exactly-once QoS, rather than failing to provide the expected end-to-end semantics at runtime.\n-* Test that each `withFoo()` method (including each overload) has effect (is not ignored), using `TestPipeline` and `PAssert` to create tests where the expected test results depend on the value of `withFoo()`.\n+\n+- Test non-trivial validation code, where missing/incorrect/uninformative validation may lead to serious problems: data loss, counter-intuitive behavior, value of a property being silently ignored, or other hard-to-debug errors.
