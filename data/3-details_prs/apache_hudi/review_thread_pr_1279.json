Can you please make another pass for any lines we missed like this\n\n@vinothchandar I looked at this. This is my understanding. Please correct if I am wrong.\nWhen we refer to \"snapshot\" it means  queries can see data committed as of that point in time. For COW table type, this refers to latest parquet files for each file group. For MOR table type snapshot queries can see real-time data merged from base Parquet file and delta log file (AVRO files). Wrt Presto specifically, we are not supporting reading from avro files yet (referring to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-305) . So I kept this as ReadOptimized instead of Snapshot.  Later when we support this, we can switch to Snapshot query support in Presto.
