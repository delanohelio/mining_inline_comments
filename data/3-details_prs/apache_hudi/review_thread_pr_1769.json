Currently, it's implementations has InMemoryMetricsReporter, JmxMetricsReporter, MetricsGraphiteReporter and DatadogMetricsReporter. Since InMemoryMetricsReporter is only used for testing, we will introduce the other three implementations.\n+\n+### JmxMetricsReporter\n+\n+JmxMetricsReporter is a implementation of Jmx reporter, which used to report jmx metric.\n+\n+#### Configurations\n+The following is an example of configuration as JXM. The detailed configuration can refer to [here](configurations.html#jmx).\n+\n+  ```properties\n+  hoodie.metrics.on=true\n+  hoodie.metrics.reporter.type=JMX\n+  hoodie.metrics.jmx.host=192.168.0.106\n+  hoodie.metrics.jmx.port=4001\n+  ```\n+\n+#### Demo\n+As configuration above, Hudi metrics will started JMX server on port 4001. Then we can start jconsole to connect to 192.168.0.106:4001. Below is a sample of monitoring hudi jmx metrics through jconsole.\n+<figure>\n+    <img class=\"docimage\" src=\"/assets/images/hudi_jxm_metrics.png\" alt=\"hudi_jxm_metrics.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%\" />\n+</figure>\n+\n+### MetricsGraphiteReporter\n+\n+MetricsGraphiteReporter is a implementation of Graphite reporter, which connects to the Graphite server, and send metrics to that server.\n+\n+#### Configurations\n+The following is an example of configuration as GRAPHITE. The detailed configuration can refer to [here](configurations.html#graphite).\n+\n+  ```properties\n+  hoodie.metrics.on=true\n+  hoodie.metrics.reporter.type=GRAPHITE\n+  hoodie.metrics.graphite.host=192.168.0.106\n+  hoodie.metrics.graphite.port=2003\n+  hoodie.metrics.graphite.metric.prefix=<your metrics prefix>\n+  ```\n+#### Demo\n+As configuration above, we should first start graphite server on host 192.168.0.106 and port 2003, Hudi metrics will connect to graphite server, and report Hudi metrics to graphite server. Below is a sample of monitoring hudi metrics through graphite.\n+  <figure>\n+      <img class=\"docimage\" src=\"/assets/images/hudi_graphite_metrics.png\" alt=\"hudi_graphite_metrics.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%\" />\n+  </figure>\n+\n+### DatadogMetricsReporter\n+\n+DatadogMetricsReporter is a implementation of Datadog reporter.\n+A reporter which publishes metric values to Datadog monitoring service via Datadog HTTP API.\n+\n+#### Configurations\n+The following is an example of configuration as Datadog. The detailed configuration can refer to [here](configurations.html#datadog).\n+\n+```properties\n+hoodie.metrics.on=true\n+hoodie.metrics.reporter.type=DATADOG\n+hoodie.metrics.datadog.api.site=EU # or US\n+hoodie.metrics.datadog.api.key=<your api key>\n+hoodie.metrics.datadog.metric.prefix=<your metrics prefix>\n+```\n+\n+ * `hoodie.metrics.datadog.api.site` will set the Datadog API site, It determines whether the requests will be sent to api.datadoghq.eu (EU) or api.datadoghq.com (US).
