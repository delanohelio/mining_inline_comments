This feature was in experimental mode before this release. Embedded Timeline Server caches file listing calls in Spark driver and serves them to Spark writer tasks. This reduces the number of file listings needed to be performed for each write.\n * Incremental Cleaning is enabled by default for both delta-streamer and spark datasource writes. This feature was also in experimental mode before this release. In the steady state, incremental cleaning avoids the costly step of scanning all partitions and instead uses Hudi metadata to find files to be cleaned up.\n * Delta-streamer config files can now be placed in different filesystem than actual data.\n * Hudi Hive Sync now supports tables partitioned by date type column.\n * Hudi Hive Sync now supports syncing directly via Hive MetaStore.\n * Other Writer Performance related fixes:\n ** DataSource Writer now avoids unnecessary loading of data after write.\n ** Hudi Writer now leverages spark parallelism when searching for existing files for writing new records.\n \n### Raw Release Notes\n   The raw release notes are available [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12322822&version=12348256)", "url": "https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1683#discussion_r441098846", "createdAt": "2020-06-16T19:43:00Z", "author": {"login": "bvaradar"}, "path": "docs/_pages/releases.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -3,8 +3,40 @@ title: \"Releases\"\n permalink: /releases\n layout: releases\n toc: true\n-last_modified_at: 2019-12-30T15:59:57-04:00\n+last_modified_at: 2020-05-28T08:40:00-07:00\n ---\n+## [Release 0.5.3](https://github.com/apache/hudi/releases/tag/release-0.5.3) ([docs](/docs/0.5.3-quick-start-guide.html))\n+\n+### Download Information\n+ * Source Release : [Apache Hudi 0.5.3 Source Release](https://downloads.apache.org/hudi/0.5.3/hudi-0.5.3.src.tgz) ([asc](https://downloads.apache.org/hudi/0.5.3/hudi-0.5.3.src.tgz.asc), [sha512](https://downloads.apache.org/hudi/0.5.3/hudi-0.5.3.src.tgz.sha512))\n+ * Apache Hudi jars corresponding to this release is available [here](https://repository.apache.org/#nexus-search;quick~hudi)\n+\n+### Release Highlights\n+ * Since this is a bug fix release, not a lot of new features as such.
