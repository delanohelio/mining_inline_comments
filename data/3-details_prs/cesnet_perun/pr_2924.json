On the left side, you have data from the database. So, for example:\nfirst_name = 'Michal'\nmiddle_name = ''\nlast_name = 'Stava'\nthe operation || will join these Strings, and I expect something like 'MichalStava'. Then we expect that it should be the same as the input from the user (the variable :nameString) where I would expect something like \"Michal Stava\".
