I don't think locking actually really helps.\nThe scenarios I see:\nCase A)\n-> Tile grabs game lock\n-> Game update blocks waiting for lock\n-> Tile finishes rendering release lock\n-> Game  update happens. The tile rendering is now wrong and out of date\n-> (hopefully) Game update triggers a new rendering\n-> tile grabs an uncontested lock and does its rendering job.\nIf the tile blocks on a game update, then the tile is going to get correct data and just render once, but if the tile is locking first then it seems like the output will become wrong unless a new rendering occurs. I think a lot of TripleA locking is incorrect in this way, locks are grabbed to prevent contention during rendering, but we wind up with a stale result rendered and it's wrong anyways in the end, which means that just simply grabbing locks is not enough to get correctness. I think there are two problems: 1) concurrent changes and idempotent results, but also 2) result freshness and not rendering stale (and incorrect) data.\nTL:DR, I've long wondered why Tile doesn't just create an immutable copy and render that, it would be just as correct as if it had grabbed a lock.", "url": "https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/pull/6046#discussion_r392563066", "createdAt": "2020-03-14T06:52:35Z", "author": {"login": "DanVanAtta"}, "path": "game-core/src/main/java/games/strategy/triplea/ui/screen/Tile.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -15,9 +15,6 @@\n import java.util.List;", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "604a2f4da781ca08465f56bca0a92ec2b3eb3e9b"}, "originalPosition": 1}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5MjU2NTQyOA==", "bodyText": "We can agree that the way it currently works is definitely weird.\nIf I understand it correctly, the lock is currently used for 2 separate things:\n\nAcquire a lock while rendering in order to \"batch\" all the rendering so the image is never drawn mid-render.\nSynchronize access to the underlying collection that stores all the IDrawables.\n\nMy planned follow-up PR gets rid of the first usage.
