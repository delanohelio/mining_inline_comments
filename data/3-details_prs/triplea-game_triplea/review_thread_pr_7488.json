The tests closing are pretty much a System.exit, after which the connections should not survive. If we created many connections, then perhaps they would stack up, but we only have one.

Specifically this is one test file where you have a 'beforeAll' and an 'afterAll' being executed. By making the support and JDBI variables static we ensure that we only have one copy between tests (across life cycle). The 'support.before' is what launches the server and it's a no-op if the server already exists.

I found that that when we hit the 'beforeAll' the stored value is always initially unset.\nSo I think it depends on how you define individual tests. For the context of a store, that means the \"@test\" methods, not the test file. Once the 'afterAll' is executed, it seems the store is wiped away. AFAIK the extension is instantiated on each test class that has it, hence the beforeAll and afterAll are executed as part of each test files life cycle.\n\nI mean on the same level one could argue that memory leaks in test code is fine because the tests never run for a long amount of time, but I just feel like some mechanism should take care of that.\n\nWe should avoid hyperbole, but one could make the same argument that you should set all of your variables to null to explicitly close them. It seems that the 'support' is doing its job of closing when the tests exit. I don't think there is a memory leak here at all. If you re-run the tests, you'll have all memory reclaimed in-between.\nDB connections can be leaked and remain open. Tomee is an example of a server notorious for that and after enough restarts your DB crashes because you exhaust all available connections. It's not the case for us though, DB connections are being closed and the server is being stopped.\nDo we need the server to be stopped after a sup-project is done being tested? No.\nCan we stop a server after the sub-project is done being tested? I'm not sure if we can, it requires the test runner to know that there are more test files to be executed. AfterAll is just the scope of one test file.\nI don't think what we're doing here is actually all that dirty at all even. static variables can lead to some dangerous patterns, but this seems like an exact fit for what we want here.", "url": "https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/pull/7488#discussion_r479800181", "createdAt": "2020-08-30T18:19:19Z", "author": {"login": "DanVanAtta"}, "path": "dropwizard-common-test/src/main/java/org/triplea/dropwizard/test/DropwizardServerExtension.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -60,25 +60,24 @@\n   @Override\n   public void beforeAll(final ExtensionContext context) {\n     final DropwizardTestSupport<C> support = getSupport();\n-    try {\n-      log.info(\"Starting local server for testing..\");\n-      support.before();\n+    log.info(\"Starting local server for testing..\");\n+    support.before();\n+\n+    if (jdbi == null) {\n       jdbi =\n           Jdbi.create(getDatabase().getUrl(), getDatabase().getUser(), getDatabase().getPassword());\n       jdbi.installPlugin(new SqlObjectPlugin());\n       rowMappers().forEach(jdbi::registerRowMapper);\n-\n       log.info(\"Created JDBI connection to: {}\", getDatabase().getUrl());\n-      final String localUri = \"http://localhost:\" + support.getLocalPort();\n-      serverUri = URI.create(localUri);\n-      log.info(\"Local server URL set to: {}\", localUri);\n-    } catch (final RuntimeException e) {\n-      log.warn(\"Ignoring setup error, server already started: {}\", e.getMessage());\n     }\n+\n+    final String localUri = \"http://localhost:\" + support.getLocalPort();\n+    serverUri = URI.create(localUri);\n+    log.info(\"Local server URL set to: {}\", localUri);", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ3OTc4MTY4NQ=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "3f5ef5bf9df456755b351caeb0aa6d553d348426"}, "originalPosition": 44}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ3OTgwMDM3MQ==", "bodyText": "Fair point, but not the cleanest approach in my opinion.\nI mean on the same level one could argue that memory leaks in test code is fine because the tests never run for a long amount of time, but I just feel like some mechanism should take care of that.\n\nIf memory or connections are still allocated after a System.exit, that is a leak and would be bad for any kind of code.
