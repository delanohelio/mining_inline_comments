This way, the PlayerSelectorRow can check that static string instead of static player type, as the player type is no longer static.\nRelease Note", "createdAt": "2020-12-20T23:42:34Z", "url": "https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/pull/8472", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "c06562fd6afeb87fa87870a81604f667a82dea21"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-12-21T03:58:32Z", "author": {"login": "trevan"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 4, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABdoKGS8AH2gAyNTQzMTUwMjQzOmQwYzFkMzQ2MDAxZmViMmFmN2IxNjM4Yjg1NmU1NTMzYzU0YTI2ZWI=", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABdoNWHuAH2gAyNTQzMTUwMjQzOjgzYmZjMjYwYjI0Yjg2ZjNkM2RkMjU5MjFiYzcyYWI5NTNkNTYyZDI=", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "d0c1d346001feb2af7b1638b856e5533c54a26eb", "author": {"user": {"login": "trevan", "name": null}}, "url": "https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/commit/d0c1d346001feb2af7b1638b856e5533c54a26eb", "committedDate": "2020-12-20T23:40:08Z", "message": "Move the DoesNothingAi to the ai package\n\nThe DoesNothingAi label is defined in PlayerTypes because it is used in\nthe player selection to pick a default AI for certain types of players."}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NTU2MDg3NDY5", "url": "https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/pull/8472#pullrequestreview-556087469", "createdAt": "2020-12-21T01:35:29Z", "commit": {"oid": "d0c1d346001feb2af7b1638b856e5533c54a26eb"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 4, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMi0yMVQwMTozNTozMFrOIJJ1nw==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMi0yMVQwMTo0NTowMFrOIJJ8Tw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0NjQ2OTI3OQ==", "bodyText": "nit, does nothing is two words, canonical convention for the project is to word-split packages with periods.\nIE: org.triplea.ai.does.nothing\nI do like on the other hand that 'doesnothing' represents a singular entity, I think it's then a toss up.
