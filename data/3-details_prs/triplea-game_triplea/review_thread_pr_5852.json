Roles\n-can be thought of as an applications. The roles are defined by the\n-folders in the 'roles' folder. Ansible roles have a standard file format\n-where variables are defined. In this project the two files of most\n-note are \"defaults/main.yml\", which defines all variables to be used\n-in a role, and \"tasks/main.yml\" which defines a series of tasks to execute.\n-\n-It's also notewory that 'group_vars' can be used to define environment\n-specific variables.
