If duplicates are just inefficient, then it's on the caller for not doing the cleanup first, and you may be incurring worse efficiencies by forcing a collection copy. At the end of the day it's a trust that the implementation type satisfies any contract that you need. If you need unique items, then the contract should be set, if you need ordering, then list, if you really don't care (but set would be more efficient), then use collection and hope that callers give you a set (or handle it in the processing).", "url": "https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/pull/6233#discussion_r407818400", "createdAt": "2020-04-14T01:50:45Z", "author": {"login": "DanVanAtta"}, "path": "game-core/src/main/java/games/strategy/engine/data/UnitTypeList.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -40,6 +44,22 @@ public UnitType getUnitType(final String name) {\n     return types;\n   }\n \n+  /**\n+   * Returns the unit support rules for the unit types.
