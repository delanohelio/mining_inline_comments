The data is injected in a static way, but the data used has no examples of being static (the data is always injected).\nStatic coupling is worse the deeper it is in the system. One can consider a number of examples, let's say ClientSettings was initialized at a low level. It would be hard to reason about and appear as a very interesting side effect. It would be very painful to determine the ordering of when something is initialized\nHigher level modules depend on lower level modules, the more static coupling in lower level modules, transitively, the more coupling you have on the higher level modules.\nImperative shell, functional core is broken, a low level module with static data coupling is not functional. This can be viewed from the perspective of a dependency graph, if low level modules have dependencies on other modules and not just their higher level modules, it creates a tangle of dependencies.\nLow level modules with tight coupling are harder to re-use\nThe testing paradigm shifts and you get the anti-pattern of nearly all integration tests to test anything. Higher level are often tested at a system and integration level, which is fine as you would really want to 'new' up the Injections module. In other words, having a higher level module that has mocks for all of its low level systems is not that valuable of a test (at that point it's just verifying wiring, and a test that just verifies that a series of mock objects have called each other is not necessarily that valuable). Meanwhile, testing a low level module in isolation can be useful and valuable. If you have a tight coupling then either you need to instantiate that framework, which means testing is difficult and dependent on that framework (very painful if the framework changes and can introduce dependencies between tests), or a person is using mock objects to inject mock behavior which is also not great as mocks create implementation dependencies between test and the code under test. Meanwhile if you have a low level object, and you can just pass data to it, and assert return values, then the test is not dependent on implementation and is the most flexible (which is great, because you can then change implementation and not have to rewrite the test. No testing is worse than poor testing, but working in an environment where a single change leads to several hours of updating many tests is not great).", "url": "https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/pull/8468#discussion_r546443932", "createdAt": "2020-12-20T22:16:53Z", "author": {"login": "DanVanAtta"}, "path": "game-core/src/main/java/games/strategy/engine/framework/startup/launcher/LocalLauncher.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -123,13 +122,19 @@ public static LocalLauncher create(\n                     PlayerCountrySelection::getPlayerName,\n                     PlayerCountrySelection::isPlayerEnabled));\n \n-    final PlayerListing pl =\n+    final PlayerListing playerListing =\n         new PlayerListing(\n             playersEnabled,\n             playerTypes,\n             gameSelectorModel.getGameData().getGameVersion(),\n             gameSelectorModel.getGameName(),\n             gameSelectorModel.getGameRound());\n-    return new LocalLauncher(gameSelectorModel, new PlainRandomSource(), pl, parent, launchAction);\n+    return new LocalLauncher(", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0NjQyOTIzOQ=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "90d524b37e8af88bb9ac0e0de1394f6235c6316d"}, "originalPosition": 50}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0NjQ0NDA5OA==", "bodyText": "TL;DR\n\nI don't want us to start a pattern of using Injections for static data.\nlow level static coupling is worse than static coupling at higher levels.\n\nIf we keep moving the coupling up levels, then eventually we will have most of the initialization code in one place.
