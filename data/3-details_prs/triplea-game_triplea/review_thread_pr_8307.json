For example, if you move units one by one, they'll get AA shots one-by-one when in actuality the rules treat movements as all happening concurrently at the end of the move phase. Hence, if you move a second unit along the same path, the two units shared path.\nNow, we can probably split hairs here as there are implications for capturing unoccuppied territories and the fly-over that is allowed because of that. I can't recall if that is technically a mis-implementation or a special case of the rules somehow, or if the interpretation of concurrent moves is otherwise flawed.\nIMO, we should remove this comment or move it somewhere else.
