For example re-ordering or renaming variables and methods\n+  can break compatibility between TripleA Versions.\n+\n+## Testing Responsibility\n+Each contributor should test their changes thoroughly. We wish to minimize\n+problems when it comes time for releases. The goal is small, incremental,\n+and solid changes.\n+\n+TripleA lacks automated testing and the manual testing overhead is large.\n+For now the manual testing needs to be done to ensure we keep a solid\n+codebase going forward.\n+\n+Automated tests are hugely welcome, TripleA needs lots more so that the\n+manual testing can be reduced and changes made with confidence.\n+\n+## Things to watch out for - Compatibility Breakers\n+There are three ares to be concerned about compatibility:\n+1. Save game serialization. Elements of `GameData.java` are serialized to a file\n+and then loaded again. Private variable changes here can break things. To test this,\n+save a game file, make changes, then verify that the save game can be loaded.\n+1. Network: a custom variant of RMI (remote method invocation) is used. To test\n+this, start a game without any changes, host. Then in another instance, make\n+changes, launch, and connect to the host and play the game through to a combat round.\n+That should test most functionality to verify network compatibility\n+1. Map XML loading: most of this is now explicit and is less brittle. After making updates,\n+load several maps to verify that map XML 'attachments' can be mapped to game code without\n+problems.\n+\n+# Submitting a PR and Code Review\n+- See [local_build_and_testing.md](local_build_and_testing.md) for how to\n+run verification and tests locally.\n+- Typically most PRs will not be reviewed until they pass the travis CI build.\n+ Comment in your PR if you wish for a preview review to be done to get high level feedback.\n+- UI changes should ideally include screenshots, this helps the larger community preview\n+the changes, lots of non-developers are TripleA experts and can use this to provide helpful feedback.\n+The screenshots help technical reviewers know what has been changed.\n+- Favor adding automated testing, it's a key missing component to TripleA, getting our test\n+coverage up is critical for us to move quickly in TripleA, and we are a long ways away and have\n+too much to do and spend too much time on overhead and manual testing.\n+- Keep changes focused, try to have one purpose behind any PR. For example split bug fixes from refactoring\n+- Favor PRs that are short and easy to review, under two hundred lines\n+- PRs should not stay open for a long time, if they are not merge-ready, or will not be within a few\n+days, close and re-open them when they are ready.\n+\n+### PR Merge Guidelines\n+At least one code reviewer must:\n+- try out any functional changes\n+- do a thorough code check\n+Before merge:", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "c7c0831a27c6160500b0ae08d49ca497440fa8f1"}, "originalPosition": 79}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDkyMjA5MTY5", "url": "https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/pull/7715#pullrequestreview-492209169", "createdAt": "2020-09-20T17:23:35Z", "commit": {"oid": "c7c0831a27c6160500b0ae08d49ca497440fa8f1"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wOS0yMFQxNzoyMzozNVrOHU7xjQ==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wOS0yMFQxNzoyMzozNVrOHU7xjQ==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5MTcxMjkwOQ==", "bodyText": "Codacy found an issue: [list-item-spacing] Missing new line after list item", "url": "https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/pull/7715#discussion_r491712909", "createdAt": "2020-09-20T17:23:35Z", "author": {"login": "DanVanAtta"}, "path": ".github/CONTRIBUTING.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -1,17 +1,67 @@\n-## General\n-We are all just humans and we all make mistakes, but please be polite in conversations, and follow the golden rule.\n-\n-## Pull Requests\n-We appreciate every new developer who wants to contribute to the TripleA project.\n-If you want to create a Pull Request, please make sure your PR matches our requirements:\n- 1.
