Strictly speaking, one may argue that, in the original document, they were no longer deprecated in the final TripleA version, since they went from being deprecated to being completely removed (something that I understant now has been effectively reverted, going back to the 1.8.0.9 situation).", "url": "https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/pull/7662#discussion_r489815941", "createdAt": "2020-09-16T23:53:58Z", "author": {"login": "Cernelius"}, "path": "docs/map-making/how-to-upgrade-legacy-map-features.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -41,43 +32,20 @@ Within every game (XML) file, inside the \"games\" folder inside the main folder o\n - `=\"Battleships repair at beginning of round\"` >> `=\"Units Repair Hits Start Turn\"`\n - `=\"Naval Bombard Casualties Return Fire Restricted\"` >> `=\"Naval Bombard Casualties Return Fire\"`\n - `=\"SBR Affects Unit Production\"` >> `=\"Damage From Bombing Done To Units Instead Of Territories\"`\n-\n-### Changes of game (XML) file special code for the above items:\n-\n-_(these are cases of advanced coding, so you probably don't have these within the game file)_\n-\n-Within every game file (XML), inside the \"games\" folder inside the main folder of the map, change:\n-\n - `=\"conditionType\" count=\"XOR\"` >> `=\"conditionType\" count=\"1\"`\n - `=\"conditionType\" count=\"-reset-XOR\"` >> `=\"conditionType\" count=\"-reset-1\"`\n-\n-### Changes of already deprecated game (XML) file items:\n-\n-_(these items were already deprecated, so you shouldn't have had these within the game file already)_\n-\n-Within every game (XML) file, inside the \"games\" folder inside the main folder of the map, change:\n-\n-- `=\"isTwoHit\" value=\"true\"` >> `=\"hitPoints\" value=\"2\"`\n-- `=\"isTwoHit\" value=\"false\"` >> `=\"hitPoints\" value=\"1\"`\n-- `=\"occupiedTerrOf\"` >> `=\"originalOwner\"`\n-- `=\"victoryCity\" value=\"true\"` >> `=\"victoryCity\" value=\"1\"`\n-- `=\"victoryCity\" value=\"false\"` >> `=\"victoryCity\" value=\"0\"`\n-\n-### Changes of game (XML) file special code for the above items:\n-\n-_(these are cases of advanced coding, so you probably don't have these within the game file)_\n-\n-Within every game file (XML), inside the \"games\" folder inside the main folder of the map, change:\n-\n - `=\"isTwoHit\" count=\"true\"` >> `=\"hitPoints\" count=\"2\"`\n+- `=\"isTwoHit\" value=\"false\"` >> `=\"hitPoints\" value=\"1\"`\n - `=\"isTwoHit\" count=\"-reset-true\"` >> `=\"hitPoints\" count=\"-reset-2\"`\n - `=\"isTwoHit\" count=\"false\"` >> `=\"hitPoints\" count=\"1\"`\n - `=\"isTwoHit\" count=\"-reset-false\"` >> `=\"hitPoints\" count=\"-reset-1\"`\n+- `=\"occupiedTerrOf\"` >> `=\"originalOwner\"`\n - `=\"victoryCity\" count=\"true\"` >> `=\"victoryCity\" count=\"1\"`\n - `=\"victoryCity\" count=\"-reset-true\"` >> `=\"victoryCity\" count=\"-reset-1\"`\n - `=\"victoryCity\" count=\"false\"` >> `=\"victoryCity\" count=\"0\"`\n - `=\"victoryCity\" count=\"-reset-false\"` >> `=\"victoryCity\" count=\"-reset-0\"`\n \n+\n ### XML Deletions\n \n _(these items were already deprecated and did nothing)_", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4OTcyNDk4MQ=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "3a0fa4dbef293686e1604f34ee309ada8896a08e"}, "originalPosition": 91}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMzA2NDI4MTk5OnYy", "diffSide": "LEFT", "path": "docs/map-making/how-to-upgrade-legacy-map-features.md", "isResolved": false, "comments": {"totalCount": 3, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wOS0xNlQyMDo0MTo0M1rOHTDeCA==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wOS0xNlQyMzozNzowNVrOHTHsSQ==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4OTc0MTgzMg==", "bodyText": "This whole section has been removed without a valid substutite, so it is now a missing item, thus needs to be added back.
