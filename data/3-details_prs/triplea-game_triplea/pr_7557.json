Rather than having\na partially populated game data, we'll skip the game data assembly\nand just return parts of the XML directly. Any consumers of this\nwill only get data fields and will *not* get a partial game data\nobject.\n\ncommit 1d2b96a\nUse XML-Scanner in game-core to do shallow-parsing\n\nThe shallow-parsing is so we can find the game name of a XML file\nwithout doing the full parse of XML and without assembling\na GameData object.\n\nThis update changes shallow parsing to use a new XML Scanner\n(in xml-reader) that is based on StAX.\n\nThe performance change for Bot startup speed is negligable, but\nfor listing game files (clicking 'select map' button), there\nis a pretty nice speedup and XML shallow parsing time is\nreduced from on average 80ms (per XML) to 0.5ms\n\nForward-looking, future work will incorporate the XML body-text\nscanner to read game-notes in a quick manner to speed up the listing\nof game notes in the 'select game' screen.\n\n\nTesting\n\nlaunched a local game and verified behavior when clicking 'select map'. Also did some timing there, shallow parsing is down to 0.5ms from (on average) 80ms per XML.\nlaunched a local bot and connected to it, verified map selection looked good.\n\n\nScreens Shots\n\nAdditional Notes to Reviewer\n\nRelease Note", "createdAt": "2020-09-06T02:38:22Z", "url": "https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/pull/7557", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "6890a7a463bf139fe111a7ece23efa4324ef0193"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-09-07T01:38:46Z", "author": {"login": "DanVanAtta"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 6, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABdGFIatAFqTQ4MzEwNjY4NA==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABdGFXaqgH2gAyNDgwNjM1MjMxOjBhMDRkYTE2OTA3ZGExZjE3NGJmNDIzM2I4NGFjMGU5MDFlOWFiMTg=", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDgzMTA2Njg0", "url": "https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/pull/7557#pullrequestreview-483106684", "createdAt": "2020-09-06T02:39:29Z", "commit": {"oid": "16f4d41e87f8edf140ffb46f92484fc5741ae554"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 3, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wOS0wNlQwMjozOToyOVrOHNlx6Q==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wOS0wNlQwMjozOTozMFrOHNlx6w==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4NDAxMjUyMQ==", "bodyText": "Method scanForAttributeValue has a Cognitive Complexity of 10 (exceeds 7 allowed).
