To temporarily reenable support, set the guava.gwt.emergency_reenable_rpc system property to true. (5214a10b1e)\n\nThis is the only breaking change in this release, and it affects only users of the guava-gwt artifact, not people who use only the guava artifact. This release contains no changes that break binary compatibility for any users.\n\n\nAPI documentation for Guava classes is now easier to reach. For example, for ImmutableList, visit guava.dev/ImmutableList. Also, more easily access the index at guava.dev/api.\ncollect: Annotated FluentIterable.from(FluentIterable) with @DoNotCall. (b1c77b7df3)\ncollect: Made ceiling, floor, headSet(E, boolean), and tailSet(E, boolean) methods available in the GWT-emulated ImmutableSortedSet. (7e0fe90ca8, 5f2fbf27b2)\ngraph: Made it possible to set a stable incident edge order by calling the newly added method [Value]Graph.Builder.incidentEdgeOrder(ElementOrder.stable()). (70164025a8)\ngraph: Added incidentEdgeOrder() to the [Value]Graph interfaces. (cde576ec00)\nutil.concurrent: Added Duration-based default methods to ListeningScheduledExecutorService. (931e83f969)\nutil.concurrent: Added immediateVoidFuture. (9f3bae5853)\nutil.concurrent: Removed @Beta from Service and related classes. (dc46627fea)\nutil.concurrent: Deprecated the 1-arg overload of ServiceManager.addListener. (86e3620125)\nutil.concurrent: Changed the return type of ServiceManager.servicesByState() to ImmutableSetMultimap (but also retained a method with the old signature for binary compatibility). (31999ae6f5)\nutil.concurrent: Made it safe to load the AbstractFuture class from a ForkJoinPool thread under a security manager.
