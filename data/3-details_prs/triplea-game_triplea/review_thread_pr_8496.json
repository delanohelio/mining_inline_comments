It could make more sense to instead to inline this match altogether. In that case we'd want the object invoking this to not only have the match inlined, but also for that object to keep a reference to relationship tracker and not GameData.\nI think any one-line matcher needs to be really questions. The Matches API is a DIY java8 Predicate that was created before Java8 came out. We are now re-inventing a java built-in here.\nEG:\n.filter(unitIsEnemyOf(relationshipTracker, player))\n\nvs:\n.filter(unit -> relationshipTracker.isAtWar(unit.getOwner(), player))\n\nI think we need to consider how we are going to update Matches, whether it really is a nicer API for such cases.
