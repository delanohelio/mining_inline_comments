{"data": {"repository": {"pullRequest": {"id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDE4NDQzOTIw", "number": 6315, "title": "[go-experimental] Ensure enum deserialization checks enum values", "bodyText": "This new unmarshalling method for enums ensures that unmarshalling fails if the value is not in the enumeration choices. As the enum type is just a type alias in go, technically any value of the base type can actually be assigned to it - this patch prevents that at least on unmarshalling.\nThis allows to properly deserialize oneOf members that have a common field that has specific distinct choices for each of the members. For example:\n\nA and B are members of oneOf and both have a foo\nFor A, foo is an enum with allowed choices a, A\nFor B, foo is an enum with allowed choices b, B\nThe rest of the fields is potentially the same.\n\nHaving this new unmarshalling method ensures that entity with foo: b can't get deserialized as A, but only as B, hence the oneOf deserialization works properly.\n\nPR checklist\n\n Read the contribution guidelines.\n If contributing template-only or documentation-only changes which will change sample output, build the project before.\n Run the shell script(s) under ./bin/ (or Windows batch scripts under.\\bin\\windows) to update Petstore samples related to your fix. This is important, as CI jobs will verify all generator outputs of your HEAD commit, and these must match the expectations made by your contribution. You only need to run ./bin/{LANG}-petstore.sh, ./bin/openapi3/{LANG}-petstore.sh if updating the code or mustache templates for a language ({LANG}) (e.g. php, ruby, python, etc).\n File the PR against the correct branch: master, 4.3.x, 5.0.x. Default: master.\n Copy the technical committee to review the pull request if your PR is targeting a particular programming language.\n\n@antihax (2017/11) @bvwells (2017/12) @grokify (2018/07) @kemokemo (2018/09) @bkabrda (2019/07)", "createdAt": "2020-05-15T08:14:26Z", "url": "https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/pull/6315", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "634291f4b8f65132a1ef52bc0d3b86c0506f9b5f"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-05-18T08:42:41Z", "author": {"login": "bkabrda"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABchdgADgH2gAyNDE4NDQzOTIwOjcwM2Y1Y2EwOWI5MTEwNjM2YWI0Yjg3NWI1MjhlNTI4YTNiZDcwNTQ=", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABcibyiugFqTQxMzM4NjUxMw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "703f5ca09b9110636ab4b875b528e528a3bd7054", "author": {"user": {"login": "bkabrda", "name": "Slavek Kabrda"}}, "url": "https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/commit/703f5ca09b9110636ab4b875b528e528a3bd7054", "committedDate": "2020-05-15T08:07:47Z", "message": "[go-experimental] Ensure enum deserialization checks enum values"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDEzMzg2NTEz", "url": "https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/pull/6315#pullrequestreview-413386513", "createdAt": "2020-05-18T08:42:08Z", "commit": {"oid": "703f5ca09b9110636ab4b875b528e528a3bd7054"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNS0xOFQwODo0MjowOFrOGWtK9A==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNS0xOFQwODo0MjowOFrOGWtK9A==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyNjQ2MTk0MA==", "bodyText": "The change looks good to me.
