This is important, as CI jobs will verify all generator outputs of your HEAD commit as it would merge with master. These must match the expectations made by your contribution. You may regenerate an individual generator by passing the relevant config(s) as an argument to the script, for example ./bin/generate-samples.sh bin/config/java*. For Windows users, please run the script in Git BASH.\n File the PR against the correct branch: master\n Copy the technical committee to review the pull request if your PR is targeting a particular programming language.\n\ncc @OpenAPITools/generator-core-team", "createdAt": "2020-07-03T02:40:13Z", "url": "https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/pull/6849", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "a97feaf533aeace3e18b8cd96087e544a46646ea"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-08-24T23:00:48Z", "author": {"login": "jimschubert"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 3, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABcxKHPkAH2gAyNDQzODIxNDQ2OmQxYThkZjBlYTRmMmI5ZGNkZTg0YmRhMTU3ZDNjZGU1NDkzZDg1ODY=", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABc7ZwtvgH2gAyNDQzODIxNDQ2OjVlNmQ5NGVmN2IyZjQ5MWFhMzM4MDQ0ZDcxYzI2NDI5OWJlZDVmYTA=", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "d1a8df0ea4f2b9dcde84bda157d3cde5493d8586", "author": {"user": {"login": "jimschubert", "name": "Jim Schubert"}}, "url": "https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/commit/d1a8df0ea4f2b9dcde84bda157d3cde5493d8586", "committedDate": "2020-07-03T02:35:20Z", "message": "[core] Add x-is-free-form vendor extension\n\nThis adds an x-is-free-form vendor extension to allow users to skip our\n\"free-form\" logic which would previously prevent object schemas with no\nproperties to be considered \"free-form\".
