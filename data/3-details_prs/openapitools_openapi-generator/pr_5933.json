That approach was not taken because of the potential for significant performance impact on very large specs, which our users are often tasked with transforming.\nThis is related to #3237, which wouldn't be a viable solution because it would remove support for OpenAPI 3.0 types and remove a handful of default configurations in the new YAML factory.\nUsers who are affected by this edge case or others resulting in the removal of quotes will be able to generate with the system property:\n-Dorg.openapitools.codegen.utils.yaml.minimize.quotes=false\n\nThis will result in quote behavior similar to the Swagger YAML 1.x/2.x implementation without removing the new expectations for OpenAPI 3.x types.\n\nPR checklist\n\n Read the contribution guidelines.\n If contributing template-only or documentation-only changes which will change sample output, build the project before.\n Run the shell script(s) under ./bin/ (or Windows batch scripts under.\\bin\\windows) to update Petstore samples related to your fix. This is important, as CI jobs will verify all generator outputs of your HEAD commit, and these must match the expectations made by your contribution. You only need to run ./bin/{LANG}-petstore.sh, ./bin/openapi3/{LANG}-petstore.sh if updating the code or mustache templates for a language ({LANG}) (e.g. php, ruby, python, etc).\n File the PR against the correct branch: master, 4.3.x, 5.0.x.
