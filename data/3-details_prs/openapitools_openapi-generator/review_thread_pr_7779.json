What they want from the generator is generating high-quality code which they can offer as \"SDKs\" for their API's users (or use themselves). The generator for group 2. is a tool, a means to an end, it's not the destination.\nThe group 3. doesn't care about the generator at all, they're primarily interested to use the code generated, they're twice removed from it, for them, the code generated is the product. The code and the docs generated should reflect that better, aligning them a bit more toward the interest of users of the code generated goes a long way.\nIt's not about \"informing the users of the package about the generator which made the package\", it's about the package itself.
