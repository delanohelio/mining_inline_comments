using the xref:STRIMZI_FULL_RECONCILIATION_INTERVAL_MS[] variable.\n+\n+= Provisioning Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)\n+\n+For the Cluster Operator to function it needs permission within the Kubernetes cluster to interact with resources such as `Kafka`, `KafkaConnect`, and so on, as well as the managed resources, such as `ConfigMaps`, `Pods`, `Deployments`, `StatefulSets` and `Services`.\n+Such permission is described in terms of Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) resources:\n+\n+* `ServiceAccount`,\n+* `Role` and `ClusterRole`,\n+* `RoleBinding` and `ClusterRoleBinding`.\n+\n+In addition to running under its own `ServiceAccount` with a `ClusterRoleBinding`, the Cluster Operator manages some RBAC resources for the components that need access to Kubernetes resources.\n+\n+Kubernetes also includes privilege escalation protections that prevent components operating under one `ServiceAccount` from granting other `ServiceAccounts` privileges that the granting `ServiceAccount` does not have.\n+Because the Cluster Operator must be able to create the `ClusterRoleBindings`, and `RoleBindings` needed by resources it manages, the Cluster Operator must also have those same privileges.\n+\n+[id='delegated-privileges-{context}']\n+== Delegated privileges\n+\n+When the Cluster Operator deploys resources for a desired `Kafka` resource it also creates `ServiceAccounts`, `RoleBindings`, and `ClusterRoleBindings`, as follows:\n+\n+* The Kafka broker pods use a `ServiceAccount` called `_cluster-name_-kafka`\n+  - When the rack feature is used, the `strimzi-_cluster-name_-kafka-init` `ClusterRoleBinding` is used to grant this `ServiceAccount` access to the nodes within the cluster via a `ClusterRole` called `strimzi-kafka-broker`\n+  - When the rack feature is not used no binding is created\n+* The ZooKeeper pods use a `ServiceAccount` called `_cluster-name_-zookeeper`\n+* The Entity Operator pod uses a `ServiceAccount` called `_cluster-name_-entity-operator`\n+    - The Topic Operator produces Kubernetes events with status information, so the `ServiceAccount` is bound to a `ClusterRole` called `strimzi-entity-operator` which grants this access via the `strimzi-entity-operator` `RoleBinding`\n+* The pods for `KafkaConnect` and `KafkaConnectS2I` resources use a `ServiceAccount` called `_cluster-name_-cluster-connect`\n+* The pods for `KafkaMirrorMaker` use a `ServiceAccount` called `_cluster-name_-mirror-maker`\n+* The pods for `KafkaBridge` use a `ServiceAccount` called
