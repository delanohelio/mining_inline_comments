This includes updates to style, grammar, terminology, and reduces a lot of repetition in the content.\nThis PR also adds documentation for configuring distributed tracing in Mirror Maker 2.0.\nSummary of changes:\n\nCreated a tracing category for the modules and assemblies related to tracing. This will make it easier for other contributors to update the content.\nSimplified the introduction (assembly-distributed-tracing.adoc) to remove a lot of repetition and introduce the concepts in a more logical order. Previously, we were explaining the same thing in two different places.\nDeleted some background information on tracing. This content was incomplete. I think it is better for users to go to the OpenTracing or Jaeger documentation to understand the detailed concepts.\nMoved the \"Outline of procedures\" nearer to the start of the section.\nDocumentation on configuring tracing in MirrorMaker2 resources.\n\nChecklist\nPlease go through this checklist and make sure all applicable tasks have been done\n\n Write tests\n Make sure all tests pass\n Update documentation\n Check RBAC rights for Kubernetes / OpenShift roles\n Try your changes from Pod inside your Kubernetes and OpenShift cluster, not just locally\n Reference relevant issue(s) and close them after merging\n Update CHANGELOG.md", "createdAt": "2020-07-13T15:37:29Z", "url": "https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/pull/3314", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "453c745ab2fcb0c04b71eef08fc6e584d59875b5"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-07-24T09:09:13Z", "author": {"login": "laidan6000"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 20, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABczkQASgH2gAyNDQ4MzM0ODcwOjk5MWQ3NjI5ZTMzYjFhMTAxMDYyMWU2MTIzNTE0MTU0YWNhODJjYWQ=", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABc3_qZtgFqTQ1NDcxMTM1OQ==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "991d7629e33b1a1010621e6123514154aca82cad", "author": {"user": null}, "url": "https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/commit/991d7629e33b1a1010621e6123514154aca82cad", "committedDate": "2020-07-10T14:10:17Z", "message": "new tracing category for modules and assemblies\n\nSigned-off-by: Daniel Laing <dlaing@redhat.com>"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "7d1a1b533163c53dec2a3b89c77abf6c8f467711", "author": {"user": null}, "url": "https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/commit/7d1a1b533163c53dec2a3b89c77abf6c8f467711", "committedDate": "2020-07-10T16:43:03Z", "message": "Applied changes from reviewers\n\nSigned-off-by: Daniel Laing <dlaing@redhat.com>"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "e0a374ad09995d663992fadf8e55964378179cf3", "author": {"user": null}, "url": "https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/commit/e0a374ad09995d663992fadf8e55964378179cf3", "committedDate": "2020-07-13T09:44:37Z", "message": "Renamed tracing overview module\n\nSigned-off-by: Daniel Laing <dlaing@redhat.com>"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "62e3de6da4332fb5fe17ceecf9d5aea1fe2b6eb2", "author": {"user": null}, "url": "https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/commit/62e3de6da4332fb5fe17ceecf9d5aea1fe2b6eb2", "committedDate": "2020-07-13T11:14:03Z", "message": "Further style edits\n\nSigned-off-by: Daniel Laing <dlaing@redhat.com>"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "79f041949c35b419fb3f0ee89676b9453b5536b2", "author": {"user": null}, "url": "https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/commit/79f041949c35b419fb3f0ee89676b9453b5536b2", "committedDate": "2020-07-13T15:15:50Z", "message": "Use lowercase for producer and consumer\n\nSigned-off-by: Daniel Laing <dlaing@redhat.com>"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDQ3ODc4Njkw", "url": "https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/pull/3314#pullrequestreview-447878690", "createdAt": "2020-07-14T08:02:41Z", "commit": {"oid": "79f041949c35b419fb3f0ee89676b9453b5536b2"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNy0xNFQwODowMjo0MlrOGxIwaA==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNy0xNFQwODowMjo0MlrOGxIwaA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ1NDE3Njg3Mg==", "bodyText": "I wonder if this note should be introduced earlier on in the How Strimzi Supports Tracing?", "url": "https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/pull/3314#discussion_r454176872", "createdAt": "2020-07-14T08:02:42Z", "author": {"login": "PaulRMellor"}, "path": "documentation/assemblies/tracing/assembly-distributed-tracing.adoc", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,61 @@\n+// This assembly is included in the following assemblies:\n+//\n+// master.adoc\n+\n+[id='assembly-distributed-tracing-{context}']\n+= Distributed tracing\n+\n+Distributed tracing allows you to track the progress of transactions between applications in a distributed system.
