Optimizing throughput and latency\n+\n+Usually, the requirement of a system is to satisfy a particular throughput target for a proportion of messages within a given latency.\n+For example, targeting 500,000 messages per second with 95% of messages being acknowledged within 2 seconds.\n+\n+It\u2019s likely that the messaging semantics (message ordering and durability) of your producer are defined by the requirements for your application.\n+For instance, it\u2019s possible that you don\u2019t have the option of using `acks=0` or `acks=1` without breaking some important property or guarantee provided by your application.\n+\n+Broker restarts have a significant impact on high percentile statistics.\n+For example, over a long period the 99th percentile latency is dominated by behavior around broker restarts.\n+This is worth considering when designing benchmarks or comparing performance numbers from benchmarking with performance numbers seen in production.\n+\n+Depending on your objective, Kafka offers a number of configuration parameters and techniques for tuning producer performance for throughput and latency.\n+\n+Message batching (`linger.ms` and `batch.size`)::\n+Message batching delays sending messages in the hope that more messages destined for the same broker will be sent,\n+allowing them to be batched into a single produce request.\n+Batching is a compromise between higher latency in return for higher throughput.\n+Time-based batching is configured using `linger.ms`, and size-based batching is configured using `batch.size`.\n+\n+Compression (`compression.type`)::\n+Message compression adds latency in the producer (CPU time spent compressing the messages),\n+but makes requests (and potentially disk writes) smaller, which can increase throughput.\n+Whether compression is worthwhile, and the best compression to use, will depend on the messages being sent.\n+Compression happens on the thread which calls `KafkaProducer.send()`,\n+so if the latency of this method matters for your application you should consider using more threads.\n+\n+Pipelining (`max.in.flight.requests.per.connection`)::\n+Pipelining means sending more requests before the response to a previous request has been received.\n+In general more pipelining means better throughput, up to a threshold at which other effects,\n+such as worse batching, start to counteract the effect on throughput.\n+\n+.Lowering latency\n+\n+Producers scaled to produce a high rate of requests might cause queues in the Kafka cluster and increase latency.\n+\n+Use a buffer and add a small delay to reduce the number of requests to topics from producers that are not contributing a large number of messages.\n+You can set the delay in conjunction with a maximum batch size, so the delay only applies if the batch size is not reached earlier.\n+\n+NOTE: If the system fails, there is a risk of unsent data in the buffer being lost.\n+\n+----\n+# ...\n+linger.ms=0 <1>\n+batch.size=16384 <2>\n+buffer.memory=33554432 <3>\n+# ...\n+----\n+<1> The `linger` property adds a delay in milliseconds so that larger batches of messages are accumulated and sent in a request. The defaullt is `0'.`\n+<2> If a maximum `batch.size` in bytes is used, a request is sent when the maximum is reached, or messages have been queued for longer than `linger.ms` (whichever comes sooner).", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "e3bed0ace8562c56898b2a5714971040a9b22e35"}, "originalPosition": 181}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDYyNDkzMDk4", "url": "https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/pull/3457#pullrequestreview-462493098", "createdAt": "2020-08-06T12:59:33Z", "commit": {"oid": "e3bed0ace8562c56898b2a5714971040a9b22e35"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 14, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wOC0wNlQxMjo1OTozNFrOG8yYTQ==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wOC0wNlQxMzo0NTozNFrOG80N9A==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2NjM5MzE2NQ==", "bodyText": "I think the problem is in \"always mentioned when you talk about messages order in Kafka\".

using an external mapping of topic partition names to transactional ids,\n+or by computing the transactional id from the topic partition names using a function that avoids collisions.\n+\n+== Optimizing throughput and latency\n+\n+Usually, the requirement of a system is to satisfy a particular throughput target for a proportion of messages within a given latency.\n+For example, targeting 500,000 messages per second with 95% of messages being acknowledged within 2 seconds.\n+\n+It\u2019s likely that the messaging semantics (message ordering and durability) of your producer are defined by the requirements for your application.\n+For instance, it\u2019s possible that you don\u2019t have the option of using `acks=0` or `acks=1` without breaking some important property or guarantee provided by your application.\n+\n+Broker restarts have a significant impact on high percentile statistics.\n+For example, over a long period the 99th percentile latency is dominated by behavior around broker restarts.\n+This is worth considering when designing benchmarks or comparing performance numbers from benchmarking with performance numbers seen in production.\n+\n+Depending on your objective, Kafka offers a number of configuration parameters and techniques for tuning producer performance for throughput and latency.\n+\n+Message batching (`linger.ms` and `batch.size`)::\n+Message batching delays sending messages in the hope that more messages destined for the same broker will be sent,\n+allowing them to be batched into a single produce request.\n+Batching is a compromise between higher latency in return for higher throughput.\n+Time-based batching is configured using `linger.ms`, and size-based batching is configured using `batch.size`.\n+\n+Compression (`compression.type`)::\n+Message compression adds latency in the producer (CPU time spent compressing the messages),\n+but makes requests (and potentially disk writes) smaller, which can increase throughput.\n+Whether compression is worthwhile, and the best compression to use, will depend on the messages being sent.\n+Compression happens on the thread which calls `KafkaProducer.send()`,\n+so if the latency of this method matters for your application you should consider using more threads.\n+\n+Pipelining (`max.in.flight.requests.per.connection`)::\n+Pipelining means sending more requests before the response to a previous request has been received.\n+In general more pipelining means better throughput, up to a threshold at which other effects,\n+such as worse batching, start to counteract the effect on throughput.\n+\n+.Lowering latency\n+\n+When your application calls `KafkaProducer.send()` the messages are:\n+\n+* Processed by any interceptors\n+* Serialized\n+* Assigned to a partition\n+* Compressed\n+* Added to a batch of messages in a per-partition queue\n+\n+At which point the `send()` method returns.\n+So the time `send()` is blocked is determined by:\n+\n+* The time spent in the interceptors, serializers and partitioner\n+* The compression algorithm used\n+* The time spent waiting for a buffer to use for compression\n+\n+Batches will remain in the queue until one of the following occurs:\n+\n+* The batch is full (according to `batch.size`)\n+* The delay introduced by `linger.ms` has passed\n+* The sender is about to send message batches for other partitions to the same broker, and it is possible to add this batch too\n+* The producer is being flushed or closed\n+\n+Look at the configuration for batching and buffering to mitigate the impact of
