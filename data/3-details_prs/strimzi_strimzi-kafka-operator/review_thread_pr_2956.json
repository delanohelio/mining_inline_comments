Cruise Control has configurations for link:#hard-soft-goals[hard] optimization goals that must be satisfied, as well as link:#master-goals[master], link:#default-goals[default], and link:#user-provided-goals[user-provided] optimization goals.\n+\n+The following sections describe each goal configuration in more detail.\n+\n+[id=\"hard-soft-goals\"]\n+[discrete]\n+=== Hard goals and soft goals\n+\n+_Hard goals_ are goals that _must_ be satisfied in optimization proposals. \n+Goals that are not hard goals are known as _soft goals_, and might not be satisfied by optimization proposals. \n+You can think of soft goals as _best effort_ goals: they do _not_ need to be satisfied in optimization proposals, but are included in optimization calculations.\n+An optimization proposal that violates one or more soft goals, but satisfies all hard goals, is valid.\n+\n+Cruise control will calculate optimization proposals that satisfy all the hard goals and as many soft goals as possible (in their priority order). \n+An optimization proposal that does _not_ satisfy all the hard goals is rejected by Cruise Control and not sent to the user.\n+\n+NOTE: For example, you might have a soft goal to distribute a topic's replicas evenly across the cluster (the topic replica distribution goal). \n+Cruise Control will ignore this goal if doing so enables all the configured hard goals to be met.\n+\n+In Cruise Control, six of the link:#master-goals[master optimization goals] are preset as hard goals:\n+\n+[source]\n+RackAwareGoal; ReplicaCapacityGoal; DiskCapacityGoal; NetworkInboundCapacityGoal; NetworkOutboundCapacityGoal; CpuCapacityGoal\n+\n+Hard goals are controlled in the Cruise Control deployment configuration, by editing the `hard.goals` property in `Kafka.spec.cruiseControl.config`.\n+\n+* To inherit the six preset hard goals from Cruise Control, do not specify the `hard.goals` property in `Kafka.spec.cruiseControl.config`\n+\n+* To change the preset hard goals, specify the desired goals in the `hard.goals` configuration option.\n+\n+Increasing the number of hard goals will reduce the likelihood of Cruise Control generating valid optimization proposals.\n+\n+NOTE: If `skipHardGoalCheck: true` is specified in the `KafkaRebalance` custom resource, Cruise Control does not check that the list of user-provided optimization goals (`goals`) contains _all_ the configured hard goals (`hard.goals`). Therefore, if some, but not all, of the user-provided optimization goals are in the `hard.goals` list, Cruise Control will still treat them as hard goals even if `skipHardGoalCheck: true` is specified.\n+\n+[id=\"master-goals\"]\n+[discrete]\n+=== Master optimization goals\n+\n+The _master optimization goals_ are available to all users.\n+Goals that are not listed in the master optimization goals are not available to use for Cruise Control operations.\n+\n+Unless you change the Cruise Control xref:proc-deploying-cruise-control-{context}[deployment configuration], {ProductName} will inherit the following master optimization goals from Cruise Control, in descending priority order:\n+\n+[source]\n+RackAwareGoal; ReplicaCapacityGoal; DiskCapacityGoal; NetworkInboundCapacityGoal; NetworkOutboundCapacityGoal; CpuCapacityGoal; ReplicaDistributionGoal; PotentialNwOutGoal; DiskUsageDistributionGoal; NetworkInboundUsageDistributionGoal; NetworkOutboundUsageDistributionGoal; CpuUsageDistributionGoal; TopicReplicaDistributionGoal; LeaderReplicaDistributionGoal; LeaderBytesInDistributionGoal; PreferredLeaderElectionGoal\n+\n+Six of these goals are preset as link:#hard-soft-goals[hard goals].\n+\n+To reduce complexity, we recommend that you use the inherited master optimization goals, unless you need to _completely_ exclude one or more goals from use in `KafkaRebalance` resources. The priority order of the master optimization goals can be modified, if desired, in the link:#default-goals[default optimization goals].\n+\n+Master optimization goals are controlled, if needed, in the Cruise Control deployment configuration: `Kafka.spec.cruiseControl.config.goals`\n+\n+* To accept the inherited master optimization goals, do not specify the `goals` property in `Kafka.spec.cruiseControl.config`.\n+\n+* If you need to modify the inherited master optimization goals, specify a list of goals in the `goals` configuration option.\n+\n+[id=\"default-goals\"]\n+[discrete]\n+=== Default optimization goals\n+\n+Cruise Control uses the _default optimization goals_ to generate the _cached optimization proposal_.\n+For more information about the cached optimization proposal, see xref:con-optimization-proposals-{context}[]. \n+\n+You can override the default optimization goals by setting link:#user-provided-goals[user-provided optimization goals] in a `KafkaRebalance` custom resource.\n+\n+Unless you change the Cruise Control xref:proc-deploying-cruise-control-{context}[deployment configuration], the default optimization goals are the same as the master optimization goals.\n+\n+* To use the master optimization goals as the default goals, do not specify the `default.goals` property in `Kafka.spec.cruiseControl.config`.\n+\n+* To modify the default optimization goals, edit the `default.goals` property in `Kafka.spec.cruiseControl.config`.\n+You must use a subset of the master optimization goals.\n+ \n+.Example `Kafka` configuration for default optimization goals\n+\n+[source,yaml,subs=\"attributes+\"]\n+----\n+apiVersion: {KafkaApiVersion}\n+kind: Kafka\n+metadata:\n+  name: my-cluster\n+spec:\n+  kafka:\n+    #
