pre-configured realms.\n+We connect to the Keycloak Admin Console and demonstrate the sections of the user interface where authorizations rules are configured.\n+We use Kafka CLI client tools with different personal and service accounts to demonstrate limited access based on the permissions granted to different accounts.\n+\n+\n+== Token Based Authorization with Keycloak Authorization Services\n+\n+Once the Kafka Broker has obtained an access token by using `oauth` authentication, it is possible to use centrally managed authorization rules to enforce access restrictions onto Kafka Clients.\n+For this, Strimzi Kafka Operator comes with `keycloak` authorization which uses Keycloak Authorization Services to centrally manage permissions.\n+\n+When using `keycloak` authorization a custom authorizer is configured on the Kafka Broker that uses Authorization Services REST endpoints available on Keycloak, which provide a list of granted permissions on resources for authenticated users.\n+The list of grants (permissions) is fetched as the first action after an authenticated session is established by the Kafka client, and then regularly refreshed in the background.\n+Grants are cached and enforced locally on the Kafka Broker for each user session to provide fast authorization decisions. Because they are refreshed, any changes to the grants on the Keycloak server are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+== Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for Keycloak\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` (for example, `default`), use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+----\n+\n+\n+== Using the Keycloak Admin Console to configure authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "16582f6c776ff4ccd240537a7873a8aae60cbda8"}, "originalPosition": 69}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NTM5ODI3NzIz", "url": "https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/pull/3989#pullrequestreview-539827723", "createdAt": "2020-11-27T09:30:24Z", "commit": {"oid": "16582f6c776ff4ccd240537a7873a8aae60cbda8"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0yN1QwOTozMDoyNFrOH63Bpg==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0yN1QwOTozMDoyNFrOH63Bpg==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUzMTQ4MDk5OA==", "bodyText": "Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n            Use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as username and password.\n          \n          \n            \n            Then we use a browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` using `admin` as username and password.", "url": "https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/pull/3989#discussion_r531480998", "createdAt": "2020-11-27T09:30:24Z", "author": {"login": "PaulRMellor"}, "path": "documentation/modules/oauth/con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-example.adoc", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,462 @@\n+// Module included in the following module:\n+//\n+// con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-authorization-services.adoc\n+\n+[id='con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-example_{context}']\n+= Example authorization rules configuration using Authorization Services\n+\n+This is an end-to-end example of using Keycloak Authorization Services to configure authorization rules for use with `keycloak` authorization in Strimzi.\n+The example starts by deploying the Keycloak server with pre-configured realms, requiring no additional configuration.\n+We deploy the Kafka cluster configured to use one of the pre-configured realms.\n+We connect to the Keycloak Admin Console and demonstrate the sections of the user interface where authorizations rules are configured.\n+We use Kafka CLI client tools with different personal and service accounts to demonstrate limited access based on the permissions granted to different accounts.\n+\n+\n+== Token Based Authorization with Keycloak Authorization Services\n+\n+Once the Kafka Broker has obtained an access token by using `oauth` authentication, it is possible to use centrally managed authorization rules to enforce access restrictions onto Kafka Clients.\n+For this, Strimzi Kafka Operator comes with `keycloak` authorization which uses Keycloak Authorization Services to centrally manage permissions.\n+\n+When using `keycloak` authorization a custom authorizer is configured on the Kafka Broker that uses Authorization Services REST endpoints available on Keycloak, which provide a list of granted permissions on resources for authenticated users.\n+The list of grants (permissions) is fetched as the first action after an authenticated session is established by the Kafka client, and then regularly refreshed in the background.\n+Grants are cached and enforced locally on the Kafka Broker for each user session to provide fast authorization decisions.

Services\n+\n+This is an end-to-end example of using Keycloak Authorization Services to configure authorization rules for use with `keycloak` authorization in Strimzi.\n+The example starts by deploying the Keycloak server with pre-configured realms, requiring no additional configuration.\n+We deploy the Kafka cluster configured to use one of the pre-configured realms.\n+We connect to the Keycloak Admin Console and demonstrate the sections of the user interface where authorizations rules are configured.\n+We use Kafka CLI client tools with different personal and service accounts to demonstrate limited access based on the permissions granted to different accounts.\n+\n+\n+== Token Based Authorization with Keycloak Authorization Services\n+\n+Once the Kafka Broker has obtained an access token by using `oauth` authentication, it is possible to use centrally managed authorization rules to enforce access restrictions onto Kafka Clients.\n+For this, Strimzi Kafka Operator comes with `keycloak` authorization which uses Keycloak Authorization Services to centrally manage permissions.\n+\n+When using `keycloak` authorization a custom authorizer is configured on the Kafka Broker that uses Authorization Services REST endpoints available on Keycloak, which provide a list of granted permissions on resources for authenticated users.\n+The list of grants (permissions) is fetched as the first action after an authenticated session is established by the Kafka client, and then regularly refreshed in the background.\n+Grants are cached and enforced locally on the Kafka Broker for each user session to provide fast authorization decisions. Because they are refreshed, any changes to the grants on the Keycloak server are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+== Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for Keycloak\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` (for example, `default`), use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+----\n+\n+\n+== Using the Keycloak Admin Console to configure authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+----\n+\n+Use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as username and password.\n+\n+The default view usually displays the *Master* realm.\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm, which you can select in the upper left corner.\n+\n+Initially the *Realm Settings* section is selected, but you can navigate to  *Groups*, *Roles*, *Clients* and *Users*.\n+\n+Under *Groups*, you can view groups to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with a name assigned. Typically, they are used to compartmentalize users into geographical, organizational or departmental units, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make a user a member of a group through a custom LDAP server admin user interface, for example, to grant them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under *Users*, when viewing all users you will see two users defined: `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under *Roles*, you can view the realm roles to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to _tag_ users with organizational roles and have the requisite permissions.\n+Roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider. If LDAP is a requirement, you could use groups instead.\n+\n+Under *Clients*, you can view the additional client configurations: `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth 2.0 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth 2.0 client authentication.\n+This client also contains the Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client from the *Authorization* tab, which becomes visible when *Authorization Enabled* is switched on from the *Settings* tab.\n+\n+\n+== Defining Authorization Services for access control\n+\n+Keycloak Authorization Services use authorization scopes, policies and permissions to define and apply access control to resources as explained in xref:keycloak_authorization_services_model_for_managing_permissions(one of the previous chapters).\n+\n+Under *Authorization* / *Permissions* of `kafka` client you can see already granted permissions that make use of *Resources* and *Policies* defined under the other tabs:\n+----\n+Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+----\n+\n+`Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster` combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy. The `Dev Team A` policy matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+`Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster` combines `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, scopes `Describe` and `Read`, and `Dev Team B` policy. The `Dev Team A` policy matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team B`. Matching users and clients have the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with `x_`.\n+\n+== Targeting permissions using group or role policies\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with service accounts enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a client ID and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use group policies, and should instead use role policies.\n+Conversely, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the group policies, rather than the role policies.\n+That is what is used for permissions that start with `ClusterManager`.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case, the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+== Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+From menu:Clients[kafka>Authorization>Settings]

con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-authorization-services.adoc\n+\n+[id='con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-example_{context}']\n+= Example authorization rules configuration using Authorization Services\n+\n+This is an end-to-end example of using Keycloak Authorization Services to configure authorization rules for use with `keycloak` authorization in Strimzi.\n+The example starts by deploying the Keycloak server with pre-configured realms, requiring no additional configuration.\n+We deploy the Kafka cluster configured to use one of the pre-configured realms.\n+We connect to the Keycloak Admin Console and demonstrate the sections of the user interface where authorizations rules are configured.\n+We use Kafka CLI client tools with different personal and service accounts to demonstrate limited access based on the permissions granted to different accounts.\n+\n+\n+== Token Based Authorization with Keycloak Authorization Services\n+\n+Once the Kafka Broker has obtained an access token by using `oauth` authentication, it is possible to use centrally managed authorization rules to enforce access restrictions onto Kafka Clients.\n+For this, Strimzi Kafka Operator comes with `keycloak` authorization which uses Keycloak Authorization Services to centrally manage permissions.\n+\n+When using `keycloak` authorization a custom authorizer is configured on the Kafka Broker that uses Authorization Services REST endpoints available on Keycloak, which provide a list of granted permissions on resources for authenticated users.\n+The list of grants (permissions) is fetched as the first action after an authenticated session is established by the Kafka client, and then regularly refreshed in the background.\n+Grants are cached and enforced locally on the Kafka Broker for each user session to provide fast authorization decisions. Because they are refreshed, any changes to the grants on the Keycloak server are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+== Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for Keycloak\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` (for example, `default`), use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+----\n+\n+\n+== Using the Keycloak Admin Console to configure authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+----\n+\n+Use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as username and password.\n+\n+The default view usually displays the *Master* realm.\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm, which you can select in the upper left corner.\n+\n+Initially the *Realm Settings* section is selected, but you can navigate to  *Groups*, *Roles*, *Clients* and *Users*.\n+\n+Under *Groups*, you can view groups to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with a name assigned. Typically, they are used to compartmentalize users into geographical, organizational or departmental units, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make a user a member of a group through a custom LDAP server admin user interface, for example, to grant them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under *Users*, when viewing all users you will see two users defined: `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under *Roles*, you can view the realm roles to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups.

Typically, they are used to compartmentalize users into geographical, organizational or departmental units, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make a user a member of a group through a custom LDAP server admin user interface, for example, to grant them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under *Users*, when viewing all users you will see two users defined: `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under *Roles*, you can view the realm roles to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to _tag_ users with organizational roles and have the requisite permissions.\n+Roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider. If LDAP is a requirement, you could use groups instead.\n+\n+Under *Clients*, you can view the additional client configurations: `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth 2.0 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth 2.0 client authentication.\n+This client also contains the Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client from the *Authorization* tab, which becomes visible when *Authorization Enabled* is switched on from the *Settings* tab.\n+\n+\n+== Defining Authorization Services for access control\n+\n+Keycloak Authorization Services use authorization scopes, policies and permissions to define and apply access control to resources as explained in xref:keycloak_authorization_services_model_for_managing_permissions(one of the previous chapters).\n+\n+Under *Authorization* / *Permissions* of `kafka` client you can see already granted permissions that make use of *Resources* and *Policies* defined under the other tabs:\n+----\n+Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+----\n+\n+`Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster` combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy. The `Dev Team A` policy matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+`Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster` combines `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, scopes `Describe` and `Read`, and `Dev Team B` policy. The `Dev Team A` policy matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team B`. Matching users and clients have the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with `x_`.\n+\n+== Targeting permissions using group or role policies\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with service accounts enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a client ID and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use group policies, and should instead use role policies.\n+Conversely, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the group policies, rather than the role policies.\n+That is what is used for permissions that start with `ClusterManager`.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case, the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+== Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+From menu:Clients[kafka>Authorization>Settings] make sure that *Decision Strategy* is set to *Affirmative*, and NOT to *Unanimous*.\n+Navigate in Keycloak to check that the expected resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions are defined.\n+\n+With the configuration in place, we can check access to Kafka by using a producer and consumer to create topics using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, a new interactive pod container is run using a Strimzi Kafka image to connect to a running Kafka broker.\n+\n+[source,shell]\n+----\n+kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never

group or role policies\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with service accounts enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a client ID and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use group policies, and should instead use role policies.\n+Conversely, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the group policies, rather than the role policies.\n+That is what is used for permissions that start with `ClusterManager`.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case, the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+== Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+From menu:Clients[kafka>Authorization>Settings]

Because they are refreshed, any changes to the grants on the Keycloak server are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+== Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for Keycloak\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` (for example, `default`), use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+----\n+\n+\n+== Using the Keycloak Admin Console to configure authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+----\n+\n+Use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as username and password.\n+\n+The default view usually displays the *Master* realm.\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm, which you can select in the upper left corner.\n+\n+Initially the *Realm Settings* section is selected, but you can navigate to  *Groups*, *Roles*, *Clients* and *Users*.\n+\n+Under *Groups*, you can view groups to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with a name assigned. Typically, they are used to compartmentalize users into geographical, organizational or departmental units, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make a user a member of a group through a custom LDAP server admin user interface, for example, to grant them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under *Users*, when viewing all users you will see two users defined: `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under *Roles*, you can view the realm roles to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to _tag_ users with organizational roles and have the requisite permissions.\n+Roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider. If LDAP is a requirement, you could use groups instead.\n+\n+Under *Clients*, you can view the additional client configurations: `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth 2.0 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth 2.0 client authentication.\n+This client also contains the Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client from the *Authorization* tab, which becomes visible when *Authorization Enabled* is switched on from the *Settings* tab.\n+\n+\n+== Defining Authorization Services for access control\n+\n+Keycloak Authorization Services use authorization scopes, policies and permissions to define and apply access control to resources as explained in xref:keycloak_authorization_services_model_for_managing_permissions(one of the previous chapters).\n+\n+Under *Authorization* / *Permissions* of `kafka` client you can see already granted permissions that make use of *Resources* and *Policies* defined under the other tabs:\n+----\n+Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+----\n+\n+`Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster` combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.

The `Dev Team A` policy matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team B`. Matching users and clients have the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with `x_`.\n+\n+== Targeting permissions using group or role policies\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with service accounts enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a client ID and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use group policies, and should instead use role

Services\n+\n+== Kafka authorization model for resources\n+\n+The link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#security_authz_primitives[Kafka authorization model] defines resource types, and the permissions available for each type.\n+When an action is performed by a Kafka client on a broker, the broker uses a configured authorizer to check permissions, depending on the action performed and the resource type.\n+\n+Kafka has five resource types for controlling access: `Topic`, `Group`, `Cluster`, `TransactionalId`, `DelegationToken`.\n+\n+Each resource type has different permissions:\n+\n+Topic:\n+\n+* `Create`\n+* `Write`\n+* `Read`\n+* `Delete`\n+* `Describe`\n+* `DescribeConfigs`\n+* `Alter`\n+* `AlterConfigs`\n+\n+Group:\n+\n+* `Read`\n+* `Describe`\n+*

permissions: _resources_, _authorization scopes_, _policies_, and _permissions_.\n+\n+Resources:: Resources are a set of resource definitions that are used to match permitted actions.\n+For example, a resource can be an individual topic, or it can be a set of all topics with names that start with the same prefix.\n+The resource definition has a set of available authorization scopes associated with it, which represent a set of all actions available on the particular resource.\n+Often, only a subset of these actions is actually permitted.\n+\n+Authorization scopes:: Authorization scopes is simply a set of all available actions on all the different resource types. When defining a new resource,  scopes are added from the set of all scopes.\n+\n+Policies:: Policies are rules that use criteria to match a list of accounts. Policies can match service accounts based on client id or roles, or user accounts based on username, groups, or roles.\n+\n+Permissions:: Permissions grant a subset of authorization scopes on a specific resource definition to a set of users.\n+\n+== Mapping Keycloak Authorization Services to Kafka Model\n+\n+Use Keycloak Authorization Services rules on the OAuth client that represents the Kafka Broker to grant Kafka permissions to users or service accounts.

Authorization Services\n+\n+This is an end-to-end example of using Keycloak Authorization Services to configure authorization rules for use with `keycloak` authorization in Strimzi.\n+The example starts by deploying the Keycloak server with pre-configured realms, requiring no additional configuration.\n+We deploy the Kafka cluster configured to use one of the pre-configured realms.\n+We connect to the Keycloak Admin Console and demonstrate the sections of the user interface where authorizations rules are configured.\n+We use Kafka CLI client tools with different personal and service accounts to demonstrate limited access based on the permissions granted to different accounts.\n+\n+\n+== Token Based Authorization with Keycloak Authorization Services\n+\n+Once the Kafka Broker has obtained an access token by using `oauth` authentication, it is possible to use centrally managed authorization rules to enforce access restrictions onto Kafka Clients.\n+For this, Strimzi Kafka Operator comes with `keycloak` authorization which uses Keycloak Authorization Services to centrally manage permissions.\n+\n+When using `keycloak` authorization a custom authorizer is configured on the Kafka Broker that uses Authorization Services REST endpoints available on Keycloak, which provide a list of granted permissions on resources for authenticated users.\n+The list of grants (permissions) is fetched as the first action after an authenticated session is established by the Kafka client, and then regularly refreshed in the background.\n+Grants are cached and enforced locally on the Kafka Broker for each user session to provide fast authorization decisions. Because they are refreshed, any changes to the grants on the Keycloak server are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+== Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for Keycloak\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` (for example, `default`), use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+----\n+\n+\n+== Using the Keycloak Admin Console to configure authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+----\n+\n+Use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as username and password.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUzMTQ4MDIyMw=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "16582f6c776ff4ccd240537a7873a8aae60cbda8"}, "originalPosition": 76}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUzMTUxMDg5Mw==", "bodyText": "Ok.

Typically they are used to geographically or organisationally compartmentalize users into organisations, organisational units, departments, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make some user a member of some group - through a custom LDAP server admin UI for example, which grants them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under `Users`, click on the `View all users` button and you will see two users defined - `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under `Roles` we can see several realm roles which can be used to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to 'tag' users as playing organisational roles and having permissions that pertain to it.\n+In Keycloak the roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider - if that is your requirement then you should use groups instead.\n+\n+Under `Clients` we can see some additional clients configured - `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth2 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth2 client authentication.\n+This client also contains Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client under `Authorization` tab.\n+This tab becomes visible when `Authorization Enabled` is turned on under the `Settings` tab.\n+\n+\n+## Authorization Services - Resources, Authorization Scopes, Policies and Permissions\n+\n+`Keycloak Authorization Services` use several concepts that together take part in defining, and applying access control to resources.\n+\n+`Resources` define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of `authorization scopes` - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+`Policies` define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, the `permissions` tie together specific `resources`, `action scopes` and `policies` to define that 'specific users U can perform certain actions A on the resource R'.\n+\n+You can read more about `Keycloak Authorization Services` on link:https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/index.html[project's web site], but note that the documentation there is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources, whereas here we're using it to protect access to Kafka.\n+\n+If we take a look under the `Resources` sub-tab of `Authorization` tab, we'll see the list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers - patterns in a specific format, that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+The format is quite simple. For example:\n+\n+- `kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*`  ... targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_'\n+\n+If `kafka-cluster:XXX` segment is not present, the specifier targets any cluster.\n+\n+- `Group:x_*` ... targets all consumer groups on any cluster with names starting with 'x_'\n+\n+The possible resource types mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model] (`Topic`, `Group`, `Cluster`, ...).\n+\n+Under `Authorization Scopes` we can see a list of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on resources of different types.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+This list mirrors Kafka permissions and should be the same for any deployment.\n+\n+There is an link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file containing the authorization scopes that can be imported, so that they do not have to be manually entered for every new `Authorization Services` enabled client.\n+In order to import `authorization-scopes.json` into a new client, first make sure the new client is `Authorization Enabled` and saved. Then, click on the `Authorization` tab and use the `Import` to import the file. Afterwards, if you select the `Authorization Scopes` you will see the loaded scopes.\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+Under the `Policies` sub-tab there are filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the Roles, or Groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be programmatically defined using JavaScript where logic can take into account the context of the client session - for example, client ip (that is client ip of the Kafka client).\n+\n+Then, finally, there is the `Permissions` sub-tab, which defines 'role bindings' where `resources`, `authorization scopes` and `policies` are tied together to apply a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Each `permission` definition can have a nice descriptive name which can make it very clear what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+    Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+    Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+## Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyOTY4NjY4Mg=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "0bab89961e4af7af74c896083be2f6d4fe0cc74f"}, "originalPosition": 162}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUzMTUxNDE0OA==", "bodyText": "Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n            User `bob` should can read from or write to any topic:\n          \n          \n            \n            User `bob` can read from or write to any topic:", "url": "https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/pull/3989#discussion_r531514148", "createdAt": "2020-11-27T10:29:53Z", "author": {"login": "mstruk"}, "path": "documentation/modules/oauth/con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-example.adoc", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,462 @@\n+// Module included in the following module:\n+//\n+// con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-authorization-services.adoc\n+\n+[id='con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-example_{context}']\n+= Example authorization rules configuration using Authorization Services\n+\n+This is an end-to-end example of using Keycloak Authorization Services to configure authorization rules for use with `keycloak` authorization in Strimzi.\n+The example starts by deploying the Keycloak server with pre-configured realms, requiring no additional configuration.\n+We deploy the Kafka cluster configured to use one of the pre-configured realms.\n+We connect to the Keycloak Admin Console and demonstrate the sections of the user interface where authorizations rules are configured.\n+We use Kafka CLI client tools with different personal and service accounts to demonstrate limited access based on the permissions granted to different accounts.\n+\n+\n+== Token Based Authorization with Keycloak Authorization Services\n+\n+Once the Kafka Broker has obtained an access token by using `oauth` authentication, it is possible to use centrally managed authorization rules to enforce access restrictions onto Kafka Clients.\n+For this, Strimzi Kafka Operator comes with `keycloak` authorization which uses Keycloak Authorization Services to centrally manage permissions.\n+\n+When using `keycloak` authorization a custom authorizer is configured on the Kafka Broker that uses Authorization Services REST endpoints available on Keycloak, which provide a list of granted permissions on resources for authenticated users.\n+The list of grants (permissions) is fetched as the first action after an authenticated session is established by the Kafka client, and then regularly refreshed in the background.\n+Grants are cached and enforced locally on the Kafka Broker for each user session to provide fast authorization decisions.

Typically, they are used to compartmentalize users into geographical, organizational or departmental units, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak, groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make a user a member of a group through a custom LDAP server admin user interface, for example, to grant them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under *Users*, you can view all defined users. For this example, `alice` and `bob` are defined. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak, users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under *Roles*, you can view the realm roles to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to _tag_ users with organizational roles and have the requisite permissions.\n+Roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider. If LDAP is a requirement, you could use groups instead.\n+\n+Under *Clients*, you can view the additional client configurations. For this eaxmple,  `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client` are configured.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth 2.0 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth 2.0 client authentication.\n+This client also contains the Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client from the *Authorization* tab, which becomes visible when *Authorization Enabled* is switched on from the *Settings* tab.\n+\n+\n+== Defining Authorization Services for access control\n+\n+Keycloak Authorization Services use authorization scopes, policies and permissions to define and apply access control to resources, as explained in xref:keycloak_authorization_services_model_for_managing_permissions[Keycloak Authorization Services model for managing permissions].\n+\n+From *Authorization* / *Permissions* you can see the granted permissions that use resources and policies defined from other *Resources* and *Policies* tabs. For example, the `kafka` client has the following permissions:\n+----\n+Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+----\n+\n+`Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster` combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy. The `Dev Team A` policy matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+`Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster` combines `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, scopes `Describe` and `Read`, and `Dev Team B` policy. The `Dev Team A` policy matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team B`. Matching users and clients have the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with `x_`.\n+\n+== Targeting permissions using group or role policies\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with service accounts enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a client ID and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use group policies, and should instead use role policies.\n+Conversely, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the group policies, rather than the role policies.\n+That is what is used for permissions that start with `ClusterManager`.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case, the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+== Authorization in action using CLI clients\n+\n+Make sure that authorization rules have been properly imported.\n+\n+From menu:Clients[kafka>Authorization>Settings] make sure that *Decision Strategy* is set to *Affirmative*, and NOT to *Unanimous*.\n+Navigate in Keycloak to check that the expected resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions are defined.\n+\n+With the configuration in place, we can check access to Kafka by using a producer and consumer to create topics using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, a new interactive pod container is run using a Strimzi Kafka image to connect to a running Kafka broker.\n+\n+[source,shell]\n+----\n+kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "147eb37597a702d2d77ee065e4bc7da8d40600ce"}, "originalPosition": 153}]}}, {"__typename": "HeadRefForcePushedEvent", "beforeCommit": {"oid": "147eb37597a702d2d77ee065e4bc7da8d40600ce", "author": {"user": {"login": "mstruk", "name": "Marko Strukelj"}}, "url": "https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/commit/147eb37597a702d2d77ee065e4bc7da8d40600ce", "committedDate": "2020-12-08T22:31:08Z", "message": "Update documentation/modules/oauth/con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-example.adoc\n\nSigned-off-by: Marko Strukelj <marko.strukelj@gmail.com>"}, "afterCommit": {"oid": "eb4ee27a918ec58e34926c6aaaf034bbf74ab422", "author": {"user": {"login": "mstruk", "name": "Marko Strukelj"}}, "url": "https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/commit/eb4ee27a918ec58e34926c6aaaf034bbf74ab422", "committedDate": "2020-12-09T15:54:43Z", "message": "Fixed by #3988\n\nSigned-off-by: Marko Strukelj <marko.strukelj@gmail.com>"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NTY0NzkyNDM3", "url": "https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/pull/3989#pullrequestreview-564792437", "createdAt": "2021-01-09T16:01:06Z", "commit": {"oid": "eb4ee27a918ec58e34926c6aaaf034bbf74ab422"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMS0wMS0wOVQxNjowMTowNlrOIQwdrQ==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMS0wMS0wOVQxNjowMToxNlrOIQwduA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU1NDQ0MjE1Nw==", "bodyText": "@mstruk Can you look at this so that we can merge this?", "url": "https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/pull/3989#discussion_r554442157", "createdAt": "2021-01-09T16:01:06Z", "author": {"login": "scholzj"}, "path": "documentation/modules/oauth/con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-example.adoc", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,461 @@\n+// Module included in the following module:\n+//\n+// con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-authorization-services.adoc\n+\n+[id='con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-example_{context}']\n+= Example authorization rules configuration using Authorization Services\n+\n+This is an end-to-end example of using Keycloak Authorization Services to configure authorization rules for use with `keycloak` authorization in Strimzi.\n+The example starts by deploying the Keycloak server with pre-configured realms, requiring no additional configuration.\n+We deploy the Kafka cluster configured to use one of the pre-configured realms.\n+We then connect to the Keycloak Admin Console and demonstrate the sections of the user interface where authorizations rules are configured.\n+We use Kafka CLI client tools with different personal and service accounts to demonstrate limited access based on the permissions granted to different accounts.\n+\n+\n+== Token-based authorization with Keycloak Authorization Services\n+\n+Once the Kafka Broker has obtained an access token by using `oauth` authentication, it is possible to use centrally managed authorization rules to enforce access restrictions onto Kafka Clients.\n+For this, Strimzi Kafka Operator comes with `keycloak` authorization which uses Keycloak Authorization Services to centrally manage permissions.\n+\n+When using `keycloak` authorization, a custom authorizer is configured on the Kafka broker that uses Authorization Services REST endpoints available on Keycloak, which provide a list of granted permissions on resources for authenticated users.\n+The list of grants (permissions) is fetched as the first action after an authenticated session is established by the Kafka client, and then regularly refreshed in the background.\n+Grants are cached and enforced locally on the Kafka broker for each user session to provide fast authorization decisions.

Typically, they are used to compartmentalize users into geographical, organizational or departmental units, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak, groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make a user a member of a group through a custom LDAP server admin user interface, for example, to grant them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under *Users*, you can view all defined users. For this example, `alice` and `bob` are defined. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak, users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under *Roles*, you can view the realm roles to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to _tag_ users with organizational roles and have the requisite permissions.\n+Roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider. If LDAP is a requirement, you could use groups instead.\n+\n+Under *Clients*, you can view the additional client configurations. For this eaxmple,  `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client` are configured.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth 2.0 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth 2.0 client authentication.\n+This client also contains the Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client from the *Authorization* tab, which becomes visible when *Authorization Enabled* is switched on from the *Settings* tab.\n+\n+\n+== Defining Authorization Services for access control\n+\n+Keycloak Authorization Services use authorization scopes, policies and permissions to define and apply access control to resources, as explained in xref:keycloak_authorization_services_model_for_managing_permissions[Keycloak Authorization Services model for managing permissions].\n+\n+From *Authorization* / *Permissions* you can see the granted permissions that use resources and policies defined from other *Resources* and *Policies* tabs. For example, the `kafka` client has the following permissions:\n+----\n+Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+----\n+\n+`Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster` combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy. The `Dev Team A` policy matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+`Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster` combines `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, scopes `Describe` and `Read`, and `Dev Team B` policy. The `Dev Team A` policy matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team B`. Matching users and clients have the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with `x_`.\n+\n+== Targeting permissions using group or role policies\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with service accounts enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a client ID and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use group policies, and should instead use role policies.\n+Conversely, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the group policies, rather than the role policies.\n+That is what is used for permissions that start with `ClusterManager`.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case, the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+== Authorization in action using CLI clients\n+\n+Make sure that authorization rules have been properly imported.\n+\n+From menu:Clients[kafka>Authorization>Settings] make sure that *Decision Strategy* is set to *Affirmative*, and NOT to *Unanimous*.\n+Navigate in Keycloak to check that the expected resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions are defined.\n+\n+With the configuration in place, we can check access to Kafka by using a producer and consumer to create topics using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, a new interactive pod container is run using a Strimzi Kafka image to connect to a running Kafka broker.\n+\n+[source,shell]\n+----\n+kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUzOTIyMjYxMw=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "147eb37597a702d2d77ee065e4bc7da8d40600ce"}, "originalPosition": 153}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU1NDQ0MjE2OA==", "bodyText": "@mstruk Can you look at this so that we can merge this?", "url": "https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/pull/3989#discussion_r554442168", "createdAt": "2021-01-09T16:01:16Z", "author": {"login": "scholzj"}, "path": "documentation/modules/oauth/con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-example.adoc", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,461 @@\n+// Module included in the following module:\n+//\n+// con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-authorization-services.adoc\n+\n+[id='con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-example_{context}']\n+= Example authorization rules configuration using Authorization Services\n+\n+This is an end-to-end example of using Keycloak Authorization Services to configure authorization rules for use with `keycloak` authorization in Strimzi.\n+The example starts by deploying the Keycloak server with pre-configured realms, requiring no additional configuration.\n+We deploy the Kafka cluster configured to use one of the pre-configured realms.\n+We then connect to the Keycloak Admin Console and demonstrate the sections of the user interface where authorizations rules are configured.\n+We use Kafka CLI client tools with different personal and service accounts to demonstrate limited access based on the permissions granted to different accounts.\n+\n+\n+== Token-based authorization with Keycloak Authorization Services\n+\n+Once the Kafka Broker has obtained an access token by using `oauth` authentication, it is possible to use centrally managed authorization rules to enforce access restrictions onto Kafka Clients.\n+For this, Strimzi Kafka Operator comes with `keycloak` authorization which uses Keycloak Authorization Services to centrally manage permissions.\n+\n+When using `keycloak` authorization, a custom authorizer is configured on the Kafka broker that uses Authorization Services REST endpoints available on Keycloak, which provide a list of granted permissions on resources for authenticated users.\n+The list of grants (permissions) is fetched as the first action after an authenticated session is established by the Kafka client, and then regularly refreshed in the background.\n+Grants are cached and enforced locally on the Kafka broker for each user session to provide fast authorization decisions.

Typically they are used to geographically or organisationally compartmentalize users into organisations, organisational units, departments, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make some user a member of some group - through a custom LDAP server admin UI for example, which grants them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under `Users`, click on the `View all users` button and you will see two users defined - `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under `Roles` we can see several realm roles which can be used to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups.

When defining a new resource,  scopes are added from the set of all scopes.\n+\n+Policies:: Policies are rules that use criteria to match a list of accounts. Policies can match service accounts based on client id or roles, or user accounts based on username, groups, or roles.\n+\n+Permissions:: Permissions grant a subset of authorization scopes on a specific resource definition to a set of users.\n+\n+== Mapping Keycloak Authorization Services to Kafka Model\n+\n+Use Keycloak Authorization Services rules on the OAuth client that represents the Kafka Broker to grant Kafka permissions to users or service accounts. Typically, the OAuth client has `kafka` as its client id.\n+\n+The OAuth 2.0 client definition must have the _Authorization Enabled_ option activated.\n+\n+All permissions exist within the scope of this OAuth 2.0 client, which means that if you have different Kafka clusters configured with different OAuth 2.0 client IDs they would each have a separate set of permissions even though they are part of the same realm.\n+\n+When the Kafka client use the _SASL OAUTHBEARER_ mechanism, the Keycloak authorizer (`KeycloakRBACAuthorizer`) retrieves the list of grants for the current session from the Keycloak server using the access token of the current session.\n+This list of grants is the result of evaluating the Keycloak Authorization Services policies and permissions.\n+\n+.Introducing authorization scopes\n+\n+Typically, an initial configuration involves uploading the authorization scopes to create a list of all the possible actions that can be performed on all the Kafka resource types.\n+This step is performed only once, before defining any permissions. Alternatively, you can add authorization scopes manually.\n+\n+The authorization scopes should contain all the possible Kafka permissions regardless of the resource type:\n+\n+* `Create`\n+* `Write`\n+* `Read`\n+* `Delete`\n+* `Describe`\n+* `Alter`\n+* `DescribeConfig`\n+* `AlterConfig`\n+* `ClusterAction`\n+* `IdempotentWrite`\n+\n+.Defining resource patterns for permission checks\n+\n+The resources use pattern names for pattern matching against the targeted resources when performing permission checks.\n+\n+The general pattern is as follows: `RESOURCE_TYPE:NAME_PATTERN`\n+\n+The resource types mirror the Kafka authorization model.\n+The pattern allows for the two matching options: exact matching (when the pattern does not end with `\\*`), and prefix matching (when the pattern ends with `*`).\n+\n+.Example patterns for resources\n+    Topic:my-topic\n+    Topic:orders-*\n+    Group:orders-*\n+    Cluster:*\n+\n+In addition, the general pattern can be prefixed by `kafka-cluster:CLUSTER_NAME` followed by a comma, where the cluster name refers to the `metadata.name` in the Kafka custom resource.\n+\n+.Example patterns for resources with cluster prefix\n+    kafka-cluster:my-cluster,Topic:*\n+    kafka-cluster:*,Group:b_*\n+\n+When the `kafka-cluster` prefix is not present it is assumed to be `kafka-cluster:*`.\n+\n+When defining a resource, you can associate a list of possible authorization scopes relevant to the resource.\n+Set whatever actions make sense for the targeted resource type.\n+\n+While you may add any authorization scope to any resource, only the scopes supported by the resource type are considered for access control.\n+\n+.Policies\n+\n+Policies are used to target permissions to one or more accounts.\n+Targeting can refer to:\n+* Specific user or service accounts\n+* Realm roles or client roles\n+* User groups\n+* JS rule to match a client IP address\n+\n+A policy is given a unique name, and can be reused to target multiple permissions to multiple resources.\n+\n+.Defining permissions based on scopes, resources and policies \n+\n+Use fine-grained permissions to pull together the policies, resources, and authorization scopes that grant access to users.\n+\n+\n+The name of the each permission should should clearly define what permissions it grants to which users.\n+\n+For more information on how to configure permissions through Keycloak Authorization Services, see xref:con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-example_str[the authorization example].\n+\n+\n+== Example permissions required for operations on Kafka\n+\n+The following  examples demonstrate the permissions required for performing common operations on Kafka.\n+\n+.Creating a topic\n+\n+To create a topic the `Create` permission is required for the specific topic or `Cluster:kafka-cluster`.\n+\n+.Displaying the topic info\n+\n+To display the info on the topic the `Describe` permission is required for the specific topic.\n+\n+.Producing to the topic\n+\n+To produce to the topic the user needs `Describe` and `Write` permissions on the topic.\n+If topic has not yet been created, and autocreation is enabled, the permissions to create the topic are required.\n+\n+.Consuming from the topic\n+\n+To consume from the topic the user needs `Describe` and `Read` permissions on the topic.\n+Consuming from the topic normally relies on storing the consumer offsets in a consumer group.\n+That requires additional `Describe` and `Read` permissions on the consumer group.\n+\n+Two `resources` are needed for matching.

Typically they are used to geographically or organisationally compartmentalize users into organisations, organisational units, departments, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make some user a member of some group - through a custom LDAP server admin UI for example, which grants them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under `Users`, click on the `View all users` button and you will see two users defined - `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under `Roles` we can see several realm roles which can be used to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups.

Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, the `permissions` tie together specific `resources`, `action scopes` and `policies` to define that 'specific users U can perform certain actions A on the resource R'.\n+\n+You can read more about `Keycloak Authorization Services` on link:https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/index.html[project's web site], but note that the documentation there is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources, whereas here we're using it to protect access to Kafka.\n+\n+If we take a look under the `Resources` sub-tab of `Authorization` tab, we'll see the list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers - patterns in a specific format, that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+The format is quite simple. For example:\n+\n+- `kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*`  ... targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_'\n+\n+If `kafka-cluster:XXX` segment is not present, the specifier targets any cluster.\n+\n+- `Group:x_*` ... targets all consumer groups on any cluster with names starting with 'x_'\n+\n+The possible resource types mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model] (`Topic`, `Group`, `Cluster`, ...).\n+\n+Under `Authorization Scopes` we can see a list of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on resources of different types.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+This list mirrors Kafka permissions and should be the same for any deployment.\n+\n+There is an link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file containing the authorization scopes that can be imported, so that they do not have to be manually entered for every new `Authorization Services` enabled client.\n+In order to import `authorization-scopes.json` into a new client, first make sure the new client is `Authorization Enabled` and saved.

in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+## Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "0bab89961e4af7af74c896083be2f6d4fe0cc74f"}, "originalPosition": 159}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NTM3NjUzMzQ1", "url": "https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/pull/3989#pullrequestreview-537653345", "createdAt": "2020-11-24T15:52:15Z", "commit": {"oid": "0bab89961e4af7af74c896083be2f6d4fe0cc74f"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0yNFQxNTo1MjoxNVrOH5IcuA==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0yNFQxNTo1MjoxNVrOH5IcuA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyOTY2OTMwNA==", "bodyText": "Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n            If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n          \n          \n            \n            If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n          \n          \n            \n            \n          \n          \n            \n            Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users -

Typically they are used to geographically or organisationally compartmentalize users into organisations, organisational units, departments, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make some user a member of some group - through a custom LDAP server admin UI for example, which grants them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under `Users`, click on the `View all users` button and you will see two users defined - `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under `Roles` we can see several realm roles which can be used to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups.

Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, the `permissions` tie together specific `resources`, `action scopes` and `policies` to define that 'specific users U can perform certain actions A on the resource R'.\n+\n+You can read more about `Keycloak Authorization Services` on link:https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/index.html[project's web site], but note that the documentation there is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources, whereas here we're using it to protect access to Kafka.\n+\n+If we take a look under the `Resources` sub-tab of `Authorization` tab, we'll see the list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers - patterns in a specific format, that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+The format is quite simple. For example:\n+\n+- `kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*`  ... targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_'\n+\n+If `kafka-cluster:XXX` segment is not present, the specifier targets any cluster.\n+\n+- `Group:x_*` ... targets all consumer groups on any cluster with names starting with 'x_'\n+\n+The possible resource types mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model] (`Topic`, `Group`, `Cluster`, ...).\n+\n+Under `Authorization Scopes` we can see a list of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on resources of different types.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+This list mirrors Kafka permissions and should be the same for any deployment.\n+\n+There is an link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file containing the authorization scopes that can be imported, so that they do not have to be manually entered for every new `Authorization Services` enabled client.\n+In order to import `authorization-scopes.json` into a new client, first make sure the new client is `Authorization Enabled` and saved.

Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, the `permissions` tie together specific `resources`, `action scopes` and `policies` to define that 'specific users U can perform certain actions A on the resource R'.\n+\n+You can read more about `Keycloak Authorization Services` on link:https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/index.html[project's web site], but note that the documentation there is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources, whereas here we're using it to protect access to Kafka.\n+\n+If we take a look under the `Resources` sub-tab of `Authorization` tab, we'll see the list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers - patterns in a specific format, that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+The format is quite simple. For example:\n+\n+- `kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*`  ... targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_'\n+\n+If `kafka-cluster:XXX` segment is not present, the specifier targets any cluster.\n+\n+- `Group:x_*` ... targets all consumer groups on any cluster with names starting with 'x_'\n+\n+The possible resource types mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model] (`Topic`, `Group`, `Cluster`, ...).\n+\n+Under `Authorization Scopes` we can see a list of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on resources of different types.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+This list mirrors Kafka permissions and should be the same for any deployment.\n+\n+There is an link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file containing the authorization scopes that can be imported, so that they do not have to be manually entered for every new `Authorization Services` enabled client.\n+In order to import `authorization-scopes.json` into a new client, first make sure the new client is `Authorization Enabled` and saved. Then, click on the `Authorization` tab and use the `Import` to import the file. Afterwards, if you select the `Authorization Scopes` you will see the loaded scopes.\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+Under the `Policies` sub-tab there are filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the Roles, or Groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be programmatically defined using JavaScript where logic can take into account the context of the client session -

Typically they are used to geographically or organisationally compartmentalize users into organisations, organisational units, departments, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make some user a member of some group - through a custom LDAP server admin UI for example, which grants them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under `Users`, click on the `View all users` button and you will see two users defined - `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under `Roles` we can see several realm roles which can be used to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to 'tag' users as playing organisational roles and having permissions that pertain to it.\n+In Keycloak the roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider - if that is your requirement then you should use groups instead.\n+\n+Under `Clients` we can see some additional clients configured - `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth2 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth2 client authentication.\n+This client also contains Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client under `Authorization` tab.\n+This tab becomes visible when `Authorization Enabled` is turned on under the `Settings` tab.\n+\n+\n+## Authorization Services - Resources, Authorization Scopes, Policies and Permissions\n+\n+`Keycloak Authorization Services` use several concepts that together take part in defining, and applying access control to resources.\n+\n+`Resources` define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of `authorization scopes` - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+`Policies` define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, the `permissions` tie together specific `resources`, `action scopes` and `policies` to define that 'specific users U can perform certain actions A on the resource R'.\n+\n+You can read more about `Keycloak Authorization Services` on link:https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/index.html[project's web site], but note that the documentation there is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources, whereas here we're using it to protect access to Kafka.\n+\n+If we take a look under the `Resources` sub-tab of `Authorization` tab, we'll see the list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers - patterns in a specific format, that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+The format is quite simple. For example:\n+\n+- `kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*`  ... targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_'\n+\n+If `kafka-cluster:XXX` segment is not present, the specifier targets any cluster.\n+\n+- `Group:x_*` ... targets all consumer groups on any cluster with names starting with 'x_'\n+\n+The possible resource types mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model] (`Topic`, `Group`, `Cluster`, ...).\n+\n+Under `Authorization Scopes` we can see a list of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on resources of different types.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+This list mirrors Kafka permissions and should be the same for any deployment.\n+\n+There is an link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file containing the authorization scopes that can be imported, so that they do not have to be manually entered for every new `Authorization Services` enabled client.\n+In order to import `authorization-scopes.json` into a new client, first make sure the new client is `Authorization Enabled` and saved. Then, click on the `Authorization` tab and use the `Import` to import the file. Afterwards, if you select the `Authorization Scopes` you will see the loaded scopes.\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+Under the `Policies` sub-tab there are filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the Roles, or Groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be programmatically defined using JavaScript where logic can take into account the context of the client session - for example, client ip (that is client ip of the Kafka client).\n+\n+Then, finally, there is the `Permissions` sub-tab, which defines 'role bindings' where `resources`, `authorization scopes` and `policies` are tied together to apply a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Each `permission` definition can have a nice descriptive name which can make it very clear what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+    Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+    Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+## Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid":

Typically they are used to geographically or organisationally compartmentalize users into organisations, organisational units, departments, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make some user a member of some group - through a custom LDAP server admin UI for example, which grants them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under `Users`, click on the `View all users` button and you will see two users defined - `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under `Roles` we can see several realm roles which can be used to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to 'tag' users as playing organisational roles and having permissions that pertain to it.\n+In Keycloak the roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider - if that is your requirement then you should use groups instead.\n+\n+Under `Clients` we can see some additional clients configured - `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth2 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth2 client authentication.\n+This client also contains Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client under `Authorization` tab.\n+This tab becomes visible when `Authorization Enabled` is turned on under the `Settings` tab.\n+\n+\n+## Authorization Services - Resources, Authorization Scopes, Policies and Permissions\n+\n+`Keycloak Authorization Services` use several concepts that together take part in defining, and applying access control to resources.\n+\n+`Resources` define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of `authorization scopes` - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+`Policies` define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, the `permissions` tie together specific `resources`, `action scopes` and `policies` to define that 'specific users U can perform certain actions A on the resource R'.\n+\n+You can read more about `Keycloak Authorization Services` on link:https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/index.html[project's web site], but note that the documentation there is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources, whereas here we're using it to protect access to Kafka.\n+\n+If we take a look under the `Resources` sub-tab of `Authorization` tab, we'll see the list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers - patterns in a specific format, that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+The format is quite simple. For example:\n+\n+- `kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*`  ... targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_'\n+\n+If `kafka-cluster:XXX` segment is not present, the specifier targets any cluster.\n+\n+- `Group:x_*` ... targets all consumer groups on any cluster with names starting with 'x_'\n+\n+The possible resource types mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model] (`Topic`, `Group`, `Cluster`, ...).\n+\n+Under `Authorization Scopes` we can see a list of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on resources of different types.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+This list mirrors Kafka permissions and should be the same for any deployment.\n+\n+There is an link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file containing the authorization scopes that can be imported, so that they do not have to be manually entered for every new `Authorization Services` enabled client.\n+In order to import `authorization-scopes.json` into a new client, first make sure the new client is `Authorization Enabled` and saved. Then, click on the `Authorization` tab and use the `Import` to import the file. Afterwards, if you select the `Authorization Scopes` you will see the loaded scopes.\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+Under the `Policies` sub-tab there are filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the Roles, or Groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be programmatically defined using JavaScript where logic can take into account the context of the client session - for example, client ip (that is client ip of the Kafka client).\n+\n+Then, finally, there is the `Permissions` sub-tab, which defines 'role bindings' where `resources`, `authorization scopes` and `policies` are tied together to apply a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Each `permission` definition can have a nice descriptive name which can make it very clear what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+    Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+    Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+## Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "0bab89961e4af7af74c896083be2f6d4fe0cc74f"}, "originalPosition": 164}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NTM3Njg0NDI2", "url": "https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/pull/3989#pullrequestreview-537684426", "createdAt": "2020-11-24T16:19:56Z", "commit": {"oid": "0bab89961e4af7af74c896083be2f6d4fe0cc74f"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0yNFQxNjoxOTo1NlrOH5KlXA==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0yNFQxNjoxOTo1NlrOH5KlXA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyOTcwNDI4NA==", "bodyText": "Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n            Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n          \n          \n            \n            Navigate in Keycloak to check that the expected resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions are defined.", "url": "https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/pull/3989#discussion_r529704284", "createdAt": "2020-11-24T16:19:56Z", "author": {"login": "PaulRMellor"}, "path": "documentation/modules/oauth/con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-example.adoc", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,452 @@\n+// Module included in the following module:\n+//\n+// con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-authorization-services.adoc\n+\n+[id='con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-example_{context}']\n+= Keycloak Authorization Services Example\n+\n+## Token Based Authorization with Keycloak Authorization Services\n+\n+Once the Kafka Broker has obtained an access token by using Strimzi Kafka OAuth for authentication, it is possible to use centrally managed authorization rules to enforce access restrictions onto Kafka Clients.\n+For this Strimzi Kafka OAuth supports the use of `Keycloak Authorization Services`.\n+\n+A custom authorizer has to be configured on the Kafka Broker to take advantage of Authorization Services REST endpoints available on Keycloak, which provide a list of granted permissions on resources for authenticated users.\n+The list of grants (permissions) is first fetched during the first action after authenticated session is established by Kafka client, and then regularly refreshed in the background.\n+Grants are cached, and enforced locally on the Kafka Broker for each user session in order to provide fast authorization decisions.

Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, the `permissions` tie together specific `resources`, `action scopes` and `policies` to define that 'specific users U can perform certain actions A on the resource R'.\n+\n+You can read more about `Keycloak Authorization Services` on link:https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/index.html[project's web site], but note that the documentation there is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources, whereas here we're using it to protect access to Kafka.\n+\n+If we take a look under the `Resources` sub-tab of `Authorization` tab, we'll see the list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers - patterns in a specific format, that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+The format is quite simple. For example:\n+\n+- `kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*`  ... targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_'\n+\n+If `kafka-cluster:XXX` segment is not present, the specifier targets any cluster.\n+\n+- `Group:x_*` ... targets all consumer groups on any cluster with names starting with 'x_'\n+\n+The possible resource types mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model] (`Topic`, `Group`, `Cluster`, ...).\n+\n+Under `Authorization Scopes` we can see a list of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on resources of different types.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+This list mirrors Kafka permissions and should be the same for any deployment.\n+\n+There is an link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file containing the authorization scopes that can be imported, so that they do not have to be manually entered for every new `Authorization Services` enabled client.\n+In order to import `authorization-scopes.json` into a new client, first make sure the new client is `Authorization Enabled` and saved. Then, click on the `Authorization` tab and use the `Import` to import the file. Afterwards, if you select the `Authorization Scopes` you will see the loaded scopes.\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+Under the `Policies` sub-tab there are filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the Roles, or Groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be programmatically defined using JavaScript where logic can take into account the context of the client session - for example, client ip (that is client ip of the Kafka client).\n+\n+Then, finally, there is the `Permissions` sub-tab, which defines 'role bindings' where `resources`, `authorization scopes` and `policies` are tied together to apply a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Each `permission` definition can have a nice descriptive name which can make it very clear what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+    Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+    Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively -

this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "0bab89961e4af7af74c896083be2f6d4fe0cc74f"}, "originalPosition": 171}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NTM3NzAxMzEz", "url": "https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/pull/3989#pullrequestreview-537701313", "createdAt": "2020-11-24T16:37:40Z", "commit": {"oid": "0bab89961e4af7af74c896083be2f6d4fe0cc74f"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0yNFQxNjozNzo0MVrOH5LYUQ==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0yNFQxNjozNzo0MVrOH5LYUQ==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyOTcxNzMyOQ==", "bodyText": "Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n            The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n          \n          \n            \n            NOTE: If `kubectl` times out waiting on the image download, subsequent attempts may result in an _AlreadyExists_ error.", "url": "https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/pull/3989#discussion_r529717329", "createdAt": "2020-11-24T16:37:41Z", "author": {"login": "PaulRMellor"}, "path": "documentation/modules/oauth/con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-example.adoc", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,452 @@\n+// Module included in the following module:\n+//\n+// con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-authorization-services.adoc\n+\n+[id='con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-example_{context}']\n+= Keycloak Authorization Services Example\n+\n+## Token Based Authorization with Keycloak Authorization Services\n+\n+Once the Kafka Broker has obtained an access token by using Strimzi Kafka OAuth for authentication, it is possible to use centrally managed authorization rules to enforce access restrictions onto Kafka Clients.\n+For this Strimzi Kafka OAuth supports the use of `Keycloak Authorization Services`.\n+\n+A custom authorizer has to be configured on the Kafka Broker to take advantage of Authorization Services REST endpoints available on Keycloak, which provide a list of granted permissions on resources for authenticated users.\n+The list of grants (permissions) is first fetched during the first action after authenticated session is established by Kafka client, and then regularly refreshed in the background.\n+Grants are cached, and enforced locally on the Kafka Broker for each user session in order to provide fast authorization decisions.

Typically they are used to geographically or organisationally compartmentalize users into organisations, organisational units, departments, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make some user a member of some group - through a custom LDAP server admin UI for example, which grants them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under `Users`, click on the `View all users` button and you will see two users defined - `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under `Roles` we can see several realm roles which can be used to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to 'tag' users as playing organisational roles and having permissions that pertain to it.\n+In Keycloak the roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider - if that is your requirement then you should use groups instead.\n+\n+Under `Clients` we can see some additional clients configured - `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth2 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth2 client authentication.\n+This client also contains Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client under `Authorization` tab.\n+This tab becomes visible when `Authorization Enabled` is turned on under the `Settings` tab.\n+\n+\n+## Authorization Services - Resources, Authorization Scopes, Policies and Permissions\n+\n+`Keycloak Authorization Services` use several concepts that together take part in defining, and applying access control to resources.\n+\n+`Resources` define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of `authorization scopes` - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+`Policies` define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, the `permissions` tie together specific `resources`, `action scopes` and `policies` to define that 'specific users U can perform certain actions A on the resource R'.\n+\n+You can read more about `Keycloak Authorization Services` on link:https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/index.html[project's web site], but note that the documentation there is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources, whereas here we're using it to protect access to Kafka.\n+\n+If we take a look under the `Resources` sub-tab of `Authorization` tab, we'll see the list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers - patterns in a specific format, that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+The format is quite simple. For example:\n+\n+- `kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*`  ... targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_'\n+\n+If `kafka-cluster:XXX` segment is not present, the specifier targets any cluster.\n+\n+- `Group:x_*` ... targets all consumer groups on any cluster with names starting with 'x_'\n+\n+The possible resource types mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model] (`Topic`, `Group`, `Cluster`, ...).\n+\n+Under `Authorization Scopes` we can see a list of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on resources of different types.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+This list mirrors Kafka permissions and should be the same for any deployment.\n+\n+There is an link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file containing the authorization scopes that can be imported, so that they do not have to be manually entered for every new `Authorization Services` enabled client.\n+In order to import `authorization-scopes.json` into a new client, first make sure the new client is `Authorization Enabled` and saved. Then, click on the `Authorization` tab and use the `Import` to import the file. Afterwards, if you select the `Authorization Scopes` you will see the loaded scopes.\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+Under the `Policies` sub-tab there are filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the Roles, or Groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be programmatically defined using JavaScript where logic can take into account the context of the client session - for example, client ip (that is client ip of the Kafka client).\n+\n+Then, finally, there is the `Permissions` sub-tab, which defines 'role bindings' where `resources`, `authorization scopes` and `policies` are tied together to apply a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Each `permission` definition can have a nice descriptive name which can make it very clear what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+    Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+    Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions -

and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+## Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "0bab89961e4af7af74c896083be2f6d4fe0cc74f"},

background.\n+Grants are cached, and enforced locally on the Kafka Broker for each user session in order to provide fast authorization decisions. Because they are refreshed, any changes at Keycloak side are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+## Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/examples/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+\n+    export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/examples\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for the Keycloak\n+\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` but something else (for example, `default`), then use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+    curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+\n+\n+## Using the Keycloak Admin Console to Configure Authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+    kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+\n+Now use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as both a username, and a password.\n+\n+In the upper left corner under the Keycloak icon you should see `Master` selected as the current realm.\n+Moving the mouse pointer over it should reveal two additional realms - `Demo` and `Kafka-authz`.\n+\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Selecting it will open the `Realm Settings` for the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Next to the `Realm Settings` there are other sections we are interested in - `Groups`, `Roles`, `Clients` and `Users`.\n+\n+Under `Groups` we can see several groups that can be used to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with name assigned. Typically they are used to geographically or organisationally compartmentalize users into organisations, organisational units, departments, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make some user a member of some group - through a custom LDAP server admin UI for example, which grants them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under `Users`, click on the `View all users` button and you will see two users defined - `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under `Roles` we can see several realm roles which can be used to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to 'tag' users as playing organisational roles and having permissions that pertain to it.\n+In Keycloak the roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider - if that is your requirement then you should use groups instead.\n+\n+Under `Clients` we can see some additional clients configured - `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth2 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth2 client authentication.\n+This client also contains Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client under `Authorization` tab.\n+This tab becomes visible when `Authorization Enabled` is turned on under the `Settings` tab.\n+\n+\n+## Authorization Services - Resources, Authorization Scopes, Policies and Permissions\n+\n+`Keycloak Authorization Services` use several concepts that together take part in defining, and applying access control to resources.\n+\n+`Resources` define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of `authorization scopes` - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+`Policies` define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, the `permissions` tie together specific `resources`, `action scopes` and `policies` to define that 'specific users U can perform certain actions A on the resource R'.\n+\n+You can read more about `Keycloak Authorization Services` on link:https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/index.html[project's web site], but note that the documentation there is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources, whereas here we're using it to protect access to Kafka.\n+\n+If we take a look under the `Resources` sub-tab of `Authorization` tab, we'll see the list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers - patterns in a specific format, that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+The format is quite simple. For example:\n+\n+- `kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*`  ... targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_'\n+\n+If `kafka-cluster:XXX` segment is not present, the specifier targets any cluster.\n+\n+- `Group:x_*` ... targets all consumer groups on any cluster with names starting with 'x_'\n+\n+The possible resource types mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model] (`Topic`, `Group`, `Cluster`, ...).\n+\n+Under `Authorization Scopes` we can see a list of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on resources of different types.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+This list mirrors Kafka permissions and should be the same for any deployment.\n+\n+There is an link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file containing the authorization scopes that can be imported, so that they do not have to be manually entered for every new `Authorization Services` enabled client.\n+In order to import `authorization-scopes.json` into a new client, first make sure the new client is `Authorization Enabled` and saved. Then, click on the `Authorization` tab and use the `Import` to import the file. Afterwards, if you select the `Authorization Scopes` you will see the loaded scopes.\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+Under the `Policies` sub-tab there are filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the Roles, or Groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be programmatically defined using JavaScript where logic can take into account the context of the client session - for example, client ip (that is client ip of the Kafka client).\n+\n+Then, finally, there is the `Permissions` sub-tab, which defines 'role bindings' where `resources`, `authorization scopes` and `policies` are tied together to apply a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Each `permission` definition can have a nice descriptive name which can make it very clear what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+    Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+    Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+## Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0

attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file

Typically they are used to geographically or organisationally compartmentalize users into organisations, organisational units, departments, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make some user a member of some group - through a custom LDAP server admin UI for example, which grants them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under `Users`, click on the `View all users` button and you will see two users defined - `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under `Roles` we can see several realm roles which can be used to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to 'tag' users as playing organisational roles and having permissions that pertain to it.\n+In Keycloak the roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider - if that is your requirement then you should use groups instead.\n+\n+Under `Clients` we can see some additional clients configured - `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth2 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth2 client authentication.\n+This client also contains Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client under `Authorization` tab.\n+This tab becomes visible when `Authorization Enabled` is turned on under the `Settings` tab.\n+\n+\n+## Authorization Services - Resources, Authorization Scopes, Policies and Permissions\n+\n+`Keycloak Authorization Services` use several concepts that together take part in defining, and applying access control to resources.\n+\n+`Resources` define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of `authorization scopes` - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+`Policies` define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, the `permissions` tie together specific `resources`, `action scopes` and `policies` to define that 'specific users U can perform certain actions A on the resource R'.\n+\n+You can read more about `Keycloak Authorization Services` on link:https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/index.html[project's web site], but note that the documentation there is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources, whereas here we're using it to protect access to Kafka.\n+\n+If we take a look under the `Resources` sub-tab of `Authorization` tab, we'll see the list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers - patterns in a specific format, that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+The format is quite simple. For example:\n+\n+- `kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*`  ... targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_'\n+\n+If `kafka-cluster:XXX` segment is not present, the specifier targets any cluster.\n+\n+- `Group:x_*` ... targets all consumer groups on any cluster with names starting with 'x_'\n+\n+The possible resource types mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model] (`Topic`, `Group`, `Cluster`, ...).\n+\n+Under `Authorization Scopes` we can see a list of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on resources of different types.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+This list mirrors Kafka permissions and should be the same for any deployment.\n+\n+There is an link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file containing the authorization scopes that can be imported, so that they do not have to be manually entered for every new `Authorization Services` enabled client.\n+In order to import `authorization-scopes.json` into a new client, first make sure the new client is `Authorization Enabled` and saved. Then, click on the `Authorization` tab and use the `Import` to import the file. Afterwards, if you select the `Authorization Scopes` you will see the loaded scopes.\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+Under the `Policies` sub-tab there are filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the Roles, or Groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be programmatically defined using JavaScript where logic can take into account the context of the client session - for example, client ip (that is client ip of the Kafka client).\n+\n+Then, finally, there is the `Permissions` sub-tab, which defines 'role bindings' where `resources`, `authorization scopes` and `policies` are tied together to apply a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Each `permission` definition can have a nice descriptive name which can make it very clear what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+    Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+    Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+## Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties << EOF\n+security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT\n+sasl.mechanism=OAUTHBEARER\n+sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required \\\n+  oauth.client.id=\"team-a-client\" \\\n+  oauth.client.secret=\"team-a-client-secret\" \\\n+  oauth.token.endpoint.uri=\"http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/kafka-authz/protocol/openid-connect/token\" ;\n+sasl.login.callback.handler.class=io.strimzi.kafka.oauth.client.JaasClientOauthLoginCallbackHandler\n+EOF\n+```", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "0bab89961e4af7af74c896083be2f6d4fe0cc74f"}, "originalPosition": 193}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NTM3NzEzMTc4", "url": "https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/pull/3989#pullrequestreview-537713178", "createdAt": "2020-11-24T16:50:23Z", "commit": {"oid": "0bab89961e4af7af74c896083be2f6d4fe0cc74f"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0yNFQxNjo1MDoyM1rOH5L71w==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0yNFQxNjo1MDoyM1rOH5L71w==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyOTcyNjQyMw==", "bodyText": "Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n            In the Keycloak Console you can find which roles are assigned to the `team-a-client` service account, by selecting `team-a-client` in the `Clients` section.\n          \n          \n            \n            and then opening the `Service Account Roles` tab for the client.\n          \n          \n            \n            You should see the `Dev Team A` realm role assigned.\n          \n          \n            \n            The roles assigned to a client, such as the `Dev Team A` realm role assigned to the `team-a-client` service account, are presented in Keycloak on the  *Service Account Roles* tab from *Clients*.", "url": "https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/pull/3989#discussion_r529726423", "createdAt": "2020-11-24T16:50:23Z", "author": {"login": "PaulRMellor"}, "path": "documentation/modules/oauth/con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-example.adoc", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,452 @@\n+// Module included in the following module:\n+//\n+// con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-authorization-services.adoc\n+\n+[id='con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-example_{context}']\n+= Keycloak Authorization Services Example\n+\n+## Token Based Authorization with Keycloak Authorization Services\n+\n+Once the Kafka Broker has obtained an access token by using Strimzi Kafka OAuth for authentication, it is possible to use centrally managed authorization rules to enforce access restrictions onto Kafka Clients.\n+For this Strimzi Kafka OAuth supports the use of `Keycloak Authorization Services`.\n+\n+A custom authorizer has to be configured on the Kafka Broker to take advantage of Authorization Services REST endpoints available on Keycloak, which provide a list of granted permissions on resources for authenticated users.\n+The list of grants (permissions) is first fetched during the first action after authenticated session is established by Kafka client, and then regularly refreshed in the background.\n+Grants are cached, and enforced locally on the Kafka Broker for each user session in order to provide fast authorization decisions.

this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties << EOF\n+security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT\n+sasl.mechanism=OAUTHBEARER\n+sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required \\\n+  oauth.client.id=\"team-a-client\" \\\n+  oauth.client.secret=\"team-a-client-secret\" \\\n+  oauth.token.endpoint.uri=\"http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/kafka-authz/protocol/openid-connect/token\" ;\n+sasl.login.callback.handler.class=io.strimzi.kafka.oauth.client.JaasClientOauthLoginCallbackHandler\n+EOF\n+```\n+\n+In the Keycloak Console you can find which roles are assigned to the `team-a-client` service account, by selecting `team-a-client` in the `Clients` section.\n+and then opening the `Service Account Roles` tab for the client.\n+You should see the `Dev Team A` realm role assigned.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "0bab89961e4af7af74c896083be2f6d4fe0cc74f"}, "originalPosition": 197}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NTM3NzE4Mjg3", "url": "https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/pull/3989#pullrequestreview-537718287", "createdAt": "2020-11-24T16:55:45Z", "commit": {"oid": "0bab89961e4af7af74c896083be2f6d4fe0cc74f"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0yNFQxNjo1NTo0NVrOH5MLWg==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0yNFQxNjo1NTo0NVrOH5MLWg==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyOTczMDM5NA==", "bodyText": "Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n            We can now use this configuration with Kafka's CLI tools.\n          \n          \n            \n            We can use this configuration from the Kafka CLI to produce and consume messages, and perform other administration tasks.", "url": "https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/pull/3989#discussion_r529730394", "createdAt": "2020-11-24T16:55:45Z", "author": {"login": "PaulRMellor"}, "path": "documentation/modules/oauth/con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-example.adoc", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,452 @@\n+// Module included in the following module:\n+//\n+// con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-authorization-services.adoc\n+\n+[id='con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-example_{context}']\n+= Keycloak Authorization Services Example\n+\n+## Token Based Authorization with Keycloak Authorization Services\n+\n+Once the Kafka Broker has obtained an access token by using Strimzi Kafka OAuth for authentication, it is possible to use centrally managed authorization rules to enforce access restrictions onto Kafka Clients.\n+For this Strimzi Kafka OAuth supports the use of `Keycloak Authorization Services`.\n+\n+A custom authorizer has to be configured on the Kafka Broker to take advantage of Authorization Services REST endpoints available on Keycloak, which provide a list of granted permissions on resources for authenticated users.\n+The list of grants (permissions) is first fetched during the first action after authenticated session is established by Kafka client, and then regularly refreshed in the background.\n+Grants are cached, and enforced locally on the Kafka Broker for each user session in order to provide fast authorization decisions.

Typically they are used to geographically or organisationally compartmentalize users into organisations, organisational units, departments, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make some user a member of some group - through a custom LDAP server admin UI for example, which grants them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under `Users`, click on the `View all users` button and you will see two users defined - `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under `Roles` we can see several realm roles which can be used to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to 'tag' users as playing organisational roles and having permissions that pertain to it.\n+In Keycloak the roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider - if that is your requirement then you should use groups instead.\n+\n+Under `Clients` we can see some additional clients configured - `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth2 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth2 client authentication.\n+This client also contains Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client under `Authorization` tab.\n+This tab becomes visible when `Authorization Enabled` is turned on under the `Settings` tab.\n+\n+\n+## Authorization Services - Resources, Authorization Scopes, Policies and Permissions\n+\n+`Keycloak Authorization Services` use several concepts that together take part in defining, and applying access control to resources.\n+\n+`Resources` define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of `authorization scopes` - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+`Policies` define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, the `permissions` tie together specific `resources`, `action scopes` and `policies` to define that 'specific users U can perform certain actions A on the resource R'.\n+\n+You can read more about `Keycloak Authorization Services` on link:https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/index.html[project's web site], but note that the documentation there is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources, whereas here we're using it to protect access to Kafka.\n+\n+If we take a look under the `Resources` sub-tab of `Authorization` tab, we'll see the list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers - patterns in a specific format, that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+The format is quite simple. For example:\n+\n+- `kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*`  ... targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_'\n+\n+If `kafka-cluster:XXX` segment is not present, the specifier targets any cluster.\n+\n+- `Group:x_*` ... targets all consumer groups on any cluster with names starting with 'x_'\n+\n+The possible resource types mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model] (`Topic`, `Group`, `Cluster`, ...).\n+\n+Under `Authorization Scopes` we can see a list of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on resources of different types.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+This list mirrors Kafka permissions and should be the same for any deployment.\n+\n+There is an link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file containing the authorization scopes that can be imported, so that they do not have to be manually entered for every new `Authorization Services` enabled client.\n+In order to import `authorization-scopes.json` into a new client, first make sure the new client is `Authorization Enabled` and saved. Then, click on the `Authorization` tab and use the `Import` to import the file. Afterwards, if you select the `Authorization Scopes` you will see the loaded scopes.\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+Under the `Policies` sub-tab there are filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the Roles, or Groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be programmatically defined using JavaScript where logic can take into account the context of the client session - for example, client ip (that is client ip of the Kafka client).\n+\n+Then, finally, there is the `Permissions` sub-tab, which defines 'role bindings' where `resources`, `authorization scopes` and `policies` are tied together to apply a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Each `permission` definition can have a nice descriptive name which can make it very clear what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+    Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+    Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions -

any cluster\n+\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+## Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties << EOF\n+security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT\n+sasl.mechanism=OAUTHBEARER\n+sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required \\\n+

;\n+sasl.login.callback.handler.class=io.strimzi.kafka.oauth.client.JaasClientOauthLoginCallbackHandler\n+EOF\n+```\n+\n+In the Keycloak Console you can find which roles are assigned to the `team-a-client` service account, by selecting `team-a-client` in the `Clients` section.\n+and then opening the `Service Account Roles` tab for the client.\n+You should see the `Dev Team A` realm role

to use centrally managed authorization rules to enforce access restrictions onto Kafka Clients.\n+For this Strimzi Kafka OAuth supports the use of `Keycloak Authorization Services`.\n+\n+A custom

authenticated users.\n+The list of grants (permissions) is first fetched during the first action after authenticated session is established by Kafka client, and then regularly refreshed in the background.\n+Grants are cached, and enforced locally on the Kafka Broker for each user session in order to provide fast authorization decisions. Because they are refreshed, any changes at Keycloak side are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+## Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/examples/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+\n+    export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/examples\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for the Keycloak\n+\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` but something else (for example, `default`), then use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+    curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+\n+\n+## Using the Keycloak Admin Console to Configure Authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+    kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+\n+Now use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as both a username, and a password.\n+\n+In the upper left corner under the Keycloak icon you should see `Master` selected as the current realm.\n+Moving the mouse pointer over it should reveal two additional realms - `Demo` and `Kafka-authz`.\n+\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Selecting it will open the `Realm Settings` for the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Next to the `Realm Settings` there are other sections we are interested in - `Groups`, `Roles`, `Clients` and `Users`.\n+\n+Under `Groups` we can see several groups that can be used to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with name assigned. Typically they are used to geographically or organisationally compartmentalize users into organisations, organisational units, departments, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make some user a member of some group - through a custom LDAP server admin UI for example, which grants them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under `Users`, click on the `View all users` button and you will see two users defined - `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under `Roles` we can see several realm roles which can be used to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to 'tag' users as playing organisational roles and having permissions that pertain to it.\n+In Keycloak the roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider - if that is your requirement then you should use groups instead.\n+\n+Under `Clients` we can see some additional clients configured - `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth2 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth2 client authentication.\n+This client also contains Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client under `Authorization` tab.\n+This tab becomes visible when `Authorization Enabled` is turned on under the `Settings` tab.\n+\n+\n+## Authorization Services - Resources, Authorization Scopes, Policies and Permissions\n+\n+`Keycloak Authorization Services` use several concepts that together take part in defining, and applying access control to resources.\n+\n+`Resources` define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of `authorization scopes` - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+`Policies` define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, the `permissions` tie together specific `resources`, `action scopes` and `policies` to define that 'specific users U can perform certain actions A on the resource R'.\n+\n+You can read more about `Keycloak Authorization Services` on link:https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/index.html[project's web site], but note that the documentation there is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources, whereas here we're using it to protect access to Kafka.\n+\n+If we take a look under the `Resources` sub-tab of `Authorization` tab, we'll see the list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers - patterns in a specific format, that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+The format is quite simple. For example:\n+\n+- `kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*`  ... targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_'\n+\n+If `kafka-cluster:XXX` segment is not present, the specifier targets any cluster.\n+\n+- `Group:x_*` ... targets all consumer groups on any cluster with names starting with 'x_'\n+\n+The possible resource types mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model] (`Topic`, `Group`, `Cluster`, ...).\n+\n+Under `Authorization Scopes` we can see a list of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on resources of different types.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+This list mirrors Kafka permissions and should be the same for any deployment.\n+\n+There is an link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file containing the authorization scopes that can be imported, so that they do not have to be manually entered for every new `Authorization Services` enabled client.\n+In order to import `authorization-scopes.json` into a new client, first make sure the new client is `Authorization Enabled` and saved. Then, click on the `Authorization` tab and use the `Import` to import the file. Afterwards, if you select the `Authorization Scopes` you will see the loaded scopes.\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+Under the `Policies` sub-tab there are filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the Roles, or Groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be programmatically defined using JavaScript where logic can take into account the context of the client session - for example, client ip (that is client ip of the Kafka client).\n+\n+Then, finally, there is the `Permissions` sub-tab, which defines 'role bindings' where `resources`, `authorization scopes` and `policies` are tied together to apply a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Each `permission` definition can have a nice descriptive name which can make it very clear what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+    Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+    Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a

Typically they are used to geographically or organisationally compartmentalize users into organisations, organisational units, departments, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make some user a member of some group - through a custom LDAP server admin UI for example, which grants them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under `Users`, click on the `View all users` button and you will see two users defined - `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under `Roles` we can see several realm roles which can be used to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to 'tag' users as playing organisational roles and having permissions that pertain to it.\n+In Keycloak the roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider - if that is your requirement then you should use groups instead.\n+\n+Under `Clients` we can see some additional clients configured - `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth2 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth2 client authentication.\n+This client also contains Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client under `Authorization` tab.\n+This tab becomes visible when `Authorization Enabled` is turned on under the `Settings` tab.\n+\n+\n+## Authorization Services - Resources, Authorization Scopes, Policies and Permissions\n+\n+`Keycloak Authorization Services` use several concepts that together take part in defining, and applying access control to resources.\n+\n+`Resources` define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of `authorization scopes` - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+`Policies` define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, the `permissions` tie together specific `resources`, `action scopes` and `policies` to define that 'specific users U can perform certain actions A on the resource R'.\n+\n+You can read more about `Keycloak Authorization Services` on link:https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/index.html[project's web site], but note that the documentation there is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources, whereas here we're using it to protect access to Kafka.\n+\n+If we take a look under the `Resources` sub-tab of `Authorization` tab, we'll see the list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers - patterns in a specific format, that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+The format is quite simple. For example:\n+\n+- `kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*`  ... targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_'\n+\n+If `kafka-cluster:XXX` segment is not present, the specifier targets any cluster.\n+\n+- `Group:x_*` ... targets all consumer groups on any cluster with names starting with 'x_'\n+\n+The possible resource types mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model] (`Topic`, `Group`, `Cluster`, ...).\n+\n+Under `Authorization Scopes` we can see a list of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on resources of different types.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+This list mirrors Kafka permissions and should be the same for any deployment.\n+\n+There is an link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file containing the authorization scopes that can be imported, so that they do not have to be manually entered for every new `Authorization Services` enabled client.\n+In order to import `authorization-scopes.json` into a new client, first make sure the new client is `Authorization Enabled` and saved. Then, click on the `Authorization` tab and use the `Import` to import the file. Afterwards, if you select the `Authorization Scopes` you will see the loaded scopes.\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+Under the `Policies` sub-tab there are filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the Roles, or Groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be programmatically defined using JavaScript where logic can take into account the context of the client session - for example, client ip (that is client ip of the Kafka client).\n+\n+Then, finally, there is the `Permissions` sub-tab, which defines 'role bindings' where `resources`, `authorization scopes` and `policies` are tied together to apply a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Each `permission` definition can have a nice descriptive name which can make it very clear what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+    Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+    Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+## Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties <<

Authorization with Keycloak Authorization Services\n+\n+Once the Kafka Broker has obtained an access token by using Strimzi Kafka OAuth for authentication, it is possible to use centrally managed authorization rules to enforce access restrictions onto Kafka Clients.\n+For this Strimzi Kafka OAuth supports the use of `Keycloak Authorization Services`.\n+\n+A custom authorizer has to be configured on the Kafka Broker to take advantage of Authorization Services REST endpoints available on Keycloak, which provide a list of granted permissions on resources for authenticated users.\n+The list of grants (permissions) is first fetched during the first action after authenticated session is established by Kafka client, and then regularly refreshed in the background.\n+Grants are cached, and enforced locally on the Kafka Broker for each user session in order to provide fast authorization decisions. Because they are refreshed, any changes at Keycloak side are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+## Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/examples/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+\n+    export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/examples\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for the Keycloak\n+\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` but something else (for example, `default`), then use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+    curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+\n+\n+## Using the Keycloak Admin Console to Configure Authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+    kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+\n+Now use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as both a username, and a password.\n+\n+In the upper left corner under the Keycloak icon you should see `Master` selected as the current realm.\n+Moving the mouse pointer over it should reveal two additional realms - `Demo` and `Kafka-authz`.\n+\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Selecting it will open the `Realm Settings` for the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Next to the `Realm Settings` there are other sections we are interested in - `Groups`, `Roles`, `Clients` and `Users`.\n+\n+Under `Groups` we can see several groups that can be used to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with name assigned.

Typically they are used to geographically or organisationally compartmentalize users into organisations, organisational units, departments, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make some user a member of some group - through a custom LDAP server admin UI for example, which grants them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under `Users`, click on the `View all users` button and you will see two users defined - `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under `Roles` we can see several realm roles which can be used to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to 'tag' users as playing organisational roles and having permissions that pertain to it.\n+In Keycloak the roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider - if that is your requirement then you should use groups instead.\n+\n+Under `Clients` we can see some additional clients configured - `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth2 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth2 client authentication.\n+This client also contains Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client under `Authorization` tab.\n+This tab becomes visible when `Authorization Enabled` is turned on under the `Settings` tab.\n+\n+\n+## Authorization Services - Resources, Authorization Scopes, Policies and Permissions\n+\n+`Keycloak Authorization Services` use several concepts that together take part in defining, and applying access control to resources.\n+\n+`Resources` define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of `authorization scopes` - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+`Policies` define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, the `permissions` tie together specific `resources`, `action scopes` and `policies` to define that 'specific users U can perform certain actions A on the resource R'.\n+\n+You can read more about `Keycloak Authorization Services` on link:https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/index.html[project's web site], but note that the documentation there is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources, whereas here we're using it to protect access to Kafka.\n+\n+If we take a look under the `Resources` sub-tab of `Authorization` tab, we'll see the list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers - patterns in a specific format, that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+The format is quite simple. For example:\n+\n+- `kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*`  ... targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_'\n+\n+If `kafka-cluster:XXX` segment is not present, the specifier targets any cluster.\n+\n+- `Group:x_*` ... targets all consumer groups on any cluster with names starting with 'x_'\n+\n+The possible resource types mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model] (`Topic`, `Group`, `Cluster`, ...).\n+\n+Under `Authorization Scopes` we can see a list of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on resources of different types.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+This list mirrors Kafka permissions and should be the same for any deployment.\n+\n+There is an link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file containing the authorization scopes that can be imported, so that they do not have to be manually entered for every new `Authorization Services` enabled client.\n+In order to import `authorization-scopes.json` into a new client, first make sure the new client is `Authorization Enabled` and saved. Then, click on the `Authorization` tab and use the `Import` to import the file. Afterwards, if you select the `Authorization Scopes` you will see the loaded scopes.\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+Under the `Policies` sub-tab there are filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the Roles, or Groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be programmatically defined using JavaScript where logic can take into account the context of the client session - for example, client ip (that is client ip of the Kafka client).\n+\n+Then, finally, there is the `Permissions` sub-tab, which defines 'role bindings' where `resources`, `authorization scopes` and `policies` are tied together to apply a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Each `permission` definition can have a nice descriptive name which can make it very clear what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+    Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+    Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+## Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties << EOF\n+security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT\n+sasl.mechanism=OAUTHBEARER\n+sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required \\\n+  oauth.client.id=\"team-a-client\" \\\n+  oauth.client.secret=\"team-a-client-secret\" \\\n+  oauth.token.endpoint.uri=\"http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/kafka-authz/protocol/openid-connect/token\" ;\n+sasl.login.callback.handler.class=io.strimzi.kafka.oauth.client.JaasClientOauthLoginCallbackHandler\n+EOF\n+```\n+\n+In the Keycloak Console you can find which roles are assigned to the `team-a-client` service account, by selecting `team-a-client` in the `Clients` section.\n+and then opening the `Service Account Roles` tab for the client.\n+You should see the `Dev Team A` realm role assigned.\n+\n+We can now use this configuration with Kafka's CLI tools.\n+\n+\n+### Producing the Messages\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages to topic 'my-topic':\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic my-topic \\\n+  --producer.config=/tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+```\n+\n+When we press `Enter` to push the first message we receive `Not authorized to access topics: [my-topic]` error.\n+\n+`team-a-client` has a `Dev Team A` role which gives it permissions to do anything on topics that start with 'a_', and only write to topics that start with 'x_'.\n+The topic named `my-topic` matches neither of those.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo":

Afterwards, if you select the `Authorization Scopes` you will see the loaded scopes.\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+Under the `Policies` sub-tab there are filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the Roles, or Groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be programmatically defined using JavaScript where logic can take into account the context of the client session - for example, client ip (that is client ip of the Kafka client).\n+\n+Then, finally, there is the `Permissions` sub-tab, which defines 'role bindings' where `resources`, `authorization scopes` and `policies` are tied together to apply a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Each `permission` definition can have a nice descriptive name which can make it very clear what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+    Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+    Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+## Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties <<

Authorization with Keycloak Authorization Services\n+\n+Once the Kafka Broker has obtained an access token by using Strimzi Kafka OAuth for authentication, it is possible to use centrally managed authorization rules to enforce access restrictions onto Kafka Clients.\n+For this Strimzi Kafka OAuth supports the use of `Keycloak Authorization Services`.\n+\n+A custom authorizer has to be configured on the Kafka Broker to take advantage of Authorization Services REST endpoints available on Keycloak, which provide a list of granted permissions on resources for authenticated users.\n+The list of grants (permissions) is first fetched during the first action after authenticated session is established by Kafka client, and then regularly refreshed in the background.\n+Grants are cached, and enforced locally on the Kafka Broker for each user session in order to provide fast authorization decisions. Because they are refreshed, any changes at Keycloak side are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+## Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/examples/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+\n+    export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/examples\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for the Keycloak\n+\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` but something else (for example, `default`), then use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+    curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+\n+\n+## Using the Keycloak Admin Console to Configure Authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+    kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+\n+Now use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as both a username, and a password.\n+\n+In the upper left corner under the Keycloak icon you should see `Master` selected as the current realm.\n+Moving the mouse pointer over it should reveal two additional realms - `Demo` and `Kafka-authz`.\n+\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Selecting it will open the `Realm Settings` for the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Next to the `Realm Settings` there are other sections we are interested in - `Groups`, `Roles`, `Clients` and `Users`.\n+\n+Under `Groups` we can see several groups that can be used to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with name assigned. Typically they are used to geographically or organisationally compartmentalize users into organisations, organisational units, departments, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make some user a member of some group - through a custom LDAP server admin UI for example, which grants them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under `Users`, click on the `View all users` button and you will see two users defined - `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under `Roles` we can see several realm roles which can be used to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to 'tag' users as playing organisational roles and having permissions that pertain to it.\n+In Keycloak the roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider - if that is your requirement then you should use groups instead.\n+\n+Under `Clients` we can see some additional clients configured - `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth2 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth2 client authentication.\n+This client also contains Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client under `Authorization` tab.\n+This tab becomes visible when `Authorization Enabled` is turned on under the `Settings` tab.\n+\n+\n+## Authorization Services - Resources, Authorization Scopes, Policies and Permissions\n+\n+`Keycloak Authorization Services` use several concepts that together take part in defining, and applying access control to resources.\n+\n+`Resources` define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of `authorization scopes` - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+`Policies` define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, the `permissions` tie together specific `resources`, `action scopes` and `policies` to define that 'specific users U can perform certain actions A on the resource R'.\n+\n+You can read more about `Keycloak Authorization Services` on link:https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/index.html[project's web site], but note that the documentation there is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources, whereas here we're using it to protect access to Kafka.\n+\n+If we take a look under the `Resources` sub-tab of `Authorization` tab, we'll see the list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers - patterns in a specific format, that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+The format is quite simple. For example:\n+\n+- `kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*`  ... targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_'\n+\n+If `kafka-cluster:XXX` segment is not present, the specifier targets any cluster.\n+\n+- `Group:x_*` ... targets all consumer groups on any cluster with names starting with 'x_'\n+\n+The possible resource types mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model] (`Topic`, `Group`, `Cluster`, ...).\n+\n+Under `Authorization Scopes` we can see a list of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on resources of different types.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+This list mirrors Kafka permissions and should be the same for any deployment.\n+\n+There is an link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file containing the authorization scopes that can be imported, so that they do not have to be manually entered for every new `Authorization Services` enabled client.\n+In order to import `authorization-scopes.json` into a new client, first make sure the new client is `Authorization Enabled` and saved. Then, click on the `Authorization` tab and use the `Import` to import the file. Afterwards, if you select the `Authorization Scopes` you will see the loaded scopes.\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+Under the

certain users.\n+\n+Each `permission` definition can have a nice descriptive name which can make it very clear what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+    Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+    Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and

Because they are refreshed, any changes at Keycloak side are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+## Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/examples/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+\n+    export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/examples\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for the Keycloak\n+\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` but something else (for example, `default`), then use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+    curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+\n+\n+## Using the Keycloak Admin Console to Configure Authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+    kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+\n+Now use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as both a username, and a password.\n+\n+In the upper left corner under the Keycloak icon you should see `Master` selected as the current realm.\n+Moving the mouse pointer over it should reveal two additional realms - `Demo` and `Kafka-authz`.\n+\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Selecting it will open the `Realm Settings` for the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Next to the `Realm Settings` there are other sections we are interested in - `Groups`, `Roles`, `Clients` and `Users`.\n+\n+Under `Groups` we can see several groups that can be used to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with name assigned. Typically they are used to geographically or organisationally compartmentalize users into organisations, organisational units, departments, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make some user a member of some group - through a custom LDAP server admin UI for example, which grants them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under `Users`, click on the `View all users` button and you will see two users defined - `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under `Roles` we can see several realm roles which can be used to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to 'tag' users as playing organisational roles and having permissions that pertain to it.\n+In Keycloak the roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider - if that is your requirement then you should use groups instead.\n+\n+Under `Clients` we can see some additional clients configured - `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth2 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth2 client authentication.\n+This client also contains Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client under `Authorization` tab.\n+This tab becomes visible when `Authorization Enabled` is turned on under the `Settings` tab.\n+\n+\n+## Authorization Services - Resources, Authorization Scopes, Policies and Permissions\n+\n+`Keycloak Authorization Services` use several concepts that together take part in defining, and applying access control to resources.\n+\n+`Resources` define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of `authorization scopes` - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+`Policies` define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, the `permissions` tie together specific `resources`, `action scopes` and `policies` to define that 'specific users U can perform certain actions A on the resource R'.\n+\n+You can read more about `Keycloak Authorization Services` on link:https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/index.html[project's web site], but note that the documentation there is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources, whereas here we're using it to protect access to Kafka.\n+\n+If we take a look under the `Resources` sub-tab of `Authorization` tab, we'll see the list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers - patterns in a specific format, that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+The format is quite simple. For example:\n+\n+- `kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*`  ... targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_'\n+\n+If `kafka-cluster:XXX` segment is not present, the specifier targets any cluster.\n+\n+- `Group:x_*` ... targets all consumer groups on any cluster with names starting with 'x_'\n+\n+The possible resource types mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model] (`Topic`, `Group`, `Cluster`, ...).\n+\n+Under `Authorization Scopes` we can see a list of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on resources of different types.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+This list mirrors Kafka permissions and should be the same for any deployment.\n+\n+There is an link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file containing the authorization scopes that can be imported, so that they do not have to be manually entered for every new `Authorization Services` enabled client.\n+In order to import `authorization-scopes.json` into a new client, first make sure the new client is `Authorization Enabled` and saved. Then, click on the `Authorization` tab and use the `Import` to import the file. Afterwards, if you select the `Authorization Scopes` you will see the loaded scopes.\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+Under the `Policies` sub-tab there are filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the Roles, or Groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be programmatically defined using JavaScript where logic can take into account the context of the client session - for example, client ip (that is client ip of the Kafka client).\n+\n+Then, finally, there is the `Permissions` sub-tab, which defines 'role bindings' where `resources`, `authorization scopes` and `policies` are tied together to apply a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Each `permission` definition can have a nice descriptive name which can make it very clear what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+    Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+    Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+## Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties <<

Authorization with Keycloak Authorization Services\n+\n+Once the Kafka Broker has obtained an access token by using Strimzi Kafka OAuth for authentication, it is possible to use centrally managed authorization rules to enforce access restrictions onto Kafka Clients.\n+For this Strimzi Kafka OAuth supports the use of `Keycloak Authorization Services`.\n+\n+A custom authorizer has to be configured on the Kafka Broker to take advantage of Authorization Services REST endpoints available on Keycloak, which provide a list of granted permissions on resources for authenticated users.\n+The list of grants (permissions) is first fetched during the first action after authenticated session is established by Kafka client, and then regularly refreshed in the background.\n+Grants are cached, and enforced locally on the Kafka Broker for each user session in order to provide fast authorization decisions. Because they are refreshed, any changes at Keycloak side are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+## Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/examples/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+\n+    export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/examples\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for the Keycloak\n+\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` but something else (for example, `default`), then use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+    curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+\n+\n+## Using the Keycloak Admin Console to Configure Authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+    kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+\n+Now use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as both a username, and a password.\n+\n+In the upper left corner under the Keycloak icon you should see `Master` selected as the current realm.\n+Moving the mouse pointer over it should reveal two additional realms - `Demo` and `Kafka-authz`.\n+\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Selecting it will open the `Realm Settings` for the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Next to the `Realm Settings` there are other sections we are interested in - `Groups`, `Roles`, `Clients` and `Users`.\n+\n+Under `Groups` we can see several groups that can be used to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with name assigned.

Typically they are used to geographically or organisationally compartmentalize users into organisations, organisational units, departments, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make some user a member of some group - through a custom LDAP server admin UI for example, which grants them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under `Users`, click on the `View all users` button and you will see two users defined - `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under `Roles` we can see several realm roles which can be used to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to 'tag' users as playing organisational roles and having permissions that pertain to it.\n+In Keycloak the roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider - if that is your requirement then you should use groups instead.\n+\n+Under `Clients` we can see some additional clients configured - `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth2 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth2 client authentication.\n+This client also contains Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client under `Authorization` tab.\n+This tab becomes visible when `Authorization Enabled` is turned on under the `Settings` tab.\n+\n+\n+## Authorization Services - Resources, Authorization Scopes, Policies and Permissions\n+\n+`Keycloak Authorization Services` use several concepts that together take part in defining, and applying access control to resources.\n+\n+`Resources` define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of `authorization scopes` - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+`Policies` define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, the `permissions` tie together specific `resources`, `action scopes` and `policies` to define that 'specific users U can perform certain actions A on the resource R'.\n+\n+You can read more about `Keycloak Authorization Services` on link:https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/index.html[project's web site], but note that the documentation there is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources, whereas here we're using it to protect access to Kafka.\n+\n+If we take a look under the `Resources` sub-tab of `Authorization` tab, we'll see the list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers - patterns in a specific format, that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+The format is quite simple. For example:\n+\n+- `kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*`  ... targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_'\n+\n+If `kafka-cluster:XXX` segment is not present, the specifier targets any cluster.\n+\n+- `Group:x_*` ... targets all consumer groups on any cluster with names starting with 'x_'\n+\n+The possible resource types mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model] (`Topic`, `Group`, `Cluster`, ...).\n+\n+Under `Authorization Scopes` we can see a list of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on resources of different types.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+This list mirrors Kafka permissions and should be the same for any deployment.\n+\n+There is an link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file containing the authorization scopes that can be imported, so that they do not have to be manually entered for every new `Authorization Services` enabled client.\n+In order to import `authorization-scopes.json` into a new client, first make sure the new client is `Authorization Enabled` and saved. Then, click on the `Authorization` tab and use the `Import` to import the file. Afterwards, if you select the `Authorization Scopes` you will see the loaded scopes.\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+Under the `Policies` sub-tab there are filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the Roles, or Groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be programmatically defined using JavaScript where logic can take into account the context of the client session - for example, client ip (that is client ip of the Kafka client).\n+\n+Then, finally, there is the `Permissions` sub-tab, which defines 'role bindings' where `resources`, `authorization scopes` and `policies` are tied together to apply a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Each `permission` definition can have a nice descriptive name which can make it very clear what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+    Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+    Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+## Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties <<

Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, the `permissions` tie together specific `resources`, `action scopes` and `policies` to define that 'specific users U can perform certain actions A on the resource R'.\n+\n+You can read more about `Keycloak Authorization Services` on link:https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/index.html[project's web site], but note that the documentation there is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources, whereas here we're using it to protect access to Kafka.\n+\n+If we take a look under the `Resources` sub-tab of `Authorization` tab, we'll see the list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers - patterns in a specific format, that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+The format is quite simple. For example:\n+\n+- `kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*`  ... targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_'\n+\n+If `kafka-cluster:XXX` segment is not present, the specifier targets any cluster.\n+\n+- `Group:x_*` ... targets all consumer groups on any cluster with names starting with 'x_'\n+\n+The possible resource types mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model] (`Topic`, `Group`, `Cluster`, ...).\n+\n+Under `Authorization Scopes` we can see a list of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on resources of different types.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+This list mirrors Kafka permissions and should be the same for any deployment.\n+\n+There is an link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file containing the authorization scopes that can be imported, so that they do not have to be manually entered for every new `Authorization Services` enabled client.\n+In order to import `authorization-scopes.json` into a new client, first make sure the new client is `Authorization Enabled` and saved. Then, click on the `Authorization` tab and use the `Import` to import the file. Afterwards, if you select the `Authorization Scopes` you will see the loaded scopes.\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+Under the `Policies` sub-tab there are filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the Roles, or Groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be programmatically defined using JavaScript where logic can take into account the context of the client session - for example, client ip (that is client ip of the Kafka client).\n+\n+Then, finally, there is the `Permissions` sub-tab, which defines 'role bindings' where `resources`, `authorization scopes` and `policies` are tied together to apply a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Each `permission` definition can have a nice descriptive name which can make it very clear what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+    Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+    Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+## Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties << EOF\n+security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT\n+sasl.mechanism=OAUTHBEARER\n+sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required \\\n+  oauth.client.id=\"team-a-client\" \\\n+  oauth.client.secret=\"team-a-client-secret\" \\\n+  oauth.token.endpoint.uri=\"http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/kafka-authz/protocol/openid-connect/token\" ;\n+sasl.login.callback.handler.class=io.strimzi.kafka.oauth.client.JaasClientOauthLoginCallbackHandler\n+EOF\n+```\n+\n+In the Keycloak Console you can find which roles are assigned to the `team-a-client` service account, by selecting `team-a-client` in the `Clients` section.\n+and then opening the `Service Account Roles` tab for the client.\n+You should see the `Dev Team A` realm role assigned.\n+\n+We can now use this configuration with Kafka's CLI tools.\n+\n+\n+### Producing the Messages\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages to topic 'my-topic':\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic my-topic \\\n+  --producer.config=/tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+```\n+\n+When we press `Enter` to push the first message we receive `Not authorized to access topics: [my-topic]` error.\n+\n+`team-a-client` has a `Dev Team A` role which gives it permissions to do anything on topics that start with 'a_', and only write to topics that start with 'x_'.\n+The topic named `my-topic` matches neither of those.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application, and let's try to write to topic `a_messages`.\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+  --producer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+Second message\n+```\n+\n+Although we can see some unrelated warnings, looking at the Kafka container log there is DEBUG level output saying 'Authorization GRANTED'.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application.\n+\n+You can see the Kafka container log by running:\n+\n+    kubectl logs my-cluster-kafka-0 -f\n+\n+### Consuming the Messages\n+\n+Let's now try to consume the messages we have produced.\n+\n+    bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+      --from-beginning --consumer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "0bab89961e4af7af74c896083be2f6d4fe0cc74f"}, "originalPosition": 239}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NTM3NzM3MjM4", "url": "https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/pull/3989#pullrequestreview-537737238", "createdAt": "2020-11-24T17:17:04Z", "commit": {"oid": "0bab89961e4af7af74c896083be2f6d4fe0cc74f"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0yNFQxNzoxNzowNVrOH5NEcw==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0yNFQxNzoxNzowNVrOH5NEcw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyOTc0NTAxMQ==", "bodyText": "Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n            This gives us an error like: `Not authorized to access group: console-consumer-55841`.\n          \n          \n            \n            \n          \n          \n            \n            The reason is that we have to override the default consumer group name -

Typically they are used to geographically or organisationally compartmentalize users into organisations, organisational units, departments, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make some user a member of some group - through a custom LDAP server admin UI for example, which grants them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under `Users`, click on the `View all users` button and you will see two users defined - `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under `Roles` we can see several realm roles which can be used to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to 'tag' users as playing organisational roles and having permissions that pertain to it.\n+In Keycloak the roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider - if that is your requirement then you should use groups instead.\n+\n+Under `Clients` we can see some additional clients configured - `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth2 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth2 client authentication.\n+This client also contains Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client under `Authorization` tab.\n+This tab becomes visible when `Authorization Enabled` is turned on under the `Settings` tab.\n+\n+\n+## Authorization Services - Resources, Authorization Scopes, Policies and Permissions\n+\n+`Keycloak Authorization Services` use several concepts that together take part in defining, and applying access control to resources.\n+\n+`Resources` define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of `authorization scopes` - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+`Policies` define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, the `permissions` tie together specific `resources`, `action scopes` and `policies` to define that 'specific users U can perform certain actions A on the resource R'.\n+\n+You can read more about `Keycloak Authorization Services` on link:https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/index.html[project's web site], but note that the documentation there is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources, whereas here we're using it to protect access to Kafka.\n+\n+If we take a look under the `Resources` sub-tab of `Authorization` tab, we'll see the list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers - patterns in a specific format, that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+The format is quite simple. For example:\n+\n+- `kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*`  ... targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_'\n+\n+If `kafka-cluster:XXX` segment is not present, the specifier targets any cluster.\n+\n+- `Group:x_*` ... targets all consumer groups on any cluster with names starting with 'x_'\n+\n+The possible resource types mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model] (`Topic`, `Group`, `Cluster`, ...).\n+\n+Under `Authorization Scopes` we can see a list of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on resources of different types.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+This list mirrors Kafka permissions and should be the same for any deployment.\n+\n+There is an link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file containing the authorization scopes that can be imported, so that they do not have to be manually entered for every new `Authorization Services` enabled client.\n+In order to import `authorization-scopes.json` into a new client, first make sure the new client is `Authorization Enabled` and saved. Then, click on the `Authorization` tab and use the `Import` to import the file. Afterwards, if you select the `Authorization Scopes` you will see the loaded scopes.\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+Under the `Policies` sub-tab there are filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the Roles, or Groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be programmatically defined using JavaScript where logic can take into account the context of the client session - for example, client ip (that is client ip of the Kafka client).\n+\n+Then, finally, there is the `Permissions` sub-tab, which defines 'role bindings' where `resources`, `authorization scopes` and `policies` are tied together to apply a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Each `permission` definition can have a nice descriptive name which can make it very clear what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+    Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+    Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+## Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution -

Typically they are used to geographically or organisationally compartmentalize users into organisations, organisational units, departments, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make some user a member of some group - through a custom LDAP server admin UI for example, which grants them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under `Users`, click on the `View all users` button and you will see two users defined - `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under `Roles` we can see several realm roles which can be used to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to 'tag' users as playing organisational roles and having permissions that pertain to it.\n+In Keycloak the roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider - if that is your requirement then you should use groups instead.\n+\n+Under `Clients` we can see some additional clients configured - `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth2 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth2 client authentication.\n+This client also contains Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client under `Authorization` tab.\n+This tab becomes visible when `Authorization Enabled` is turned on under the `Settings` tab.\n+\n+\n+## Authorization Services - Resources, Authorization Scopes, Policies and Permissions\n+\n+`Keycloak Authorization Services` use several concepts that together take part in defining, and applying access control to resources.\n+\n+`Resources` define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of `authorization scopes` - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+`Policies` define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, the `permissions` tie together specific `resources`, `action scopes` and `policies` to define that 'specific users U can perform certain actions A on the resource R'.\n+\n+You can read more about `Keycloak Authorization Services` on link:https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/index.html[project's web site], but note that the documentation there is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources, whereas here we're using it to protect access to Kafka.\n+\n+If we take a look under the `Resources` sub-tab of `Authorization` tab, we'll see the list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers - patterns in a specific format, that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+The format is quite simple. For example:\n+\n+- `kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*`  ... targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_'\n+\n+If `kafka-cluster:XXX` segment is not present, the specifier targets any cluster.\n+\n+- `Group:x_*` ... targets all consumer groups on any cluster with names starting with 'x_'\n+\n+The possible resource types mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model] (`Topic`, `Group`, `Cluster`, ...).\n+\n+Under `Authorization Scopes` we can see a list of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on resources of different types.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+This list mirrors Kafka permissions and should be the same for any deployment.\n+\n+There is an link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file containing the authorization scopes that can be imported, so that they do not have to be manually entered for every new `Authorization Services` enabled client.\n+In order to import `authorization-scopes.json` into a new client, first make sure the new client is `Authorization Enabled` and saved. Then, click on the `Authorization` tab and use the `Import` to import the file. Afterwards, if you select the `Authorization Scopes` you will see the loaded scopes.\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+Under the `Policies` sub-tab there are filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the Roles, or Groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be programmatically defined using JavaScript where logic can take into account the context of the client session - for example, client ip (that is client ip of the Kafka client).\n+\n+Then, finally, there is the `Permissions` sub-tab, which defines 'role bindings' where `resources`, `authorization scopes` and `policies` are tied together to apply a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Each `permission` definition can have a nice descriptive name which can make it very clear what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+    Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+    Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+## Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties << EOF\n+security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT\n+sasl.mechanism=OAUTHBEARER\n+sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required \\\n+  oauth.client.id=\"team-a-client\" \\\n+  oauth.client.secret=\"team-a-client-secret\" \\\n+  oauth.token.endpoint.uri=\"http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/kafka-authz/protocol/openid-connect/token\" ;\n+sasl.login.callback.handler.class=io.strimzi.kafka.oauth.client.JaasClientOauthLoginCallbackHandler\n+EOF\n+```\n+\n+In the Keycloak Console you can find which roles are assigned to the `team-a-client` service account, by selecting `team-a-client` in the `Clients` section.\n+and then opening the `Service Account Roles` tab for the client.\n+You should see the `Dev Team A` realm role assigned.\n+\n+We can now use this configuration with Kafka's CLI tools.\n+\n+\n+### Producing the Messages\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages to topic 'my-topic':\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic my-topic \\\n+  --producer.config=/tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+```\n+\n+When we press `Enter` to push the first message we receive `Not authorized to access topics: [my-topic]` error.\n+\n+`team-a-client` has a `Dev Team A` role which gives it permissions to do anything on topics that start with 'a_', and only write to topics that start with 'x_'.\n+The topic named `my-topic` matches neither of those.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application, and let's try to write to topic `a_messages`.\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+  --producer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+Second message\n+```\n+\n+Although we can see some unrelated warnings, looking at the Kafka container log there is DEBUG level output saying 'Authorization GRANTED'.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application.\n+\n+You can see the Kafka container log by running:\n+\n+    kubectl logs my-cluster-kafka-0 -f\n+\n+### Consuming the Messages\n+\n+Let's now try to consume the messages we have produced.\n+\n+    bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+      --from-beginning --consumer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+\n+This gives us an error like: `Not authorized to access group: console-consumer-55841`.\n+\n+The reason is that we have to override the default consumer group name -

They are usually used to 'tag' users as playing organisational roles and having permissions that pertain to it.\n+In Keycloak the roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider - if that is your requirement then you should use groups instead.\n+\n+Under `Clients` we can see some additional clients configured - `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth2 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth2 client authentication.\n+This client also contains Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client under `Authorization` tab.\n+This tab becomes visible when `Authorization Enabled` is turned on under the `Settings` tab.\n+\n+\n+## Authorization Services - Resources, Authorization Scopes, Policies and Permissions\n+\n+`Keycloak Authorization Services` use several concepts that together take part in defining, and applying access control to resources.\n+\n+`Resources` define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of `authorization scopes` - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+`Policies` define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, the `permissions` tie together specific `resources`, `action scopes` and `policies` to define that 'specific users U can perform certain actions A on the resource R'.\n+\n+You can read more about `Keycloak Authorization Services` on link:https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/index.html[project's web site], but note that the documentation there is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources, whereas here we're using it to protect access to Kafka.\n+\n+If we take a look under the `Resources` sub-tab of `Authorization` tab, we'll see the list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers - patterns in a specific format, that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+The format is quite simple. For example:\n+\n+- `kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*`  ... targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_'\n+\n+If `kafka-cluster:XXX` segment is not present, the specifier targets any cluster.\n+\n+- `Group:x_*` ... targets all consumer groups on any cluster with names starting with 'x_'\n+\n+The possible resource types mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model] (`Topic`, `Group`, `Cluster`, ...).\n+\n+Under `Authorization Scopes` we can see a list of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on resources of different types.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+This list mirrors Kafka permissions and should be the same for any deployment.\n+\n+There is an link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file containing the authorization scopes that can be imported, so that they do not have to be manually entered for every new `Authorization Services` enabled client.\n+In order to import `authorization-scopes.json` into a new client, first make sure the new client is `Authorization Enabled` and saved. Then, click on the `Authorization` tab and use the `Import` to import the file. Afterwards, if you select the `Authorization Scopes` you will see the loaded scopes.\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+Under the `Policies` sub-tab there are filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the Roles, or Groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be programmatically defined using JavaScript where logic can take into account the context of the client session - for example, client ip (that is client ip of the Kafka client).\n+\n+Then, finally, there is the `Permissions` sub-tab, which defines 'role bindings' where `resources`, `authorization scopes` and `policies` are tied together to apply a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Each `permission` definition can have a nice descriptive name which can make it very clear what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+    Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+    Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+## Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties << EOF\n+security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT\n+sasl.mechanism=OAUTHBEARER\n+sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required \\\n+  oauth.client.id=\"team-a-client\" \\\n+  oauth.client.secret=\"team-a-client-secret\" \\\n+  oauth.token.endpoint.uri=\"http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/kafka-authz/protocol/openid-connect/token\" ;\n+sasl.login.callback.handler.class=io.strimzi.kafka.oauth.client.JaasClientOauthLoginCallbackHandler\n+EOF\n+```\n+\n+In the Keycloak Console you can find which roles are assigned to the `team-a-client` service account, by selecting `team-a-client` in the `Clients` section.\n+and then opening the `Service Account Roles` tab for the client.\n+You should see the `Dev Team A` realm role assigned.\n+\n+We can now use this configuration with Kafka's CLI tools.\n+\n+\n+### Producing the Messages\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages to topic 'my-topic':\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic my-topic \\\n+  --producer.config=/tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+```\n+\n+When we press `Enter` to push the first message we receive `Not authorized to access topics: [my-topic]` error.\n+\n+`team-a-client` has a `Dev Team A` role which gives it permissions to do anything on topics that start with 'a_', and only write to topics that start with 'x_'.\n+The topic named `my-topic` matches neither of those.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application, and let's try to write to topic `a_messages`.\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+  --producer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+Second message\n+```\n+\n+Although we can see some unrelated warnings, looking at the Kafka container log there is DEBUG level output saying 'Authorization GRANTED'.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application.\n+\n+You can see the Kafka container log by running:\n+\n+    kubectl logs my-cluster-kafka-0 -f\n+\n+### Consuming the Messages\n+\n+Let's now try to consume the messages we have produced.\n+\n+    bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+      --from-beginning --consumer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+\n+This gives us an error like: `Not authorized to access group: console-consumer-55841`.\n+\n+The reason is that we have to override the default consumer group name -

Because they are refreshed, any changes at Keycloak side are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+## Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/examples/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+\n+    export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/examples\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for the Keycloak\n+\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` but something else (for example, `default`), then use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+    curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+\n+\n+## Using the Keycloak Admin Console to Configure Authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+    kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+\n+Now use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as both a username, and a password.\n+\n+In the upper left corner under the Keycloak icon you should see `Master` selected as the current realm.\n+Moving the mouse pointer over it should reveal two additional realms - `Demo` and `Kafka-authz`.\n+\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Selecting it will open the `Realm Settings` for the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Next to the `Realm Settings` there are other sections we are interested in - `Groups`, `Roles`, `Clients` and `Users`.\n+\n+Under `Groups` we can see several groups that can be used to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with name assigned. Typically they are used to geographically or organisationally compartmentalize users into organisations, organisational units, departments, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make some user a member of some group - through a custom LDAP server admin UI for example, which grants them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under `Users`, click on the `View all users` button and you will see two users defined - `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under `Roles` we can see several realm roles which can be used to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to 'tag' users as playing organisational roles and having permissions that pertain to it.\n+In Keycloak the roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider - if that is your requirement then you should use groups instead.\n+\n+Under `Clients` we can see some additional clients configured - `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth2 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth2 client authentication.\n+This client also contains Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client under `Authorization` tab.\n+This tab becomes visible when `Authorization Enabled` is turned on under the `Settings` tab.\n+\n+\n+## Authorization Services - Resources, Authorization Scopes, Policies and Permissions\n+\n+`Keycloak Authorization Services` use several concepts that together take part in defining, and applying access control to resources.\n+\n+`Resources` define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of `authorization scopes` - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+`Policies` define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, the `permissions` tie together specific `resources`, `action scopes` and `policies` to define that 'specific users U can perform certain actions A on the resource R'.\n+\n+You can read more about `Keycloak Authorization Services` on link:https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/index.html[project's web site], but note that the documentation there is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources, whereas here we're using it to protect access to Kafka.\n+\n+If we take a look under the `Resources` sub-tab of `Authorization` tab, we'll see the list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers - patterns in a specific format, that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+The format is quite simple. For example:\n+\n+- `kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*`  ... targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_'\n+\n+If `kafka-cluster:XXX` segment is not present, the specifier targets any cluster.\n+\n+- `Group:x_*` ... targets all consumer groups on any cluster with names starting with 'x_'\n+\n+The possible resource types mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model] (`Topic`, `Group`, `Cluster`, ...).\n+\n+Under `Authorization Scopes` we can see a list of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on resources of different types.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+This list mirrors Kafka permissions and should be the same for any deployment.\n+\n+There is an link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file containing the authorization scopes that can be imported, so that they do not have to be manually entered for every new `Authorization Services` enabled client.\n+In order to import `authorization-scopes.json` into a new client, first make sure the new client is `Authorization Enabled` and saved. Then, click on the `Authorization` tab and use the `Import` to import the file. Afterwards, if you select the `Authorization Scopes` you will see the loaded scopes.\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+Under the `Policies` sub-tab there are filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the Roles, or Groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be programmatically defined using JavaScript where logic can take into account the context of the client session - for example, client ip (that is client ip of the Kafka client).\n+\n+Then, finally, there is the `Permissions` sub-tab, which defines 'role bindings' where `resources`, `authorization scopes` and `policies` are tied together to apply a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Each `permission` definition can have a nice descriptive name which can make it very clear what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+    Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+    Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively -

Because they are refreshed, any changes at Keycloak side are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+## Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/examples/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+\n+    export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/examples\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for the Keycloak\n+\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` but something else (for example, `default`), then use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+    curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+\n+\n+## Using the Keycloak Admin Console to Configure Authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+    kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+\n+Now use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as both a username, and a password.\n+\n+In the upper left corner under the Keycloak icon you should see `Master` selected as the current realm.\n+Moving the mouse pointer over it should reveal two additional realms - `Demo` and `Kafka-authz`.\n+\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Selecting it will open the `Realm Settings` for the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Next to the `Realm Settings` there are other sections we are interested in - `Groups`, `Roles`, `Clients` and `Users`.\n+\n+Under `Groups` we can see several groups that can be used to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with name assigned. Typically they are used to geographically or organisationally compartmentalize users into organisations, organisational units, departments, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make some user a member of some group - through a custom LDAP server admin UI for example, which grants them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under `Users`, click on the `View all users` button and you will see two users defined - `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under `Roles` we can see several realm roles which can be used to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to 'tag' users as playing organisational roles and having permissions that pertain to it.\n+In Keycloak the roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider - if that is your requirement then you should use groups instead.\n+\n+Under `Clients` we can see some additional clients configured - `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth2 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth2 client authentication.\n+This client also contains Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client under `Authorization` tab.\n+This tab becomes visible when `Authorization Enabled` is turned on under the `Settings` tab.\n+\n+\n+## Authorization Services - Resources, Authorization Scopes, Policies and Permissions\n+\n+`Keycloak Authorization Services` use several concepts that together take part in defining, and applying access control to resources.\n+\n+`Resources` define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of `authorization scopes` - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+`Policies` define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, the `permissions` tie together specific `resources`, `action scopes` and `policies` to define that 'specific users U can perform certain actions A on the resource R'.\n+\n+You can read more about `Keycloak Authorization Services` on link:https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/index.html[project's web site], but note that the documentation there is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources, whereas here we're using it to protect access to Kafka.\n+\n+If we take a look under the `Resources` sub-tab of `Authorization` tab, we'll see the list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers - patterns in a specific format, that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+The format is quite simple. For example:\n+\n+- `kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*`  ... targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_'\n+\n+If `kafka-cluster:XXX` segment is not present, the specifier targets any cluster.\n+\n+- `Group:x_*` ... targets all consumer groups on any cluster with names starting with 'x_'\n+\n+The possible resource types mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model] (`Topic`, `Group`, `Cluster`, ...).\n+\n+Under `Authorization Scopes` we can see a list of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on resources of different types.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+This list mirrors Kafka permissions and should be the same for any deployment.\n+\n+There is an link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file containing the authorization scopes that can be imported, so that they do not have to be manually entered for every new `Authorization Services` enabled client.\n+In order to import `authorization-scopes.json` into a new client, first make sure the new client is `Authorization Enabled` and saved. Then, click on the `Authorization` tab and use the `Import` to import the file. Afterwards, if you select the `Authorization Scopes` you will see the loaded scopes.\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+Under the `Policies` sub-tab there are filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the Roles, or Groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be programmatically defined using JavaScript where logic can take into account the context of the client session - for example, client ip (that is client ip of the Kafka client).\n+\n+Then, finally, there is the `Permissions` sub-tab, which defines 'role bindings' where `resources`, `authorization scopes` and `policies` are tied together to apply a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Each `permission` definition can have a nice descriptive name which can make it very clear what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+    Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+    Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+    ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+## Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties << EOF\n+security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT\n+sasl.mechanism=OAUTHBEARER\n+sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required \\\n+  oauth.client.id=\"team-a-client\" \\\n+  oauth.client.secret=\"team-a-client-secret\" \\\n+  oauth.token.endpoint.uri=\"http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/kafka-authz/protocol/openid-connect/token\" ;\n+sasl.login.callback.handler.class=io.strimzi.kafka.oauth.client.JaasClientOauthLoginCallbackHandler\n+EOF\n+```\n+\n+In the Keycloak Console you can find which roles are assigned to the `team-a-client` service account, by selecting `team-a-client` in the `Clients` section.\n+and then opening the `Service Account Roles` tab for the client.\n+You should see the `Dev Team A` realm role assigned.\n+\n+We can now use this configuration with Kafka's CLI tools.\n+\n+\n+### Producing the Messages\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages to topic 'my-topic':\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic my-topic \\\n+  --producer.config=/tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+```\n+\n+When we press `Enter` to push the first message we receive `Not authorized to access topics: [my-topic]` error.\n+\n+`team-a-client` has a `Dev Team A` role which gives it permissions to do anything on topics that start with 'a_', and only write to topics that start with 'x_'.\n+The topic named `my-topic` matches neither of those.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application, and let's try to write to topic `a_messages`.\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+  --producer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+Second message\n+```\n+\n+Although we can see some unrelated warnings, looking at the Kafka container log there is DEBUG level output saying 'Authorization GRANTED'.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application.\n+\n+You can see the Kafka container log by running:\n+\n+    kubectl logs my-cluster-kafka-0 -f\n+\n+### Consuming the Messages\n+\n+Let's now try to consume the messages we have produced.\n+\n+    bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+      --from-beginning --consumer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+\n+This gives us an error like: `Not authorized to access group: console-consumer-55841`.\n+\n+The reason is that we have to override the default consumer group name -

Typically, they are used to compartmentalize users into geographical, organizational or departmental units, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make a user a member of a group through a custom LDAP server admin user interface, for example, to grant them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under *Users*, when viewing all users you will see two users defined: `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under *Roles*, you can view the realm roles to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to _tag_ users with organizational roles and have the requisite permissions.\n+Roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider. If LDAP is a requirement, you could use groups instead.\n+\n+Under *Clients*, you can view the additional client configurations: `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth 2.0 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth 2.0 client authentication.\n+This client also contains the Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client from the *Authorization* tab, which becomes visible when *Authorization Enabled* is switched on from the *Settings* tab.\n+\n+\n+== Defining Authorization Services for access control\n+\n+Keycloak Authorization Services use authorization scopes, policies and permissions to define and apply access control to resources.\n+\n+Resources define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of authorization scopes - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+Policies define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, permissions tie together the resources, authorization scopes and policies that specify _users U can perform actions A on resource R_.\n+\n+For more information about Keycloak Authorization Services, see {keycloak-authorization-services}, but note that the Authorization Services documentation is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources rather than access to Kafka.\n+\n+When viewing resources from the Keycloak user interface you will see a list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers, patterns in a specific format that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+For example, this pattern targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_':\n+\n+----\n+kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*  \n+---- \n+\n+If a cluster is not specified by name ( `kafka-cluster:cluster-1`), the specifier targets any cluster. For example, this pattern targets any cluster with a name starting  'x_':\n+----\n+Group:x_* \n+----\n+\n+\n+The possible resource types, such as `Topic`, `Group` and `Cluster`, mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model].\n+\n+*Authorization Scopes* lists of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on specific resources.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+The list of actions mirrors Kafka permissions and is the same for any deployment.\n+\n+Rather than importing authorization scopes manually into every new client, you can use a link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file.\n+\n+You must make sure that the client is enabled in Keycloak for Authorization Services. After which, you can import a JSON file from the *Authorization* tab. You can see the loaded scopes from the *Authorization Scopes* page.\n+\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+The *Policies* tab has filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the roles, or groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be defined programmatically using JavaScript so the logic considers the context of the client session, such as the IP of a Kafka client.\n+\n+The *Permissions* tab defines role bindings that associate resources, authorization scopes and policies for applying a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Use a clear, descriptive name for each permission definition so that it is obvious what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+----\n+Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+----\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+== Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties << EOF\n+security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT\n+sasl.mechanism=OAUTHBEARER\n+sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required \\\n+  oauth.client.id=\"team-a-client\" \\\n+  oauth.client.secret=\"team-a-client-secret\" \\\n+  oauth.token.endpoint.uri=\"http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/kafka-authz/protocol/openid-connect/token\" ;\n+sasl.login.callback.handler.class=io.strimzi.kafka.oauth.client.JaasClientOauthLoginCallbackHandler\n+EOF\n+```\n+\n+In the Keycloak Console you can find which roles are assigned to the `team-a-client` service account, by selecting `team-a-client` in the `Clients` section.\n+and then opening the `Service Account Roles` tab for the client.\n+You should see the `Dev Team A` realm role assigned.\n+\n+We can now use this configuration with Kafka's CLI tools.\n+\n+\n+### Producing the Messages\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages to topic 'my-topic':\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic my-topic \\\n+  --producer.config=/tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+```\n+\n+When we press `Enter` to push the first message we receive `Not authorized to access topics: [my-topic]` error.\n+\n+`team-a-client` has a `Dev Team A` role which gives it permissions to do anything on topics that start with 'a_', and only write to topics that start with 'x_'.\n+The topic named `my-topic` matches neither of those.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application, and let's try to write to topic `a_messages`.\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+  --producer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+Second message\n+```\n+\n+Although we can see some unrelated warnings, looking at the Kafka container log there is DEBUG level output saying 'Authorization GRANTED'.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application.\n+\n+You can see the Kafka container log by running:\n+\n+    kubectl logs my-cluster-kafka-0 -f\n+\n+### Consuming the Messages\n+\n+Let's now try to consume the messages we have produced.\n+\n+    bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+      --from-beginning --consumer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+\n+This gives us an error like: `Not authorized to access group: console-consumer-55841`.\n+\n+The reason is that we have to override the default consumer group name -

Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, permissions tie together the resources, authorization scopes and policies that specify _users U can perform actions A on resource R_.\n+\n+For more information about Keycloak Authorization Services, see {keycloak-authorization-services}, but note that the Authorization Services documentation is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources rather than access to Kafka.\n+\n+When viewing resources from the Keycloak user interface you will see a list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers, patterns in a specific format that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+For example, this pattern targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_':\n+\n+----\n+kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*  \n+---- \n+\n+If a cluster is not specified by name ( `kafka-cluster:cluster-1`), the specifier targets any cluster. For example, this pattern targets any cluster with a name starting  'x_':\n+----\n+Group:x_* \n+----\n+\n+\n+The possible resource types, such as `Topic`, `Group` and `Cluster`, mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model].\n+\n+*Authorization Scopes* lists of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on specific resources.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+The list of actions mirrors Kafka permissions and is the same for any deployment.\n+\n+Rather than importing authorization scopes manually into every new client, you can use a link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file.\n+\n+You must make sure that the client is enabled in Keycloak for Authorization Services. After which, you can import a JSON file from the *Authorization* tab. You can see the loaded scopes from the *Authorization Scopes* page.\n+\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+The *Policies* tab has filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the roles, or groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be defined programmatically using JavaScript so the logic considers the context of the client session, such as the IP of a Kafka client.\n+\n+The *Permissions* tab defines role bindings that associate resources, authorization scopes and policies for applying a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Use a clear, descriptive name for each permission definition so that it is obvious what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+----\n+Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+----\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+== Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties << EOF\n+security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT\n+sasl.mechanism=OAUTHBEARER\n+sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required \\\n+  oauth.client.id=\"team-a-client\" \\\n+  oauth.client.secret=\"team-a-client-secret\" \\\n+  oauth.token.endpoint.uri=\"http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/kafka-authz/protocol/openid-connect/token\" ;\n+sasl.login.callback.handler.class=io.strimzi.kafka.oauth.client.JaasClientOauthLoginCallbackHandler\n+EOF\n+```\n+\n+In the Keycloak Console you can find which roles are assigned to the `team-a-client` service account, by selecting `team-a-client` in the `Clients` section.\n+and then opening the `Service Account Roles` tab for the client.\n+You should see the `Dev Team A` realm role assigned.\n+\n+We can now use this configuration with Kafka's CLI tools.\n+\n+\n+### Producing the Messages\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages to topic 'my-topic':\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic my-topic \\\n+  --producer.config=/tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+```\n+\n+When we press `Enter` to push the first message we receive `Not authorized to access topics: [my-topic]` error.\n+\n+`team-a-client` has a `Dev Team A` role which gives it permissions to do anything on topics that start with 'a_', and only write to topics that start with 'x_'.\n+The topic named `my-topic` matches neither of those.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application, and let's try to write to topic `a_messages`.\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+  --producer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+Second message\n+```\n+\n+Although we can see some unrelated warnings, looking at the Kafka container log there is DEBUG level output saying 'Authorization GRANTED'.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application.\n+\n+You can see the Kafka container log by running:\n+\n+    kubectl logs my-cluster-kafka-0 -f\n+\n+### Consuming the Messages\n+\n+Let's now try to consume the messages we have produced.\n+\n+    bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+      --from-beginning --consumer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+\n+This gives us an error like: `Not authorized to access group: console-consumer-55841`.\n+\n+The reason is that we have to override the default consumer group name -

   --entity-type brokers --describe --entity-default\n+\n+But that will fail with `Cluster authorization failed.` error, because this operation requires cluster level permissions which `team-a-client` does not have.\n+\n+\n+### Client with Different Permissions\n+\n+Let's prepare a configuration for `team-b-client`:", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid":

con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-authorization-services.adoc\n+\n+[id='con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-example_{context}']\n+= Example authorization rules configuration using Authorization Services\n+\n+This is an end-to-end example of using Keycloak Authorization Services to configure authorization rules for use with `keycloak` authorization in Strimzi.\n+The example starts by deploying the Keycloak server with pre-configured realms, requiring no additional configuration.\n+We deploy the Kafka cluster configured to use one of the pre-configured realms.\n+We connect to the Keycloak Admin Console and demonstrate the sections of the user interface where authorizations rules are configured.\n+We use Kafka CLI client tools with different personal and service accounts to demonstrate limited access based on the permissions granted to different accounts.\n+\n+\n+== Token Based Authorization with Keycloak Authorization Services\n+\n+Once the Kafka Broker has obtained an access token by using `oauth` authentication, it is possible to use centrally managed authorization rules to enforce access restrictions onto Kafka Clients.\n+For this, Strimzi Kafka Operator comes with `keycloak` authorization which uses Keycloak Authorization Services to centrally manage permissions.\n+\n+When using `keycloak` authorization a custom authorizer is configured on the Kafka Broker that uses Authorization Services REST endpoints available on Keycloak, which provide a list of granted permissions on resources for authenticated users.\n+The list of grants (permissions) is fetched as the first action after an authenticated session is established by the Kafka client, and then regularly refreshed in the background.\n+Grants are cached and enforced locally on the Kafka Broker for each user session to provide fast authorization decisions. Because they are refreshed, any changes to the grants on the Keycloak server are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+== Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/examples/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/examples\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for Keycloak\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` (for example, `default`), use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+----\n+\n+\n+== Using the Keycloak Admin Console to configure authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+----\n+\n+Use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as username and password.\n+\n+In the upper left corner under the Keycloak icon you should see `Master` selected as the current realm.\n+Moving the mouse pointer over it should reveal two additional realms - `Demo` and `Kafka-authz`.\n+\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Selecting it will open the `Realm Settings` for the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+From the *Realm Settings* you can navigate to  *Groups*, *Roles*, *Clients* and *Users*.\n+\n+Under *Groups*, you can view groups to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with a name assigned. Typically, they are used to compartmentalize users into geographical, organizational or departmental units, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make a user a member of a group through a custom LDAP server admin user interface, for example, to grant them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under *Users*, when viewing all users you will see two users defined: `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under *Roles*, you can view the realm roles to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to _tag_ users with organizational roles and have the requisite permissions.\n+Roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider. If LDAP is a requirement, you could use groups instead.\n+\n+Under *Clients*, you can view the additional client configurations: `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth 2.0 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth 2.0 client authentication.\n+This client also contains the Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client from the *Authorization* tab, which becomes visible when *Authorization Enabled* is switched on from the *Settings* tab.\n+\n+\n+== Defining Authorization Services for access control\n+\n+Keycloak Authorization Services use authorization scopes, policies and permissions to define and apply access control to resources.\n+\n+Resources define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of authorization scopes - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+Policies define the groups of users we want to target with permissions.

Because they are refreshed, any changes to the grants on the Keycloak server are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+== Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/examples/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/examples\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for Keycloak\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` (for example, `default`), use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+----\n+\n+\n+== Using the Keycloak Admin Console to configure authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+----\n+\n+Use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as username and password.\n+\n+In the upper left corner under the Keycloak icon you should see `Master` selected as the current realm.\n+Moving the mouse pointer over it should reveal two additional realms - `Demo` and `Kafka-authz`.\n+\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Selecting it will open the `Realm Settings` for the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+From the *Realm Settings* you can navigate to  *Groups*, *Roles*, *Clients* and *Users*.\n+\n+Under *Groups*, you can view groups to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with a name assigned. Typically, they are used to compartmentalize users into geographical, organizational or departmental units, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make a user a member of a group through a custom LDAP server admin user interface, for example, to grant them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under *Users*, when viewing all users you will see two users defined: `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under *Roles*, you can view the realm roles to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to _tag_ users with organizational roles and have the requisite permissions.\n+Roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider. If LDAP is a requirement, you could use groups instead.\n+\n+Under *Clients*, you can view the additional client configurations: `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth 2.0 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth 2.0 client authentication.\n+This client also contains the Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client from the *Authorization* tab, which becomes visible when *Authorization Enabled* is switched on from the *Settings* tab.\n+\n+\n+== Defining Authorization Services for access control\n+\n+Keycloak Authorization Services use authorization scopes, policies and permissions to define and apply access control to resources.\n+\n+Resources define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of authorization scopes - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+Policies define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, permissions tie together the resources, authorization scopes and policies that specify _users U can perform actions A on resource R_.\n+\n+For more information about Keycloak Authorization Services, see {keycloak-authorization-services}, but note that the Authorization Services documentation is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources rather than access to Kafka.\n+\n+When viewing resources from the Keycloak user interface you will see a list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers, patterns in a specific format that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+For example, this pattern targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_':\n+\n+----\n+kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*  \n+---- \n+\n+If a cluster is not specified by name ( `kafka-cluster:cluster-1`), the specifier targets any cluster. For example, this pattern targets any cluster with a name starting  'x_':\n+----\n+Group:x_* \n+----\n+\n+\n+The possible resource types, such as `Topic`, `Group` and `Cluster`, mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model].\n+\n+*Authorization Scopes* lists of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on specific resources.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+The list of actions mirrors Kafka permissions and is the same for any deployment.\n+\n+Rather than importing authorization scopes manually into every new client, you can use a link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file.\n+\n+You must make sure that the client is enabled in Keycloak for Authorization Services. After which, you can import a JSON file from the *Authorization* tab. You can see the loaded scopes from the *Authorization Scopes* page.\n+\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+The *Policies* tab has filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the roles, or groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be defined programmatically using JavaScript so the logic considers the context of the client session, such as the IP of a Kafka client.\n+\n+The *Permissions* tab defines role bindings that associate resources, authorization scopes and policies for applying a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Use a clear, descriptive name for each permission definition so that it is obvious what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+----\n+Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+----\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users -

con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-authorization-services.adoc\n+\n+[id='con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-example_{context}']\n+= Example authorization rules configuration using Authorization Services\n+\n+This is an end-to-end example of using Keycloak Authorization Services to configure authorization rules for use with `keycloak` authorization in Strimzi.\n+The example starts by deploying the Keycloak server with pre-configured realms, requiring no additional configuration.\n+We deploy the Kafka cluster configured to use one of the pre-configured realms.\n+We connect to the Keycloak Admin Console and demonstrate the sections of the user interface where authorizations rules are configured.\n+We use Kafka CLI client tools with different personal and service accounts to demonstrate limited access based on the permissions granted to different accounts.\n+\n+\n+== Token Based Authorization with Keycloak Authorization Services\n+\n+Once the Kafka Broker has obtained an access token by using `oauth` authentication, it is possible to use centrally managed authorization rules to enforce access restrictions onto Kafka Clients.\n+For this, Strimzi Kafka Operator comes with `keycloak` authorization which uses Keycloak Authorization Services to centrally manage permissions.\n+\n+When using `keycloak` authorization a custom authorizer is configured on the Kafka Broker that uses Authorization Services REST endpoints available on Keycloak, which provide a list of granted permissions on resources for authenticated users.\n+The list of grants (permissions) is fetched as the first action after an authenticated session is established by the Kafka client, and then regularly refreshed in the background.\n+Grants are cached and enforced locally on the Kafka Broker for each user session to provide fast authorization decisions. Because they are refreshed, any changes to the grants on the Keycloak server are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+== Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/examples/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/examples\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for Keycloak\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` (for example, `default`), use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+----\n+\n+\n+== Using the Keycloak Admin Console to configure authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+----\n+\n+Use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as username and password.\n+\n+In the upper left corner under the Keycloak icon you should see `Master` selected as the current realm.\n+Moving the mouse pointer over it should reveal two additional realms - `Demo` and `Kafka-authz`.\n+\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Selecting it will open the `Realm Settings` for the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+From the *Realm Settings* you can navigate to  *Groups*, *Roles*, *Clients* and *Users*.\n+\n+Under *Groups*, you can view groups to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with a name assigned. Typically, they are used to compartmentalize users into geographical, organizational or departmental units, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make a user a member of a group through a custom LDAP server admin user interface, for example, to grant them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under *Users*, when viewing all users you will see two users defined: `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under *Roles*, you can view the realm roles to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to _tag_ users with organizational roles and have the requisite permissions.\n+Roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider. If LDAP is a requirement, you could use groups instead.\n+\n+Under *Clients*, you can view the additional client configurations: `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth 2.0 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth 2.0 client authentication.\n+This client also contains the Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client from the *Authorization* tab, which becomes visible when *Authorization Enabled* is switched on from the *Settings* tab.\n+\n+\n+== Defining Authorization Services for access control\n+\n+Keycloak Authorization Services use authorization scopes, policies and permissions to define and apply access control to resources.\n+\n+Resources define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of authorization scopes - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+Policies define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, permissions tie together the resources, authorization scopes and policies that specify _users U can perform actions A on resource R_.\n+\n+For more information about Keycloak Authorization Services, see {keycloak-authorization-services}, but note that the Authorization Services documentation is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources rather than access to Kafka.\n+\n+When viewing resources from the Keycloak user interface you will see a list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers, patterns in a specific format that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+For example, this pattern targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_':\n+\n+----\n+kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*  \n+---- \n+\n+If a cluster is not specified by name ( `kafka-cluster:cluster-1`), the specifier targets any cluster. For example, this pattern targets any cluster with a name starting  'x_':\n+----\n+Group:x_* \n+----\n+\n+\n+The possible resource types, such as `Topic`, `Group` and `Cluster`, mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model].\n+\n+*Authorization Scopes* lists of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on specific resources.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+The list of actions mirrors Kafka permissions and is the same for any deployment.\n+\n+Rather than importing authorization scopes manually into every new client, you can use a link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file.\n+\n+You must make sure that the client is enabled in Keycloak for Authorization Services. After which, you can import a JSON file from the *Authorization* tab. You can see the loaded scopes from the *Authorization Scopes* page.\n+\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+The *Policies* tab has filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the roles, or groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be defined programmatically using JavaScript so the logic considers the context of the client session, such as the IP of a Kafka client.\n+\n+The *Permissions* tab defines role bindings that associate resources, authorization scopes and policies for applying a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Use a clear, descriptive name for each permission definition so that it is obvious what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+----\n+Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+----\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+== Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties << EOF\n+security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT\n+sasl.mechanism=OAUTHBEARER\n+sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required \\\n+  oauth.client.id=\"team-a-client\" \\\n+  oauth.client.secret=\"team-a-client-secret\" \\\n+  oauth.token.endpoint.uri=\"http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/kafka-authz/protocol/openid-connect/token\" ;\n+sasl.login.callback.handler.class=io.strimzi.kafka.oauth.client.JaasClientOauthLoginCallbackHandler\n+EOF\n+```\n+\n+In the Keycloak Console you can find which roles are assigned to the `team-a-client` service account, by selecting `team-a-client` in the `Clients` section.\n+and then opening the `Service Account Roles` tab for the client.\n+You should see the `Dev Team A` realm role assigned.\n+\n+We can now use this configuration with Kafka's CLI tools.\n+\n+\n+### Producing the Messages\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages to topic 'my-topic':\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic my-topic \\\n+  --producer.config=/tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+```\n+\n+When we press `Enter` to push the first message we receive `Not authorized to access topics: [my-topic]` error.\n+\n+`team-a-client` has a `Dev Team A` role which gives it permissions to do anything on topics that start with 'a_', and only write to topics that start with 'x_'.\n+The topic named `my-topic` matches neither of those.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application, and let's try to write to topic `a_messages`.\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+  --producer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+Second message\n+```\n+\n+Although we can see some unrelated warnings, looking at the Kafka container log there is DEBUG level output saying 'Authorization GRANTED'.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application.\n+\n+You can see the Kafka container log by running:\n+\n+    kubectl logs my-cluster-kafka-0 -f\n+\n+### Consuming the Messages\n+\n+Let's now try to consume the messages we have produced.\n+\n+    bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+      --from-beginning --consumer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+\n+This gives us an error like: `Not authorized to access group: console-consumer-55841`.\n+\n+The reason is that we have to override the default consumer group name -

Because they are refreshed, any changes to the grants on the Keycloak server are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+== Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/examples/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/examples\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for Keycloak\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` (for example, `default`), use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+----\n+\n+\n+== Using the Keycloak Admin Console to configure authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+----\n+\n+Use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as username and password.\n+\n+In the upper left corner under the Keycloak icon you should see `Master` selected as the current realm.\n+Moving the mouse pointer over it should reveal two additional realms - `Demo` and `Kafka-authz`.\n+\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Selecting it will open the `Realm Settings` for the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+From the *Realm Settings* you can navigate to  *Groups*, *Roles*, *Clients* and *Users*.\n+\n+Under *Groups*, you can view groups to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with a name assigned. Typically, they are used to compartmentalize users into geographical, organizational or departmental units, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make a user a member of a group through a custom LDAP server admin user interface, for example, to grant them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under *Users*, when viewing all users you will see two users defined: `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under *Roles*, you can view the realm roles to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to _tag_ users with organizational roles and have the requisite permissions.\n+Roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider. If LDAP is a requirement, you could use groups instead.\n+\n+Under *Clients*, you can view the additional client configurations: `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth 2.0 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth 2.0 client authentication.\n+This client also contains the Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client from the *Authorization* tab, which becomes visible when *Authorization Enabled* is switched on from the *Settings* tab.\n+\n+\n+== Defining Authorization Services for access control\n+\n+Keycloak Authorization Services use authorization scopes, policies and permissions to define and apply access control to resources.\n+\n+Resources define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of authorization scopes - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+Policies define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, permissions tie together the resources, authorization scopes and policies that specify _users U can perform actions A on resource R_.\n+\n+For more information about Keycloak Authorization Services, see {keycloak-authorization-services}, but note that the Authorization Services documentation is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources rather than access to Kafka.\n+\n+When viewing resources from the Keycloak user interface you will see a list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers, patterns in a specific format that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+For example, this pattern targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_':\n+\n+----\n+kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*  \n+---- \n+\n+If a cluster is not specified by name ( `kafka-cluster:cluster-1`), the specifier targets any cluster. For example, this pattern targets any cluster with a name starting  'x_':\n+----\n+Group:x_* \n+----\n+\n+\n+The possible resource types, such as `Topic`, `Group` and `Cluster`, mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model].\n+\n+*Authorization Scopes* lists of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on specific resources.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+The list of actions mirrors Kafka permissions and is the same for any deployment.\n+\n+Rather than importing authorization scopes manually into every new client, you can use a link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file.\n+\n+You must make sure that the client is enabled in Keycloak for Authorization Services. After which, you can import a JSON file from the *Authorization* tab. You can see the loaded scopes from the *Authorization Scopes* page.\n+\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+The *Policies* tab has filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the roles, or groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be defined programmatically using JavaScript so the logic considers the context of the client session, such as the IP of a Kafka client.\n+\n+The *Permissions* tab defines role bindings that associate resources, authorization scopes and policies for applying a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Use a clear, descriptive name for each permission definition so that it is obvious what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+----\n+Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+----\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+== Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties << EOF\n+security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT\n+sasl.mechanism=OAUTHBEARER\n+sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required \\\n+  oauth.client.id=\"team-a-client\" \\\n+  oauth.client.secret=\"team-a-client-secret\" \\\n+  oauth.token.endpoint.uri=\"http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/kafka-authz/protocol/openid-connect/token\" ;\n+sasl.login.callback.handler.class=io.strimzi.kafka.oauth.client.JaasClientOauthLoginCallbackHandler\n+EOF\n+```\n+\n+In the Keycloak Console you can find which roles are assigned to the `team-a-client` service account, by selecting `team-a-client` in the `Clients` section.\n+and then opening the `Service Account Roles` tab for the client.\n+You should see the `Dev Team A` realm role assigned.\n+\n+We can now use this configuration with Kafka's CLI tools.\n+\n+\n+### Producing the Messages\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages to topic 'my-topic':\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic my-topic \\\n+  --producer.config=/tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+```\n+\n+When we press `Enter` to push the first message we receive `Not authorized to access topics: [my-topic]` error.\n+\n+`team-a-client` has a `Dev Team A` role which gives it permissions to do anything on topics that start with 'a_', and only write to topics that start with 'x_'.\n+The topic named `my-topic` matches neither of those.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application, and let's try to write to topic `a_messages`.\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+  --producer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+Second message\n+```\n+\n+Although we can see some unrelated warnings, looking at the Kafka container log there is DEBUG level output saying 'Authorization GRANTED'.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application.\n+\n+You can see the Kafka container log by running:\n+\n+    kubectl logs my-cluster-kafka-0 -f\n+\n+### Consuming the Messages\n+\n+Let's now try to consume the messages we have produced.\n+\n+    bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+      --from-beginning --consumer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+\n+This gives us an error like: `Not authorized to access group: console-consumer-55841`.\n+\n+The reason is that we have to override the default consumer group name -

Because they are refreshed, any changes to the grants on the Keycloak server are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+== Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/examples/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/examples\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for Keycloak\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` (for example, `default`), use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+----\n+\n+\n+== Using the Keycloak Admin Console to configure authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+----\n+\n+Use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as username and password.\n+\n+In the upper left corner under the Keycloak icon you should see `Master` selected as the current realm.\n+Moving the mouse pointer over it should reveal two additional realms - `Demo` and `Kafka-authz`.\n+\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Selecting it will open the `Realm Settings` for the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+From the *Realm Settings* you can navigate to  *Groups*, *Roles*, *Clients* and *Users*.\n+\n+Under *Groups*, you can view groups to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with a name assigned. Typically, they are used to compartmentalize users into geographical, organizational or departmental units, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make a user a member of a group through a custom LDAP server admin user interface, for example, to grant them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under *Users*, when viewing all users you will see two users defined: `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under *Roles*, you can view the realm roles to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to _tag_ users with organizational roles and have the requisite permissions.\n+Roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider. If LDAP is a requirement, you could use groups instead.\n+\n+Under *Clients*, you can view the additional client configurations: `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth 2.0 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth 2.0 client authentication.\n+This client also contains the Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client from the *Authorization* tab, which becomes visible when *Authorization Enabled* is switched on from the *Settings* tab.\n+\n+\n+== Defining Authorization Services for access control\n+\n+Keycloak Authorization Services use authorization scopes, policies and permissions to define and apply access control to resources.\n+\n+Resources define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of authorization scopes - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+Policies define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, permissions tie together the resources, authorization scopes and policies that specify _users U can perform actions A on resource R_.\n+\n+For more information about Keycloak Authorization Services, see {keycloak-authorization-services}, but note that the Authorization Services documentation is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources rather than access to Kafka.\n+\n+When viewing resources from the Keycloak user interface you will see a list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers, patterns in a specific format that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+For example, this pattern targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_':\n+\n+----\n+kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*  \n+---- \n+\n+If a cluster is not specified by name ( `kafka-cluster:cluster-1`), the specifier targets any cluster. For example, this pattern targets any cluster with a name starting  'x_':\n+----\n+Group:x_* \n+----\n+\n+\n+The possible resource types, such as `Topic`, `Group` and `Cluster`, mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model].\n+\n+*Authorization Scopes* lists of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on specific resources.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+The list of actions mirrors Kafka permissions and is the same for any deployment.\n+\n+Rather than importing authorization scopes manually into every new client, you can use a link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file.\n+\n+You must make sure that the client is enabled in Keycloak for Authorization Services. After which, you can import a JSON file from the *Authorization* tab. You can see the loaded scopes from the *Authorization Scopes* page.\n+\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+The *Policies* tab has filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the roles, or groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be defined programmatically using JavaScript so the logic considers the context of the client session, such as the IP of a Kafka client.\n+\n+The *Permissions* tab defines role bindings that associate resources, authorization scopes and policies for applying a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Use a clear, descriptive name for each permission definition so that it is obvious what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+----\n+Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+----\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+== Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties << EOF\n+security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT\n+sasl.mechanism=OAUTHBEARER\n+sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required \\\n+  oauth.client.id=\"team-a-client\" \\\n+  oauth.client.secret=\"team-a-client-secret\" \\\n+  oauth.token.endpoint.uri=\"http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/kafka-authz/protocol/openid-connect/token\" ;\n+sasl.login.callback.handler.class=io.strimzi.kafka.oauth.client.JaasClientOauthLoginCallbackHandler\n+EOF\n+```\n+\n+In the Keycloak Console you can find which roles are assigned to the `team-a-client` service account, by selecting `team-a-client` in the `Clients` section.\n+and then opening the `Service Account Roles` tab for the client.\n+You should see the `Dev Team A` realm role assigned.\n+\n+We can now use this configuration with Kafka's CLI tools.\n+\n+\n+### Producing the Messages\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages to topic 'my-topic':\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic my-topic \\\n+  --producer.config=/tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+```\n+\n+When we press `Enter` to push the first message we receive `Not authorized to access topics: [my-topic]` error.\n+\n+`team-a-client` has a `Dev Team A` role which gives it permissions to do anything on topics that start with 'a_', and only write to topics that start with 'x_'.\n+The topic named `my-topic` matches neither of those.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application, and let's try to write to topic `a_messages`.\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+  --producer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+Second message\n+```\n+\n+Although we can see some unrelated warnings, looking at the Kafka container log there is DEBUG level output saying 'Authorization GRANTED'.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application.\n+\n+You can see the Kafka container log by running:\n+\n+    kubectl logs my-cluster-kafka-0 -f\n+\n+### Consuming the Messages\n+\n+Let's now try to consume the messages we have produced.\n+\n+    bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+      --from-beginning --consumer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+\n+This gives us an error like: `Not authorized to access group: console-consumer-55841`.\n+\n+The reason is that we have to override the default consumer group name -

Because they are refreshed, any changes to the grants on the Keycloak server are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+== Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/examples/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/examples\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for Keycloak\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` (for example, `default`), use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+----\n+\n+\n+== Using the Keycloak Admin Console to configure authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+----\n+\n+Use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as username and password.\n+\n+In the upper left corner under the Keycloak icon you should see `Master` selected as the current realm.\n+Moving the mouse pointer over it should reveal two additional realms - `Demo` and `Kafka-authz`.\n+\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Selecting it will open the `Realm Settings` for the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+From the *Realm Settings* you can navigate to  *Groups*, *Roles*, *Clients* and *Users*.\n+\n+Under *Groups*, you can view groups to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with a name assigned. Typically, they are used to compartmentalize users into geographical, organizational or departmental units, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make a user a member of a group through a custom LDAP server admin user interface, for example, to grant them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under *Users*, when viewing all users you will see two users defined: `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under *Roles*, you can view the realm roles to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to _tag_ users with organizational roles and have the requisite permissions.\n+Roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider. If LDAP is a requirement, you could use groups instead.\n+\n+Under *Clients*, you can view the additional client configurations: `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth 2.0 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth 2.0 client authentication.\n+This client also contains the Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client from the *Authorization* tab, which becomes visible when *Authorization Enabled* is switched on from the *Settings* tab.\n+\n+\n+== Defining Authorization Services for access control\n+\n+Keycloak Authorization Services use authorization scopes, policies and permissions to define and apply access control to resources.\n+\n+Resources define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of authorization scopes - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+Policies define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, permissions tie together the resources, authorization scopes and policies that specify _users U can perform actions A on resource R_.\n+\n+For more information about Keycloak Authorization Services, see {keycloak-authorization-services}, but note that the Authorization Services documentation is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources rather than access to Kafka.\n+\n+When viewing resources from the Keycloak user interface you will see a list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers, patterns in a specific format that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+For example, this pattern targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_':\n+\n+----\n+kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*  \n+---- \n+\n+If a cluster is not specified by name ( `kafka-cluster:cluster-1`), the specifier targets any cluster. For example, this pattern targets any cluster with a name starting  'x_':\n+----\n+Group:x_* \n+----\n+\n+\n+The possible resource types, such as `Topic`, `Group` and `Cluster`, mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model].\n+\n+*Authorization Scopes* lists of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on specific resources.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+The list of actions mirrors Kafka permissions and is the same for any deployment.\n+\n+Rather than importing authorization scopes manually into every new client, you can use a link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file.\n+\n+You must make sure that the client is enabled in Keycloak for Authorization Services. After which, you can import a JSON file from the *Authorization* tab. You can see the loaded scopes from the *Authorization Scopes* page.\n+\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+The *Policies* tab has filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the roles, or groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be defined programmatically using JavaScript so the logic considers the context of the client session, such as the IP of a Kafka client.\n+\n+The *Permissions* tab defines role bindings that associate resources, authorization scopes and policies for applying a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Use a clear, descriptive name for each permission definition so that it is obvious what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+----\n+Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+----\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+== Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties << EOF\n+security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT\n+sasl.mechanism=OAUTHBEARER\n+sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required \\\n+  oauth.client.id=\"team-a-client\" \\\n+  oauth.client.secret=\"team-a-client-secret\" \\\n+  oauth.token.endpoint.uri=\"http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/kafka-authz/protocol/openid-connect/token\" ;\n+sasl.login.callback.handler.class=io.strimzi.kafka.oauth.client.JaasClientOauthLoginCallbackHandler\n+EOF\n+```\n+\n+In the Keycloak Console you can find which roles are assigned to the `team-a-client` service account, by selecting `team-a-client` in the `Clients` section.\n+and then opening the `Service Account Roles` tab for the client.\n+You should see the `Dev Team A` realm role assigned.\n+\n+We can now use this configuration with Kafka's CLI tools.\n+\n+\n+### Producing the Messages\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages to topic 'my-topic':\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic my-topic \\\n+  --producer.config=/tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+```\n+\n+When we press `Enter` to push the first message we receive `Not authorized to access topics: [my-topic]` error.\n+\n+`team-a-client` has a `Dev Team A` role which gives it permissions to do anything on topics that start with 'a_', and only write to topics that start with 'x_'.\n+The topic named `my-topic` matches neither of those.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application, and let's try to write to topic `a_messages`.\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+  --producer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+Second message\n+```\n+\n+Although we can see some unrelated warnings, looking at the Kafka container log there is DEBUG level output saying 'Authorization GRANTED'.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application.\n+\n+You can see the Kafka container log by running:\n+\n+    kubectl logs my-cluster-kafka-0 -f\n+\n+### Consuming the Messages\n+\n+Let's now try to consume the messages we have produced.\n+\n+    bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+      --from-beginning --consumer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+\n+This gives us an error like: `Not authorized to access group: console-consumer-55841`.\n+\n+The reason is that we have to override the default consumer group name -

Because they are refreshed, any changes to the grants on the Keycloak server are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+== Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/examples/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/examples\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for Keycloak\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` (for example, `default`), use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+----\n+\n+\n+== Using the Keycloak Admin Console to configure authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+----\n+\n+Use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as username and password.\n+\n+In the upper left corner under the Keycloak icon you should see `Master` selected as the current realm.\n+Moving the mouse pointer over it should reveal two additional realms - `Demo` and `Kafka-authz`.\n+\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Selecting it will open the `Realm Settings` for the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+From the *Realm Settings* you can navigate to  *Groups*, *Roles*, *Clients* and *Users*.\n+\n+Under *Groups*, you can view groups to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with a name assigned. Typically, they are used to compartmentalize users into geographical, organizational or departmental units, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make a user a member of a group through a custom LDAP server admin user interface, for example, to grant them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under *Users*, when viewing all users you will see two users defined: `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under *Roles*, you can view the realm roles to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to _tag_ users with organizational roles and have the requisite permissions.\n+Roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider. If LDAP is a requirement, you could use groups instead.\n+\n+Under *Clients*, you can view the additional client configurations: `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth 2.0 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth 2.0 client authentication.\n+This client also contains the Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client from the *Authorization* tab, which becomes visible when *Authorization Enabled* is switched on from the *Settings* tab.\n+\n+\n+== Defining Authorization Services for access control\n+\n+Keycloak Authorization Services use authorization scopes, policies and permissions to define and apply access control to resources.\n+\n+Resources define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of authorization scopes - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+Policies define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, permissions tie together the resources, authorization scopes and policies that specify _users U can perform actions A on resource R_.\n+\n+For more information about Keycloak Authorization Services, see {keycloak-authorization-services}, but note that the Authorization Services documentation is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources rather than access to Kafka.\n+\n+When viewing resources from the Keycloak user interface you will see a list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers, patterns in a specific format that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+For example, this pattern targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_':\n+\n+----\n+kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*  \n+---- \n+\n+If a cluster is not specified by name ( `kafka-cluster:cluster-1`), the specifier targets any cluster. For example, this pattern targets any cluster with a name starting  'x_':\n+----\n+Group:x_* \n+----\n+\n+\n+The possible resource types, such as `Topic`, `Group` and `Cluster`, mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model].\n+\n+*Authorization Scopes* lists of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on specific resources.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+The list of actions mirrors Kafka permissions and is the same for any deployment.\n+\n+Rather than importing authorization scopes manually into every new client, you can use a link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file.\n+\n+You must make sure that the client is enabled in Keycloak for Authorization Services. After which, you can import a JSON file from the *Authorization* tab. You can see the loaded scopes from the *Authorization Scopes* page.\n+\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+The *Policies* tab has filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the roles, or groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be defined programmatically using JavaScript so the logic considers the context of the client session, such as the IP of a Kafka client.\n+\n+The *Permissions* tab defines role bindings that associate resources, authorization scopes and policies for applying a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Use a clear, descriptive name for each permission definition so that it is obvious what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+----\n+Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+----\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+== Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties << EOF\n+security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT\n+sasl.mechanism=OAUTHBEARER\n+sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required \\\n+  oauth.client.id=\"team-a-client\" \\\n+  oauth.client.secret=\"team-a-client-secret\" \\\n+  oauth.token.endpoint.uri=\"http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/kafka-authz/protocol/openid-connect/token\" ;\n+sasl.login.callback.handler.class=io.strimzi.kafka.oauth.client.JaasClientOauthLoginCallbackHandler\n+EOF\n+```\n+\n+In the Keycloak Console you can find which roles are assigned to the `team-a-client` service account, by selecting `team-a-client` in the `Clients` section.\n+and then opening the `Service Account Roles` tab for the client.\n+You should see the `Dev Team A` realm role assigned.\n+\n+We can now use this configuration with Kafka's CLI tools.\n+\n+\n+### Producing the Messages\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages to topic 'my-topic':\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic my-topic \\\n+  --producer.config=/tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+```\n+\n+When we press `Enter` to push the first message we receive `Not authorized to access topics: [my-topic]` error.\n+\n+`team-a-client` has a `Dev Team A` role which gives it permissions to do anything on topics that start with 'a_', and only write to topics that start with 'x_'.\n+The topic named `my-topic` matches neither of those.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application, and let's try to write to topic `a_messages`.\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+  --producer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+Second message\n+```\n+\n+Although we can see some unrelated warnings, looking at the Kafka container log there is DEBUG level output saying 'Authorization GRANTED'.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application.\n+\n+You can see the Kafka container log by running:\n+\n+    kubectl logs my-cluster-kafka-0 -f\n+\n+### Consuming the Messages\n+\n+Let's now try to consume the messages we have produced.\n+\n+    bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+      --from-beginning --consumer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+\n+This gives us an error like: `Not authorized to access group: console-consumer-55841`.\n+\n+The reason is that we have to override the default consumer group name -

Because they are refreshed, any changes to the grants on the Keycloak server are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+== Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/examples/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/examples\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for Keycloak\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` (for example, `default`), use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+----\n+\n+\n+== Using the Keycloak Admin Console to configure authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+----\n+\n+Use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as username and password.\n+\n+In the upper left corner under the Keycloak icon you should see `Master` selected as the current realm.\n+Moving the mouse pointer over it should reveal two additional realms - `Demo` and `Kafka-authz`.\n+\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Selecting it will open the `Realm Settings` for the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+From the *Realm Settings* you can navigate to  *Groups*, *Roles*, *Clients* and *Users*.\n+\n+Under *Groups*, you can view groups to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with a name assigned. Typically, they are used to compartmentalize users into geographical, organizational or departmental units, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make a user a member of a group through a custom LDAP server admin user interface, for example, to grant them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under *Users*, when viewing all users you will see two users defined: `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under *Roles*, you can view the realm roles to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to _tag_ users with organizational roles and have the requisite permissions.\n+Roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider. If LDAP is a requirement, you could use groups instead.\n+\n+Under *Clients*, you can view the additional client configurations: `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth 2.0 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth 2.0 client authentication.\n+This client also contains the Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client from the *Authorization* tab, which becomes visible when *Authorization Enabled* is switched on from the *Settings* tab.\n+\n+\n+== Defining Authorization Services for access control\n+\n+Keycloak Authorization Services use authorization scopes, policies and permissions to define and apply access control to resources.\n+\n+Resources define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of authorization scopes - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+Policies define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, permissions tie together the resources, authorization scopes and policies that specify _users U can perform actions A on resource R_.\n+\n+For more information about Keycloak Authorization Services, see {keycloak-authorization-services}, but note that the Authorization Services documentation is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources rather than access to Kafka.\n+\n+When viewing resources from the Keycloak user interface you will see a list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers, patterns in a specific format that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+For example, this pattern targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_':\n+\n+----\n+kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*  \n+---- \n+\n+If a cluster is not specified by name ( `kafka-cluster:cluster-1`), the specifier targets any cluster. For example, this pattern targets any cluster with a name starting  'x_':\n+----\n+Group:x_* \n+----\n+\n+\n+The possible resource types, such as `Topic`, `Group` and `Cluster`, mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model].\n+\n+*Authorization Scopes* lists of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on specific resources.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+The list of actions mirrors Kafka permissions and is the same for any deployment.\n+\n+Rather than importing authorization scopes manually into every new client, you can use a link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file.\n+\n+You must make sure that the client is enabled in Keycloak for Authorization Services. After which, you can import a JSON file from the *Authorization* tab. You can see the loaded scopes from the *Authorization Scopes* page.\n+\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+The *Policies* tab has filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the roles, or groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be defined programmatically using JavaScript so the logic considers the context of the client session, such as the IP of a Kafka client.\n+\n+The *Permissions* tab defines role bindings that associate resources, authorization scopes and policies for applying a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Use a clear, descriptive name for each permission definition so that it is obvious what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+----\n+Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+----\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+== Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties << EOF\n+security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT\n+sasl.mechanism=OAUTHBEARER\n+sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required \\\n+  oauth.client.id=\"team-a-client\" \\\n+  oauth.client.secret=\"team-a-client-secret\" \\\n+  oauth.token.endpoint.uri=\"http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/kafka-authz/protocol/openid-connect/token\" ;\n+sasl.login.callback.handler.class=io.strimzi.kafka.oauth.client.JaasClientOauthLoginCallbackHandler\n+EOF\n+```\n+\n+In the Keycloak Console you can find which roles are assigned to the `team-a-client` service account, by selecting `team-a-client` in the `Clients` section.\n+and then opening the `Service Account Roles` tab for the client.\n+You should see the `Dev Team A` realm role assigned.\n+\n+We can now use this configuration with Kafka's CLI tools.\n+\n+\n+### Producing the Messages\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages to topic 'my-topic':\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic my-topic \\\n+  --producer.config=/tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+```\n+\n+When we press `Enter` to push the first message we receive `Not authorized to access topics: [my-topic]` error.\n+\n+`team-a-client` has a `Dev Team A` role which gives it permissions to do anything on topics that start with 'a_', and only write to topics that start with 'x_'.\n+The topic named `my-topic` matches neither of those.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application, and let's try to write to topic `a_messages`.\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+  --producer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+Second message\n+```\n+\n+Although we can see some unrelated warnings, looking at the Kafka container log there is DEBUG level output saying 'Authorization GRANTED'.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application.\n+\n+You can see the Kafka container log by running:\n+\n+    kubectl logs my-cluster-kafka-0 -f\n+\n+### Consuming the Messages\n+\n+Let's now try to consume the messages we have produced.\n+\n+    bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+      --from-beginning --consumer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+\n+This gives us an error like: `Not authorized to access group: console-consumer-55841`.\n+\n+The reason is that we have to override the default consumer group name -

Because they are refreshed, any changes to the grants on the Keycloak server are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+== Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/examples/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/examples\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for Keycloak\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` (for example, `default`), use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+----\n+\n+\n+== Using the Keycloak Admin Console to configure authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+----\n+\n+Use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as username and password.\n+\n+In the upper left corner under the Keycloak icon you should see `Master` selected as the current realm.\n+Moving the mouse pointer over it should reveal two additional realms - `Demo` and `Kafka-authz`.\n+\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Selecting it will open the `Realm Settings` for the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+From the *Realm Settings* you can navigate to  *Groups*, *Roles*, *Clients* and *Users*.\n+\n+Under *Groups*, you can view groups to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with a name assigned. Typically, they are used to compartmentalize users into geographical, organizational or departmental units, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make a user a member of a group through a custom LDAP server admin user interface, for example, to grant them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under *Users*, when viewing all users you will see two users defined: `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under *Roles*, you can view the realm roles to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to _tag_ users with organizational roles and have the requisite permissions.\n+Roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider. If LDAP is a requirement, you could use groups instead.\n+\n+Under *Clients*, you can view the additional client configurations: `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth 2.0 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth 2.0 client authentication.\n+This client also contains the Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client from the *Authorization* tab, which becomes visible when *Authorization Enabled* is switched on from the *Settings* tab.\n+\n+\n+== Defining Authorization Services for access control\n+\n+Keycloak Authorization Services use authorization scopes, policies and permissions to define and apply access control to resources.\n+\n+Resources define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of authorization scopes - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+Policies define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, permissions tie together the resources, authorization scopes and policies that specify _users U can perform actions A on resource R_.\n+\n+For more information about Keycloak Authorization Services, see {keycloak-authorization-services}, but note that the Authorization Services documentation is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources rather than access to Kafka.\n+\n+When viewing resources from the Keycloak user interface you will see a list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers, patterns in a specific format that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+For example, this pattern targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_':\n+\n+----\n+kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*  \n+---- \n+\n+If a cluster is not specified by name ( `kafka-cluster:cluster-1`), the specifier targets any cluster. For example, this pattern targets any cluster with a name starting  'x_':\n+----\n+Group:x_* \n+----\n+\n+\n+The possible resource types, such as `Topic`, `Group` and `Cluster`, mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model].\n+\n+*Authorization Scopes* lists of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on specific resources.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+The list of actions mirrors Kafka permissions and is the same for any deployment.\n+\n+Rather than importing authorization scopes manually into every new client, you can use a link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file.\n+\n+You must make sure that the client is enabled in Keycloak for Authorization Services. After which, you can import a JSON file from the *Authorization* tab. You can see the loaded scopes from the *Authorization Scopes* page.\n+\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+The *Policies* tab has filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the roles, or groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be defined programmatically using JavaScript so the logic considers the context of the client session, such as the IP of a Kafka client.\n+\n+The *Permissions* tab defines role bindings that associate resources, authorization scopes and policies for applying a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Use a clear, descriptive name for each permission definition so that it is obvious what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+----\n+Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+----\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+== Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties << EOF\n+security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT\n+sasl.mechanism=OAUTHBEARER\n+sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required \\\n+  oauth.client.id=\"team-a-client\" \\\n+  oauth.client.secret=\"team-a-client-secret\" \\\n+  oauth.token.endpoint.uri=\"http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/kafka-authz/protocol/openid-connect/token\" ;\n+sasl.login.callback.handler.class=io.strimzi.kafka.oauth.client.JaasClientOauthLoginCallbackHandler\n+EOF\n+```\n+\n+In the Keycloak Console you can find which roles are assigned to the `team-a-client` service account, by selecting `team-a-client` in the `Clients` section.\n+and then opening the `Service Account Roles` tab for the client.\n+You should see the `Dev Team A` realm role assigned.\n+\n+We can now use this configuration with Kafka's CLI tools.\n+\n+\n+### Producing the Messages\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages to topic 'my-topic':\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic my-topic \\\n+  --producer.config=/tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+```\n+\n+When we press `Enter` to push the first message we receive `Not authorized to access topics: [my-topic]` error.\n+\n+`team-a-client` has a `Dev Team A` role which gives it permissions to do anything on topics that start with 'a_', and only write to topics that start with 'x_'.\n+The topic named `my-topic` matches neither of those.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application, and let's try to write to topic `a_messages`.\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+  --producer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+Second message\n+```\n+\n+Although we can see some unrelated warnings, looking at the Kafka container log there is DEBUG level output saying 'Authorization GRANTED'.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application.\n+\n+You can see the Kafka container log by running:\n+\n+    kubectl logs my-cluster-kafka-0 -f\n+\n+### Consuming the Messages\n+\n+Let's now try to consume the messages we have produced.\n+\n+    bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+      --from-beginning --consumer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+\n+This gives us an error like: `Not authorized to access group: console-consumer-55841`.\n+\n+The reason is that we have to override the default consumer group name -

Because they are refreshed, any changes to the grants on the Keycloak server are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+== Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/examples/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/examples\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for Keycloak\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` (for example, `default`), use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+----\n+\n+\n+== Using the Keycloak Admin Console to configure authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+----\n+\n+Use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as username and password.\n+\n+In the upper left corner under the Keycloak icon you should see `Master` selected as the current realm.\n+Moving the mouse pointer over it should reveal two additional realms - `Demo` and `Kafka-authz`.\n+\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Selecting it will open the `Realm Settings` for the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+From the *Realm Settings* you can navigate to  *Groups*, *Roles*, *Clients* and *Users*.\n+\n+Under *Groups*, you can view groups to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with a name assigned. Typically, they are used to compartmentalize users into geographical, organizational or departmental units, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make a user a member of a group through a custom LDAP server admin user interface, for example, to grant them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under *Users*, when viewing all users you will see two users defined: `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under *Roles*, you can view the realm roles to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to _tag_ users with organizational roles and have the requisite permissions.\n+Roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider. If LDAP is a requirement, you could use groups instead.\n+\n+Under *Clients*, you can view the additional client configurations: `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth 2.0 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth 2.0 client authentication.\n+This client also contains the Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client from the *Authorization* tab, which becomes visible when *Authorization Enabled* is switched on from the *Settings* tab.\n+\n+\n+== Defining Authorization Services for access control\n+\n+Keycloak Authorization Services use authorization scopes, policies and permissions to define and apply access control to resources.\n+\n+Resources define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of authorization scopes - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+Policies define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, permissions tie together the resources, authorization scopes and policies that specify _users U can perform actions A on resource R_.\n+\n+For more information about Keycloak Authorization Services, see {keycloak-authorization-services}, but note that the Authorization Services documentation is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources rather than access to Kafka.\n+\n+When viewing resources from the Keycloak user interface you will see a list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers, patterns in a specific format that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+For example, this pattern targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_':\n+\n+----\n+kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*  \n+---- \n+\n+If a cluster is not specified by name ( `kafka-cluster:cluster-1`), the specifier targets any cluster. For example, this pattern targets any cluster with a name starting  'x_':\n+----\n+Group:x_* \n+----\n+\n+\n+The possible resource types, such as `Topic`, `Group` and `Cluster`, mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model].\n+\n+*Authorization Scopes* lists of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on specific resources.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+The list of actions mirrors Kafka permissions and is the same for any deployment.\n+\n+Rather than importing authorization scopes manually into every new client, you can use a link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file.\n+\n+You must make sure that the client is enabled in Keycloak for Authorization Services. After which, you can import a JSON file from the *Authorization* tab. You can see the loaded scopes from the *Authorization Scopes* page.\n+\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+The *Policies* tab has filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the roles, or groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be defined programmatically using JavaScript so the logic considers the context of the client session, such as the IP of a Kafka client.\n+\n+The *Permissions* tab defines role bindings that associate resources, authorization scopes and policies for applying a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Use a clear, descriptive name for each permission definition so that it is obvious what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+----\n+Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+----\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+== Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties << EOF\n+security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT\n+sasl.mechanism=OAUTHBEARER\n+sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required \\\n+  oauth.client.id=\"team-a-client\" \\\n+  oauth.client.secret=\"team-a-client-secret\" \\\n+  oauth.token.endpoint.uri=\"http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/kafka-authz/protocol/openid-connect/token\" ;\n+sasl.login.callback.handler.class=io.strimzi.kafka.oauth.client.JaasClientOauthLoginCallbackHandler\n+EOF\n+```\n+\n+In the Keycloak Console you can find which roles are assigned to the `team-a-client` service account, by selecting `team-a-client` in the `Clients` section.\n+and then opening the `Service Account Roles` tab for the client.\n+You should see the `Dev Team A` realm role assigned.\n+\n+We can now use this configuration with Kafka's CLI tools.\n+\n+\n+### Producing the Messages\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages to topic 'my-topic':\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic my-topic \\\n+  --producer.config=/tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+```\n+\n+When we press `Enter` to push the first message we receive `Not authorized to access topics: [my-topic]` error.\n+\n+`team-a-client` has a `Dev Team A` role which gives it permissions to do anything on topics that start with 'a_', and only write to topics that start with 'x_'.\n+The topic named `my-topic` matches neither of those.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application, and let's try to write to topic `a_messages`.\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+  --producer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+Second message\n+```\n+\n+Although we can see some unrelated warnings, looking at the Kafka container log there is DEBUG level output saying 'Authorization GRANTED'.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application.\n+\n+You can see the Kafka container log by running:\n+\n+    kubectl logs my-cluster-kafka-0 -f\n+\n+### Consuming the Messages\n+\n+Let's now try to consume the messages we have produced.\n+\n+    bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+      --from-beginning --consumer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+\n+This gives us an error like: `Not authorized to access group: console-consumer-55841`.\n+\n+The reason is that we have to override the default consumer group name -

Because they are refreshed, any changes to the grants on the Keycloak server are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+== Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/examples/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/examples\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for Keycloak\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` (for example, `default`), use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+----\n+\n+\n+== Using the Keycloak Admin Console to configure authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+----\n+\n+Use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as username and password.\n+\n+In the upper left corner under the Keycloak icon you should see `Master` selected as the current realm.\n+Moving the mouse pointer over it should reveal two additional realms - `Demo` and `Kafka-authz`.\n+\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Selecting it will open the `Realm Settings` for the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+From the *Realm Settings* you can navigate to  *Groups*, *Roles*, *Clients* and *Users*.\n+\n+Under *Groups*, you can view groups to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with a name assigned. Typically, they are used to compartmentalize users into geographical, organizational or departmental units, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make a user a member of a group through a custom LDAP server admin user interface, for example, to grant them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under *Users*, when viewing all users you will see two users defined: `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under *Roles*, you can view the realm roles to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to _tag_ users with organizational roles and have the requisite permissions.\n+Roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider. If LDAP is a requirement, you could use groups instead.\n+\n+Under *Clients*, you can view the additional client configurations: `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth 2.0 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth 2.0 client authentication.\n+This client also contains the Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client from the *Authorization* tab, which becomes visible when *Authorization Enabled* is switched on from the *Settings* tab.\n+\n+\n+== Defining Authorization Services for access control\n+\n+Keycloak Authorization Services use authorization scopes, policies and permissions to define and apply access control to resources.\n+\n+Resources define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of authorization scopes - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+Policies define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, permissions tie together the resources, authorization scopes and policies that specify _users U can perform actions A on resource R_.\n+\n+For more information about Keycloak Authorization Services, see {keycloak-authorization-services}, but note that the Authorization Services documentation is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources rather than access to Kafka.\n+\n+When viewing resources from the Keycloak user interface you will see a list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers, patterns in a specific format that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+For example, this pattern targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_':\n+\n+----\n+kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*  \n+---- \n+\n+If a cluster is not specified by name ( `kafka-cluster:cluster-1`), the specifier targets any cluster. For example, this pattern targets any cluster with a name starting  'x_':\n+----\n+Group:x_* \n+----\n+\n+\n+The possible resource types, such as `Topic`, `Group` and `Cluster`, mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model].\n+\n+*Authorization Scopes* lists of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on specific resources.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+The list of actions mirrors Kafka permissions and is the same for any deployment.\n+\n+Rather than importing authorization scopes manually into every new client, you can use a link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file.\n+\n+You must make sure that the client is enabled in Keycloak for Authorization Services. After which, you can import a JSON file from the *Authorization* tab. You can see the loaded scopes from the *Authorization Scopes* page.\n+\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+The *Policies* tab has filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the roles, or groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be defined programmatically using JavaScript so the logic considers the context of the client session, such as the IP of a Kafka client.\n+\n+The *Permissions* tab defines role bindings that associate resources, authorization scopes and policies for applying a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Use a clear, descriptive name for each permission definition so that it is obvious what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+----\n+Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+----\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+== Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties << EOF\n+security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT\n+sasl.mechanism=OAUTHBEARER\n+sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required \\\n+  oauth.client.id=\"team-a-client\" \\\n+  oauth.client.secret=\"team-a-client-secret\" \\\n+  oauth.token.endpoint.uri=\"http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/kafka-authz/protocol/openid-connect/token\" ;\n+sasl.login.callback.handler.class=io.strimzi.kafka.oauth.client.JaasClientOauthLoginCallbackHandler\n+EOF\n+```\n+\n+In the Keycloak Console you can find which roles are assigned to the `team-a-client` service account, by selecting `team-a-client` in the `Clients` section.\n+and then opening the `Service Account Roles` tab for the client.\n+You should see the `Dev Team A` realm role assigned.\n+\n+We can now use this configuration with Kafka's CLI tools.\n+\n+\n+### Producing the Messages\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages to topic 'my-topic':\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic my-topic \\\n+  --producer.config=/tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+```\n+\n+When we press `Enter` to push the first message we receive `Not authorized to access topics: [my-topic]` error.\n+\n+`team-a-client` has a `Dev Team A` role which gives it permissions to do anything on topics that start with 'a_', and only write to topics that start with 'x_'.\n+The topic named `my-topic` matches neither of those.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application, and let's try to write to topic `a_messages`.\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+  --producer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+Second message\n+```\n+\n+Although we can see some unrelated warnings, looking at the Kafka container log there is DEBUG level output saying 'Authorization GRANTED'.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application.\n+\n+You can see the Kafka container log by running:\n+\n+    kubectl logs my-cluster-kafka-0 -f\n+\n+### Consuming the Messages\n+\n+Let's now try to consume the messages we have produced.\n+\n+    bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+      --from-beginning --consumer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+\n+This gives us an error like: `Not authorized to access group: console-consumer-55841`.\n+\n+The reason is that we have to override the default consumer group name -

Because they are refreshed, any changes to the grants on the Keycloak server are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+== Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/examples/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/examples\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for Keycloak\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` (for example, `default`), use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+----\n+\n+\n+== Using the Keycloak Admin Console to configure authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+----\n+\n+Use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as username and password.\n+\n+In the upper left corner under the Keycloak icon you should see `Master` selected as the current realm.\n+Moving the mouse pointer over it should reveal two additional realms - `Demo` and `Kafka-authz`.\n+\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Selecting it will open the `Realm Settings` for the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+From the *Realm Settings* you can navigate to  *Groups*, *Roles*, *Clients* and *Users*.\n+\n+Under *Groups*, you can view groups to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with a name assigned. Typically, they are used to compartmentalize users into geographical, organizational or departmental units, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make a user a member of a group through a custom LDAP server admin user interface, for example, to grant them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under *Users*, when viewing all users you will see two users defined: `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under *Roles*, you can view the realm roles to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to _tag_ users with organizational roles and have the requisite permissions.\n+Roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider. If LDAP is a requirement, you could use groups instead.\n+\n+Under *Clients*, you can view the additional client configurations: `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth 2.0 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth 2.0 client authentication.\n+This client also contains the Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client from the *Authorization* tab, which becomes visible when *Authorization Enabled* is switched on from the *Settings* tab.\n+\n+\n+== Defining Authorization Services for access control\n+\n+Keycloak Authorization Services use authorization scopes, policies and permissions to define and apply access control to resources.\n+\n+Resources define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of authorization scopes - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+Policies define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, permissions tie together the resources, authorization scopes and policies that specify _users U can perform actions A on resource R_.\n+\n+For more information about Keycloak Authorization Services, see {keycloak-authorization-services}, but note that the Authorization Services documentation is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources rather than access to Kafka.\n+\n+When viewing resources from the Keycloak user interface you will see a list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers, patterns in a specific format that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+For example, this pattern targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_':\n+\n+----\n+kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*  \n+---- \n+\n+If a cluster is not specified by name ( `kafka-cluster:cluster-1`), the specifier targets any cluster. For example, this pattern targets any cluster with a name starting  'x_':\n+----\n+Group:x_* \n+----\n+\n+\n+The possible resource types, such as `Topic`, `Group` and `Cluster`, mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model].\n+\n+*Authorization Scopes* lists of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on specific resources.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+The list of actions mirrors Kafka permissions and is the same for any deployment.\n+\n+Rather than importing authorization scopes manually into every new client, you can use a link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file.\n+\n+You must make sure that the client is enabled in Keycloak for Authorization Services. After which, you can import a JSON file from the *Authorization* tab. You can see the loaded scopes from the *Authorization Scopes* page.\n+\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+The *Policies* tab has filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the roles, or groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be defined programmatically using JavaScript so the logic considers the context of the client session, such as the IP of a Kafka client.\n+\n+The *Permissions* tab defines role bindings that associate resources, authorization scopes and policies for applying a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Use a clear, descriptive name for each permission definition so that it is obvious what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+----\n+Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+----\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+== Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties << EOF\n+security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT\n+sasl.mechanism=OAUTHBEARER\n+sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required \\\n+  oauth.client.id=\"team-a-client\" \\\n+  oauth.client.secret=\"team-a-client-secret\" \\\n+  oauth.token.endpoint.uri=\"http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/kafka-authz/protocol/openid-connect/token\" ;\n+sasl.login.callback.handler.class=io.strimzi.kafka.oauth.client.JaasClientOauthLoginCallbackHandler\n+EOF\n+```\n+\n+In the Keycloak Console you can find which roles are assigned to the `team-a-client` service account, by selecting `team-a-client` in the `Clients` section.\n+and then opening the `Service Account Roles` tab for the client.\n+You should see the `Dev Team A` realm role assigned.\n+\n+We can now use this configuration with Kafka's CLI tools.\n+\n+\n+### Producing the Messages\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages to topic 'my-topic':\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic my-topic \\\n+  --producer.config=/tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+```\n+\n+When we press `Enter` to push the first message we receive `Not authorized to access topics: [my-topic]` error.\n+\n+`team-a-client` has a `Dev Team A` role which gives it permissions to do anything on topics that start with 'a_', and only write to topics that start with 'x_'.\n+The topic named `my-topic` matches neither of those.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application, and let's try to write to topic `a_messages`.\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+  --producer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+Second message\n+```\n+\n+Although we can see some unrelated warnings, looking at the Kafka container log there is DEBUG level output saying 'Authorization GRANTED'.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application.\n+\n+You can see the Kafka container log by running:\n+\n+    kubectl logs my-cluster-kafka-0 -f\n+\n+### Consuming the Messages\n+\n+Let's now try to consume the messages we have produced.\n+\n+    bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+      --from-beginning --consumer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+\n+This gives us an error like: `Not authorized to access group: console-consumer-55841`.\n+\n+The reason is that we have to override the default consumer group name -

Because they are refreshed, any changes to the grants on the Keycloak server are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+== Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/examples/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/examples\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for Keycloak\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` (for example, `default`), use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+----\n+\n+\n+== Using the Keycloak Admin Console to configure authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+----\n+\n+Use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as username and password.\n+\n+In the upper left corner under the Keycloak icon you should see `Master` selected as the current realm.\n+Moving the mouse pointer over it should reveal two additional realms - `Demo` and `Kafka-authz`.\n+\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Selecting it will open the `Realm Settings` for the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+From the *Realm Settings* you can navigate to  *Groups*, *Roles*, *Clients* and *Users*.\n+\n+Under *Groups*, you can view groups to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with a name assigned. Typically, they are used to compartmentalize users into geographical, organizational or departmental units, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make a user a member of a group through a custom LDAP server admin user interface, for example, to grant them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under *Users*, when viewing all users you will see two users defined: `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under *Roles*, you can view the realm roles to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to _tag_ users with organizational roles and have the requisite permissions.\n+Roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider. If LDAP is a requirement, you could use groups instead.\n+\n+Under *Clients*, you can view the additional client configurations: `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth 2.0 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth 2.0 client authentication.\n+This client also contains the Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client from the *Authorization* tab, which becomes visible when *Authorization Enabled* is switched on from the *Settings* tab.\n+\n+\n+== Defining Authorization Services for access control\n+\n+Keycloak Authorization Services use authorization scopes, policies and permissions to define and apply access control to resources.\n+\n+Resources define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of authorization scopes - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+Policies define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, permissions tie together the resources, authorization scopes and policies that specify _users U can perform actions A on resource R_.\n+\n+For more information about Keycloak Authorization Services, see {keycloak-authorization-services}, but note that the Authorization Services documentation is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources rather than access to Kafka.\n+\n+When viewing resources from the Keycloak user interface you will see a list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers, patterns in a specific format that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+For example, this pattern targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_':\n+\n+----\n+kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*  \n+---- \n+\n+If a cluster is not specified by name ( `kafka-cluster:cluster-1`), the specifier targets any cluster. For example, this pattern targets any cluster with a name starting  'x_':\n+----\n+Group:x_* \n+----\n+\n+\n+The possible resource types, such as `Topic`, `Group` and `Cluster`, mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model].\n+\n+*Authorization Scopes* lists of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on specific resources.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+The list of actions mirrors Kafka permissions and is the same for any deployment.\n+\n+Rather than importing authorization scopes manually into every new client, you can use a link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file.\n+\n+You must make sure that the client is enabled in Keycloak for Authorization Services. After which, you can import a JSON file from the *Authorization* tab. You can see the loaded scopes from the *Authorization Scopes* page.\n+\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+The *Policies* tab has filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the roles, or groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be defined programmatically using JavaScript so the logic considers the context of the client session, such as the IP of a Kafka client.\n+\n+The *Permissions* tab defines role bindings that associate resources, authorization scopes and policies for applying a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Use a clear, descriptive name for each permission definition so that it is obvious what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+----\n+Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+----\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+== Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties << EOF\n+security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT\n+sasl.mechanism=OAUTHBEARER\n+sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required \\\n+  oauth.client.id=\"team-a-client\" \\\n+  oauth.client.secret=\"team-a-client-secret\" \\\n+  oauth.token.endpoint.uri=\"http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/kafka-authz/protocol/openid-connect/token\" ;\n+sasl.login.callback.handler.class=io.strimzi.kafka.oauth.client.JaasClientOauthLoginCallbackHandler\n+EOF\n+```\n+\n+In the Keycloak Console you can find which roles are assigned to the `team-a-client` service account, by selecting `team-a-client` in the `Clients` section.\n+and then opening the `Service Account Roles` tab for the client.\n+You should see the `Dev Team A` realm role assigned.\n+\n+We can now use this configuration with Kafka's CLI tools.\n+\n+\n+### Producing the Messages\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages to topic 'my-topic':\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic my-topic \\\n+  --producer.config=/tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+```\n+\n+When we press `Enter` to push the first message we receive `Not authorized to access topics: [my-topic]` error.\n+\n+`team-a-client` has a `Dev Team A` role which gives it permissions to do anything on topics that start with 'a_', and only write to topics that start with 'x_'.\n+The topic named `my-topic` matches neither of those.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application, and let's try to write to topic `a_messages`.\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+  --producer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+Second message\n+```\n+\n+Although we can see some unrelated warnings, looking at the Kafka container log there is DEBUG level output saying 'Authorization GRANTED'.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application.\n+\n+You can see the Kafka container log by running:\n+\n+    kubectl logs my-cluster-kafka-0 -f\n+\n+### Consuming the Messages\n+\n+Let's now try to consume the messages we have produced.\n+\n+    bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+      --from-beginning --consumer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+\n+This gives us an error like: `Not authorized to access group: console-consumer-55841`.\n+\n+The reason is that we have to override the default consumer group name -

module:\n+//\n+// con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-authorization-services.adoc\n+\n+[id='con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-example_{context}']\n+= Example authorization rules configuration using Authorization Services\n+\n+This is an end-to-end example of using Keycloak Authorization Services to configure authorization rules for use with `keycloak` authorization in Strimzi.\n+The example starts by deploying the Keycloak server with pre-configured realms, requiring no additional configuration.\n+We deploy the Kafka cluster configured to use one of the pre-configured realms.\n+We connect to the Keycloak Admin Console and demonstrate the sections of the user interface where authorizations rules are configured.\n+We use Kafka CLI client tools with different personal and service accounts to demonstrate limited access based on the permissions granted to different accounts.\n+\n+\n+== Token Based Authorization with Keycloak Authorization Services\n+\n+Once the Kafka Broker has obtained an access token by using `oauth` authentication, it is possible to use centrally managed authorization rules to enforce access restrictions onto Kafka Clients.\n+For this, Strimzi Kafka Operator comes with `keycloak` authorization which uses Keycloak Authorization Services to centrally manage permissions.\n+\n+When using `keycloak` authorization a custom authorizer is configured on the Kafka Broker that uses Authorization Services REST endpoints available on Keycloak, which provide a list of granted permissions on resources for authenticated users.\n+The list of grants (permissions) is fetched as the first action after an authenticated session is established by the Kafka client, and then regularly refreshed in the background.\n+Grants are cached and enforced locally on the Kafka Broker for each user session to provide fast authorization decisions. Because they are refreshed, any changes to the grants on the Keycloak server are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+== Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/examples/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/examples\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for Keycloak\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` (for example, `default`), use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+----\n+\n+\n+== Using the Keycloak Admin Console to configure authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+----\n+\n+Use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as username and password.\n+\n+In the upper left corner under the Keycloak icon you should see `Master` selected as the current realm.\n+Moving the mouse pointer over it should reveal two additional realms - `Demo` and `Kafka-authz`.\n+\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Selecting it will open the `Realm Settings` for the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+From the *Realm Settings* you can navigate to  *Groups*, *Roles*, *Clients* and *Users*.\n+\n+Under *Groups*, you can view groups to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with a name assigned. Typically, they are used to compartmentalize users into geographical, organizational or departmental units, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make a user a member of a group through a custom LDAP server admin user interface, for example, to grant them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under *Users*, when viewing all users you will see two users defined: `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under *Roles*, you can view the realm roles to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to _tag_ users with organizational roles and have the requisite permissions.\n+Roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider. If LDAP is a requirement, you could use groups instead.\n+\n+Under *Clients*, you can view the additional client configurations: `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth 2.0 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth 2.0 client authentication.\n+This client also contains the Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client from the *Authorization* tab, which becomes visible when *Authorization Enabled* is switched on from the *Settings* tab.\n+\n+\n+== Defining Authorization Services for access control\n+\n+Keycloak Authorization Services use authorization scopes, policies and permissions to define and apply access control to resources.\n+\n+Resources define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of authorization scopes - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+Policies define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, permissions tie together the resources, authorization scopes and policies that specify _users U can perform actions A on resource R_.\n+\n+For more information about Keycloak Authorization Services, see {keycloak-authorization-services}, but note that the Authorization Services documentation is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources rather than access to Kafka.\n+\n+When viewing resources from the Keycloak user interface you will see a list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers, patterns in a specific format that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+For example, this pattern targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_':\n+\n+----\n+kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*  \n+---- \n+\n+If a cluster is not specified by name ( `kafka-cluster:cluster-1`), the specifier targets any cluster. For example, this pattern targets any cluster with a name starting  'x_':\n+----\n+Group:x_* \n+----\n+\n+\n+The possible resource types, such as `Topic`, `Group` and `Cluster`, mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model].\n+\n+*Authorization Scopes* lists of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on specific resources.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+The list of actions mirrors Kafka permissions and is the same for any deployment.\n+\n+Rather than importing authorization scopes manually into every new client, you can use a link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file.\n+\n+You must make sure that the client is enabled in Keycloak for Authorization Services. After which, you can import a JSON file from the *Authorization* tab. You can see the loaded scopes from the *Authorization Scopes* page.\n+\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+The *Policies* tab has filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the roles, or groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be defined programmatically using JavaScript so the logic considers the context of the client session, such as the IP of a Kafka client.\n+\n+The *Permissions* tab defines role bindings that associate resources, authorization scopes and policies for applying a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Use a clear, descriptive name for each permission definition so that it is obvious what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+----\n+Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+----\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+== Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties << EOF\n+security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT\n+sasl.mechanism=OAUTHBEARER\n+sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required \\\n+  oauth.client.id=\"team-a-client\" \\\n+  oauth.client.secret=\"team-a-client-secret\" \\\n+  oauth.token.endpoint.uri=\"http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/kafka-authz/protocol/openid-connect/token\" ;\n+sasl.login.callback.handler.class=io.strimzi.kafka.oauth.client.JaasClientOauthLoginCallbackHandler\n+EOF\n+```\n+\n+In the Keycloak Console you can find which roles are assigned to the `team-a-client` service account, by selecting `team-a-client` in the `Clients` section.\n+and then opening the `Service Account Roles` tab for the client.\n+You should see the `Dev Team A` realm role assigned.\n+\n+We can now use this configuration with Kafka's CLI tools.\n+\n+\n+### Producing the Messages\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages to topic 'my-topic':\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic my-topic \\\n+  --producer.config=/tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+```\n+\n+When we press `Enter` to push the first message we receive `Not authorized to access topics: [my-topic]` error.\n+\n+`team-a-client` has a `Dev Team A` role which gives it permissions to do anything on topics that start with 'a_', and only write to topics that start with 'x_'.\n+The topic named `my-topic` matches neither of those.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application, and let's try to write to topic `a_messages`.\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+  --producer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+Second message\n+```\n+\n+Although we can see some unrelated warnings, looking at the Kafka container log there is DEBUG level output saying 'Authorization GRANTED'.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application.\n+\n+You can see the Kafka container log by running:\n+\n+    kubectl logs my-cluster-kafka-0 -f\n+\n+### Consuming the Messages\n+\n+Let's now try to consume the messages we have produced.\n+\n+    bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+      --from-beginning --consumer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+\n+This gives us an error like: `Not authorized to access group: console-consumer-55841`.\n+\n+The reason is that we have to override the default consumer group name -

Because they are refreshed, any changes to the grants on the Keycloak server are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+== Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/examples/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/examples\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for Keycloak\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` (for example, `default`), use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+----\n+\n+\n+== Using the Keycloak Admin Console to configure authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+----\n+\n+Use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as username and password.\n+\n+In the upper left corner under the Keycloak icon you should see `Master` selected as the current realm.\n+Moving the mouse pointer over it should reveal two additional realms - `Demo` and `Kafka-authz`.\n+\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Selecting it will open the `Realm Settings` for the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+From the *Realm Settings* you can navigate to  *Groups*, *Roles*, *Clients* and *Users*.\n+\n+Under *Groups*, you can view groups to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with a name assigned. Typically, they are used to compartmentalize users into geographical, organizational or departmental units, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make a user a member of a group through a custom LDAP server admin user interface, for example, to grant them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under *Users*, when viewing all users you will see two users defined: `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under *Roles*, you can view the realm roles to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to _tag_ users with organizational roles and have the requisite permissions.\n+Roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider. If LDAP is a requirement, you could use groups instead.\n+\n+Under *Clients*, you can view the additional client configurations: `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth 2.0 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth 2.0 client authentication.\n+This client also contains the Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client from the *Authorization* tab, which becomes visible when *Authorization Enabled* is switched on from the *Settings* tab.\n+\n+\n+== Defining Authorization Services for access control\n+\n+Keycloak Authorization Services use authorization scopes, policies and permissions to define and apply access control to resources.\n+\n+Resources define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of authorization scopes - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+Policies define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, permissions tie together the resources, authorization scopes and policies that specify _users U can perform actions A on resource R_.\n+\n+For more information about Keycloak Authorization Services, see {keycloak-authorization-services}, but note that the Authorization Services documentation is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources rather than access to Kafka.\n+\n+When viewing resources from the Keycloak user interface you will see a list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers, patterns in a specific format that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+For example, this pattern targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_':\n+\n+----\n+kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*  \n+---- \n+\n+If a cluster is not specified by name ( `kafka-cluster:cluster-1`), the specifier targets any cluster. For example, this pattern targets any cluster with a name starting  'x_':\n+----\n+Group:x_* \n+----\n+\n+\n+The possible resource types, such as `Topic`, `Group` and `Cluster`, mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model].\n+\n+*Authorization Scopes* lists of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on specific resources.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+The list of actions mirrors Kafka permissions and is the same for any deployment.\n+\n+Rather than importing authorization scopes manually into every new client, you can use a link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file.\n+\n+You must make sure that the client is enabled in Keycloak for Authorization Services. After which, you can import a JSON file from the *Authorization* tab. You can see the loaded scopes from the *Authorization Scopes* page.\n+\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+The *Policies* tab has filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the roles, or groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be defined programmatically using JavaScript so the logic considers the context of the client session, such as the IP of a Kafka client.\n+\n+The *Permissions* tab defines role bindings that associate resources, authorization scopes and policies for applying a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Use a clear, descriptive name for each permission definition so that it is obvious what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+----\n+Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+----\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+== Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties << EOF\n+security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT\n+sasl.mechanism=OAUTHBEARER\n+sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required \\\n+  oauth.client.id=\"team-a-client\" \\\n+  oauth.client.secret=\"team-a-client-secret\" \\\n+  oauth.token.endpoint.uri=\"http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/kafka-authz/protocol/openid-connect/token\" ;\n+sasl.login.callback.handler.class=io.strimzi.kafka.oauth.client.JaasClientOauthLoginCallbackHandler\n+EOF\n+```\n+\n+In the Keycloak Console you can find which roles are assigned to the `team-a-client` service account, by selecting `team-a-client` in the `Clients` section.\n+and then opening the `Service Account Roles` tab for the client.\n+You should see the `Dev Team A` realm role assigned.\n+\n+We can now use this configuration with Kafka's CLI tools.\n+\n+\n+### Producing the Messages\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages to topic 'my-topic':\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic my-topic \\\n+  --producer.config=/tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+```\n+\n+When we press `Enter` to push the first message we receive `Not authorized to access topics: [my-topic]` error.\n+\n+`team-a-client` has a `Dev Team A` role which gives it permissions to do anything on topics that start with 'a_', and only write to topics that start with 'x_'.\n+The topic named `my-topic` matches neither of those.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application, and let's try to write to topic `a_messages`.\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+  --producer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+Second message\n+```\n+\n+Although we can see some unrelated warnings, looking at the Kafka container log there is DEBUG level output saying 'Authorization GRANTED'.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application.\n+\n+You can see the Kafka container log by running:\n+\n+    kubectl logs my-cluster-kafka-0 -f\n+\n+### Consuming the Messages\n+\n+Let's now try to consume the messages we have produced.\n+\n+    bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+      --from-beginning --consumer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+\n+This gives us an error like: `Not authorized to access group: console-consumer-55841`.\n+\n+The reason is that we have to override the default consumer group name -

Because they are refreshed, any changes to the grants on the Keycloak server are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+== Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/examples/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/examples\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for Keycloak\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` (for example, `default`), use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+----\n+\n+\n+== Using the Keycloak Admin Console to configure authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+----\n+\n+Use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as username and password.\n+\n+In the upper left corner under the Keycloak icon you should see `Master` selected as the current realm.\n+Moving the mouse pointer over it should reveal two additional realms - `Demo` and `Kafka-authz`.\n+\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Selecting it will open the `Realm Settings` for the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+From the *Realm Settings* you can navigate to  *Groups*, *Roles*, *Clients* and *Users*.\n+\n+Under *Groups*, you can view groups to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with a name assigned. Typically, they are used to compartmentalize users into geographical, organizational or departmental units, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make a user a member of a group through a custom LDAP server admin user interface, for example, to grant them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under *Users*, when viewing all users you will see two users defined: `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under *Roles*, you can view the realm roles to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to _tag_ users with organizational roles and have the requisite permissions.\n+Roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider. If LDAP is a requirement, you could use groups instead.\n+\n+Under *Clients*, you can view the additional client configurations: `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth 2.0 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth 2.0 client authentication.\n+This client also contains the Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client from the *Authorization* tab, which becomes visible when *Authorization Enabled* is switched on from the *Settings* tab.\n+\n+\n+== Defining Authorization Services for access control\n+\n+Keycloak Authorization Services use authorization scopes, policies and permissions to define and apply access control to resources.\n+\n+Resources define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of authorization scopes - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+Policies define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, permissions tie together the resources, authorization scopes and policies that specify _users U can perform actions A on resource R_.\n+\n+For more information about Keycloak Authorization Services, see {keycloak-authorization-services}, but note that the Authorization Services documentation is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources rather than access to Kafka.\n+\n+When viewing resources from the Keycloak user interface you will see a list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers, patterns in a specific format that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+For example, this pattern targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_':\n+\n+----\n+kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*  \n+---- \n+\n+If a cluster is not specified by name ( `kafka-cluster:cluster-1`), the specifier targets any cluster. For example, this pattern targets any cluster with a name starting  'x_':\n+----\n+Group:x_* \n+----\n+\n+\n+The possible resource types, such as `Topic`, `Group` and `Cluster`, mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model].\n+\n+*Authorization Scopes* lists of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on specific resources.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+The list of actions mirrors Kafka permissions and is the same for any deployment.\n+\n+Rather than importing authorization scopes manually into every new client, you can use a link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file.\n+\n+You must make sure that the client is enabled in Keycloak for Authorization Services. After which, you can import a JSON file from the *Authorization* tab. You can see the loaded scopes from the *Authorization Scopes* page.\n+\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+The *Policies* tab has filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the roles, or groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be defined programmatically using JavaScript so the logic considers the context of the client session, such as the IP of a Kafka client.\n+\n+The *Permissions* tab defines role bindings that associate resources, authorization scopes and policies for applying a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Use a clear, descriptive name for each permission definition so that it is obvious what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+----\n+Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+----\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+== Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties << EOF\n+security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT\n+sasl.mechanism=OAUTHBEARER\n+sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required \\\n+  oauth.client.id=\"team-a-client\" \\\n+  oauth.client.secret=\"team-a-client-secret\" \\\n+  oauth.token.endpoint.uri=\"http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/kafka-authz/protocol/openid-connect/token\" ;\n+sasl.login.callback.handler.class=io.strimzi.kafka.oauth.client.JaasClientOauthLoginCallbackHandler\n+EOF\n+```\n+\n+In the Keycloak Console you can find which roles are assigned to the `team-a-client` service account, by selecting `team-a-client` in the `Clients` section.\n+and then opening the `Service Account Roles` tab for the client.\n+You should see the `Dev Team A` realm role assigned.\n+\n+We can now use this configuration with Kafka's CLI tools.\n+\n+\n+### Producing the Messages\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages to topic 'my-topic':\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic my-topic \\\n+  --producer.config=/tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+```\n+\n+When we press `Enter` to push the first message we receive `Not authorized to access topics: [my-topic]` error.\n+\n+`team-a-client` has a `Dev Team A` role which gives it permissions to do anything on topics that start with 'a_', and only write to topics that start with 'x_'.\n+The topic named `my-topic` matches neither of those.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application, and let's try to write to topic `a_messages`.\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+  --producer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+Second message\n+```\n+\n+Although we can see some unrelated warnings, looking at the Kafka container log there is DEBUG level output saying 'Authorization GRANTED'.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application.\n+\n+You can see the Kafka container log by running:\n+\n+    kubectl logs my-cluster-kafka-0 -f\n+\n+### Consuming the Messages\n+\n+Let's now try to consume the messages we have produced.\n+\n+    bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+      --from-beginning --consumer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+\n+This gives us an error like: `Not authorized to access group: console-consumer-55841`.\n+\n+The reason is that we have to override the default consumer group name -

Because they are refreshed, any changes to the grants on the Keycloak server are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+== Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/examples/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/examples\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for Keycloak\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` (for example, `default`), use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+----\n+\n+\n+== Using the Keycloak Admin Console to configure authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+----\n+\n+Use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as username and password.\n+\n+In the upper left corner under the Keycloak icon you should see `Master` selected as the current realm.\n+Moving the mouse pointer over it should reveal two additional realms - `Demo` and `Kafka-authz`.\n+\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Selecting it will open the `Realm Settings` for the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+From the *Realm Settings* you can navigate to  *Groups*, *Roles*, *Clients* and *Users*.\n+\n+Under *Groups*, you can view groups to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with a name assigned. Typically, they are used to compartmentalize users into geographical, organizational or departmental units, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make a user a member of a group through a custom LDAP server admin user interface, for example, to grant them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under *Users*, when viewing all users you will see two users defined: `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under *Roles*, you can view the realm roles to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to _tag_ users with organizational roles and have the requisite permissions.\n+Roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider. If LDAP is a requirement, you could use groups instead.\n+\n+Under *Clients*, you can view the additional client configurations: `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth 2.0 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth 2.0 client authentication.\n+This client also contains the Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client from the *Authorization* tab, which becomes visible when *Authorization Enabled* is switched on from the *Settings* tab.\n+\n+\n+== Defining Authorization Services for access control\n+\n+Keycloak Authorization Services use authorization scopes, policies and permissions to define and apply access control to resources.\n+\n+Resources define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of authorization scopes - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+Policies define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, permissions tie together the resources, authorization scopes and policies that specify _users U can perform actions A on resource R_.\n+\n+For more information about Keycloak Authorization Services, see {keycloak-authorization-services}, but note that the Authorization Services documentation is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources rather than access to Kafka.\n+\n+When viewing resources from the Keycloak user interface you will see a list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers, patterns in a specific format that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+For example, this pattern targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_':\n+\n+----\n+kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*  \n+---- \n+\n+If a cluster is not specified by name ( `kafka-cluster:cluster-1`), the specifier targets any cluster. For example, this pattern targets any cluster with a name starting  'x_':\n+----\n+Group:x_* \n+----\n+\n+\n+The possible resource types, such as `Topic`, `Group` and `Cluster`, mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model].\n+\n+*Authorization Scopes* lists of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on specific resources.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+The list of actions mirrors Kafka permissions and is the same for any deployment.\n+\n+Rather than importing authorization scopes manually into every new client, you can use a link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file.\n+\n+You must make sure that the client is enabled in Keycloak for Authorization Services. After which, you can import a JSON file from the *Authorization* tab. You can see the loaded scopes from the *Authorization Scopes* page.\n+\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+The *Policies* tab has filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the roles, or groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be defined programmatically using JavaScript so the logic considers the context of the client session, such as the IP of a Kafka client.\n+\n+The *Permissions* tab defines role bindings that associate resources, authorization scopes and policies for applying a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Use a clear, descriptive name for each permission definition so that it is obvious what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+----\n+Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+----\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+== Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties << EOF\n+security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT\n+sasl.mechanism=OAUTHBEARER\n+sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required \\\n+  oauth.client.id=\"team-a-client\" \\\n+  oauth.client.secret=\"team-a-client-secret\" \\\n+  oauth.token.endpoint.uri=\"http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/kafka-authz/protocol/openid-connect/token\" ;\n+sasl.login.callback.handler.class=io.strimzi.kafka.oauth.client.JaasClientOauthLoginCallbackHandler\n+EOF\n+```\n+\n+In the Keycloak Console you can find which roles are assigned to the `team-a-client` service account, by selecting `team-a-client` in the `Clients` section.\n+and then opening the `Service Account Roles` tab for the client.\n+You should see the `Dev Team A` realm role assigned.\n+\n+We can now use this configuration with Kafka's CLI tools.\n+\n+\n+### Producing the Messages\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages to topic 'my-topic':\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic my-topic \\\n+  --producer.config=/tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+```\n+\n+When we press `Enter` to push the first message we receive `Not authorized to access topics: [my-topic]` error.\n+\n+`team-a-client` has a `Dev Team A` role which gives it permissions to do anything on topics that start with 'a_', and only write to topics that start with 'x_'.\n+The topic named `my-topic` matches neither of those.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application, and let's try to write to topic `a_messages`.\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+  --producer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+Second message\n+```\n+\n+Although we can see some unrelated warnings, looking at the Kafka container log there is DEBUG level output saying 'Authorization GRANTED'.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application.\n+\n+You can see the Kafka container log by running:\n+\n+    kubectl logs my-cluster-kafka-0 -f\n+\n+### Consuming the Messages\n+\n+Let's now try to consume the messages we have produced.\n+\n+    bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+      --from-beginning --consumer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+\n+This gives us an error like: `Not authorized to access group: console-consumer-55841`.\n+\n+The reason is that we have to override the default consumer group name -

con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-authorization-services.adoc\n+\n+[id='con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-example_{context}']\n+= Example authorization rules configuration using Authorization Services\n+\n+This is an end-to-end example of using Keycloak Authorization Services to configure authorization rules for use with `keycloak` authorization in Strimzi.\n+The example starts by deploying the Keycloak server with pre-configured realms, requiring no additional configuration.\n+We deploy the Kafka cluster configured to use one of the pre-configured realms.\n+We connect to the Keycloak Admin Console and demonstrate the sections of the user interface where authorizations rules are configured.\n+We use Kafka CLI client tools with different personal and service accounts to demonstrate limited access based on the permissions granted to different accounts.\n+\n+\n+== Token Based Authorization with Keycloak Authorization Services\n+\n+Once the Kafka Broker has obtained an access token by using `oauth` authentication, it is possible to use centrally managed authorization rules to enforce access restrictions onto Kafka Clients.\n+For this, Strimzi Kafka Operator comes with `keycloak` authorization which uses Keycloak Authorization Services to centrally manage permissions.\n+\n+When using `keycloak` authorization a custom authorizer is configured on the Kafka Broker that uses Authorization Services REST endpoints available on Keycloak, which provide a list of granted permissions on resources for authenticated users.\n+The list of grants (permissions) is fetched as the first action after an authenticated session is established by the Kafka client, and then regularly refreshed in the background.\n+Grants are cached and enforced locally on the Kafka Broker for each user session to provide fast authorization decisions. Because they are refreshed, any changes to the grants on the Keycloak server are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+== Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/examples/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/examples\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for Keycloak\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` (for example, `default`), use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+----\n+\n+\n+== Using the Keycloak Admin Console to configure authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+----\n+\n+Use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as username and password.\n+\n+In the upper left corner under the Keycloak icon you should see `Master` selected as the current realm.\n+Moving the mouse pointer over it should reveal two additional realms - `Demo` and `Kafka-authz`.\n+\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Selecting it will open the `Realm Settings` for the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+From the *Realm Settings* you can navigate to  *Groups*, *Roles*, *Clients* and *Users*.\n+\n+Under *Groups*, you can view groups to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with a name assigned. Typically, they are used to compartmentalize users into geographical, organizational or departmental units, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make a user a member of a group through a custom LDAP server admin user interface, for example, to grant them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under *Users*, when viewing all users you will see two users defined: `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under *Roles*, you can view the realm roles to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to _tag_ users with organizational roles and have the requisite permissions.\n+Roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider. If LDAP is a requirement, you could use groups instead.\n+\n+Under *Clients*, you can view the additional client configurations: `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth 2.0 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth 2.0 client authentication.\n+This client also contains the Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client from the *Authorization* tab, which becomes visible when *Authorization Enabled* is switched on from the *Settings* tab.\n+\n+\n+== Defining Authorization Services for access control\n+\n+Keycloak Authorization Services use authorization scopes, policies and permissions to define and apply access control to resources.\n+\n+Resources define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of authorization scopes - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+Policies define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, permissions tie together the resources, authorization scopes and policies that specify _users U can perform actions A on resource R_.\n+\n+For more information about Keycloak Authorization Services, see {keycloak-authorization-services}, but note that the Authorization Services documentation is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources rather than access to Kafka.\n+\n+When viewing resources from the Keycloak user interface you will see a list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers, patterns in a specific format that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+For example, this pattern targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_':\n+\n+----\n+kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*  \n+---- \n+\n+If a cluster is not specified by name ( `kafka-cluster:cluster-1`), the specifier targets any cluster. For example, this pattern targets any cluster with a name starting  'x_':\n+----\n+Group:x_* \n+----\n+\n+\n+The possible resource types, such as `Topic`, `Group` and `Cluster`, mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model].\n+\n+*Authorization Scopes* lists of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on specific resources.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+The list of actions mirrors Kafka permissions and is the same for any deployment.\n+\n+Rather than importing authorization scopes manually into every new client, you can use a link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file.\n+\n+You must make sure that the client is enabled in Keycloak for Authorization Services. After which, you can import a JSON file from the *Authorization* tab. You can see the loaded scopes from the *Authorization Scopes* page.\n+\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+The *Policies* tab has filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the roles, or groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be defined programmatically using JavaScript so the logic considers the context of the client session, such as the IP of a Kafka client.\n+\n+The *Permissions* tab defines role bindings that associate resources, authorization scopes and policies for applying a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Use a clear, descriptive name for each permission definition so that it is obvious what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+----\n+Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+----\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+== Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties << EOF\n+security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT\n+sasl.mechanism=OAUTHBEARER\n+sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required \\\n+  oauth.client.id=\"team-a-client\" \\\n+  oauth.client.secret=\"team-a-client-secret\" \\\n+  oauth.token.endpoint.uri=\"http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/kafka-authz/protocol/openid-connect/token\" ;\n+sasl.login.callback.handler.class=io.strimzi.kafka.oauth.client.JaasClientOauthLoginCallbackHandler\n+EOF\n+```\n+\n+In the Keycloak Console you can find which roles are assigned to the `team-a-client` service account, by selecting `team-a-client` in the `Clients` section.\n+and then opening the `Service Account Roles` tab for the client.\n+You should see the `Dev Team A` realm role assigned.\n+\n+We can now use this configuration with Kafka's CLI tools.\n+\n+\n+### Producing the Messages\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages to topic 'my-topic':\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic my-topic \\\n+  --producer.config=/tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+```\n+\n+When we press `Enter` to push the first message we receive `Not authorized to access topics: [my-topic]` error.\n+\n+`team-a-client` has a `Dev Team A` role which gives it permissions to do anything on topics that start with 'a_', and only write to topics that start with 'x_'.\n+The topic named `my-topic` matches neither of those.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application, and let's try to write to topic `a_messages`.\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+  --producer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+Second message\n+```\n+\n+Although we can see some unrelated warnings, looking at the Kafka container log there is DEBUG level output saying 'Authorization GRANTED'.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application.\n+\n+You can see the Kafka container log by running:\n+\n+    kubectl logs my-cluster-kafka-0 -f\n+\n+### Consuming the Messages\n+\n+Let's now try to consume the messages we have produced.\n+\n+    bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+      --from-beginning --consumer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+\n+This gives us an error like: `Not authorized to access group: console-consumer-55841`.\n+\n+The reason is that we have to override the default consumer group name -

Because they are refreshed, any changes to the grants on the Keycloak server are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+== Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/examples/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/examples\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for Keycloak\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` (for example, `default`), use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+----\n+\n+\n+== Using the Keycloak Admin Console to configure authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+----\n+\n+Use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as username and password.\n+\n+In the upper left corner under the Keycloak icon you should see `Master` selected as the current realm.\n+Moving the mouse pointer over it should reveal two additional realms - `Demo` and `Kafka-authz`.\n+\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Selecting it will open the `Realm Settings` for the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+From the *Realm Settings* you can navigate to  *Groups*, *Roles*, *Clients* and *Users*.\n+\n+Under *Groups*, you can view groups to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with a name assigned. Typically, they are used to compartmentalize users into geographical, organizational or departmental units, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make a user a member of a group through a custom LDAP server admin user interface, for example, to grant them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under *Users*, when viewing all users you will see two users defined: `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under *Roles*, you can view the realm roles to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to _tag_ users with organizational roles and have the requisite permissions.\n+Roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider. If LDAP is a requirement, you could use groups instead.\n+\n+Under *Clients*, you can view the additional client configurations: `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth 2.0 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth 2.0 client authentication.\n+This client also contains the Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client from the *Authorization* tab, which becomes visible when *Authorization Enabled* is switched on from the *Settings* tab.\n+\n+\n+== Defining Authorization Services for access control\n+\n+Keycloak Authorization Services use authorization scopes, policies and permissions to define and apply access control to resources.\n+\n+Resources define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of authorization scopes - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+Policies define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, permissions tie together the resources, authorization scopes and policies that specify _users U can perform actions A on resource R_.\n+\n+For more information about Keycloak Authorization Services, see {keycloak-authorization-services}, but note that the Authorization Services documentation is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources rather than access to Kafka.\n+\n+When viewing resources from the Keycloak user interface you will see a list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers, patterns in a specific format that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+For example, this pattern targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_':\n+\n+----\n+kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*  \n+---- \n+\n+If a cluster is not specified by name ( `kafka-cluster:cluster-1`), the specifier targets any cluster. For example, this pattern targets any cluster with a name starting  'x_':\n+----\n+Group:x_* \n+----\n+\n+\n+The possible resource types, such as `Topic`, `Group` and `Cluster`, mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model].\n+\n+*Authorization Scopes* lists of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on specific resources.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+The list of actions mirrors Kafka permissions and is the same for any deployment.\n+\n+Rather than importing authorization scopes manually into every new client, you can use a link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file.\n+\n+You must make sure that the client is enabled in Keycloak for Authorization Services. After which, you can import a JSON file from the *Authorization* tab. You can see the loaded scopes from the *Authorization Scopes* page.\n+\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+The *Policies* tab has filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the roles, or groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be defined programmatically using JavaScript so the logic considers the context of the client session, such as the IP of a Kafka client.\n+\n+The *Permissions* tab defines role bindings that associate resources, authorization scopes and policies for applying a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Use a clear, descriptive name for each permission definition so that it is obvious what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+----\n+Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+----\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+== Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties << EOF\n+security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT\n+sasl.mechanism=OAUTHBEARER\n+sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required \\\n+  oauth.client.id=\"team-a-client\" \\\n+  oauth.client.secret=\"team-a-client-secret\" \\\n+  oauth.token.endpoint.uri=\"http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/kafka-authz/protocol/openid-connect/token\" ;\n+sasl.login.callback.handler.class=io.strimzi.kafka.oauth.client.JaasClientOauthLoginCallbackHandler\n+EOF\n+```\n+\n+In the Keycloak Console you can find which roles are assigned to the `team-a-client` service account, by selecting `team-a-client` in the `Clients` section.\n+and then opening the `Service Account Roles` tab for the client.\n+You should see the `Dev Team A` realm role assigned.\n+\n+We can now use this configuration with Kafka's CLI tools.\n+\n+\n+### Producing the Messages\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages to topic 'my-topic':\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic my-topic \\\n+  --producer.config=/tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+```\n+\n+When we press `Enter` to push the first message we receive `Not authorized to access topics: [my-topic]` error.\n+\n+`team-a-client` has a `Dev Team A` role which gives it permissions to do anything on topics that start with 'a_', and only write to topics that start with 'x_'.\n+The topic named `my-topic` matches neither of those.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application, and let's try to write to topic `a_messages`.\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+  --producer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+Second message\n+```\n+\n+Although we can see some unrelated warnings, looking at the Kafka container log there is DEBUG level output saying 'Authorization GRANTED'.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application.\n+\n+You can see the Kafka container log by running:\n+\n+    kubectl logs my-cluster-kafka-0 -f\n+\n+### Consuming the Messages\n+\n+Let's now try to consume the messages we have produced.\n+\n+    bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+      --from-beginning --consumer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+\n+This gives us an error like: `Not authorized to access group: console-consumer-55841`.\n+\n+The reason is that we have to override the default consumer group name -

the following module:\n+//\n+// con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-authorization-services.adoc\n+\n+[id='con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-example_{context}']\n+= Example authorization rules configuration using Authorization Services\n+\n+This is an end-to-end example of using Keycloak Authorization Services to configure authorization rules for use with `keycloak` authorization in Strimzi.\n+The example starts by deploying the Keycloak server with pre-configured realms, requiring no additional configuration.\n+We deploy the Kafka cluster configured to use one of the pre-configured realms.\n+We connect to the Keycloak Admin Console and demonstrate the sections of the user interface where authorizations rules are configured.\n+We use Kafka CLI client tools with different personal and service accounts to demonstrate limited access based on the permissions granted to different accounts.\n+\n+\n+== Token Based Authorization with Keycloak Authorization Services\n+\n+Once the Kafka Broker has obtained an access token by using `oauth` authentication, it is possible to use centrally managed authorization rules to enforce access restrictions onto Kafka Clients.\n+For this, Strimzi Kafka Operator comes with `keycloak` authorization which uses Keycloak Authorization Services to centrally manage permissions.\n+\n+When using `keycloak` authorization a custom authorizer is configured on the Kafka Broker that uses Authorization Services REST endpoints available on Keycloak, which provide a list of granted permissions on resources for authenticated users.\n+The list of grants (permissions) is fetched as the first action after an authenticated session is established by the Kafka client, and then regularly refreshed in the background.\n+Grants are cached and enforced locally on the Kafka Broker for each user session to provide fast authorization decisions. Because they are refreshed, any changes to the grants on the Keycloak server are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+== Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/examples/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/examples\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for Keycloak\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` (for example, `default`), use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+----\n+\n+\n+== Using the Keycloak Admin Console to configure authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+----\n+\n+Use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as username and password.\n+\n+In the upper left corner under the Keycloak icon you should see `Master` selected as the current realm.\n+Moving the mouse pointer over it should reveal two additional realms - `Demo` and `Kafka-authz`.\n+\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Selecting it will open the `Realm Settings` for the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+From the *Realm Settings* you can navigate to  *Groups*, *Roles*, *Clients* and *Users*.\n+\n+Under *Groups*, you can view groups to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with a name assigned. Typically, they are used to compartmentalize users into geographical, organizational or departmental units, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make a user a member of a group through a custom LDAP server admin user interface, for example, to grant them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under *Users*, when viewing all users you will see two users defined: `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under *Roles*, you can view the realm roles to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to _tag_ users with organizational roles and have the requisite permissions.\n+Roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider. If LDAP is a requirement, you could use groups instead.\n+\n+Under *Clients*, you can view the additional client configurations: `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth 2.0 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth 2.0 client authentication.\n+This client also contains the Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client from the *Authorization* tab, which becomes visible when *Authorization Enabled* is switched on from the *Settings* tab.\n+\n+\n+== Defining Authorization Services for access control\n+\n+Keycloak Authorization Services use authorization scopes, policies and permissions to define and apply access control to resources.\n+\n+Resources define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of authorization scopes - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+Policies define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, permissions tie together the resources, authorization scopes and policies that specify _users U can perform actions A on resource R_.\n+\n+For more information about Keycloak Authorization Services, see {keycloak-authorization-services}, but note that the Authorization Services documentation is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources rather than access to Kafka.\n+\n+When viewing resources from the Keycloak user interface you will see a list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers, patterns in a specific format that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+For example, this pattern targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_':\n+\n+----\n+kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*  \n+---- \n+\n+If a cluster is not specified by name ( `kafka-cluster:cluster-1`), the specifier targets any cluster. For example, this pattern targets any cluster with a name starting  'x_':\n+----\n+Group:x_* \n+----\n+\n+\n+The possible resource types, such as `Topic`, `Group` and `Cluster`, mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model].\n+\n+*Authorization Scopes* lists of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on specific resources.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+The list of actions mirrors Kafka permissions and is the same for any deployment.\n+\n+Rather than importing authorization scopes manually into every new client, you can use a link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file.\n+\n+You must make sure that the client is enabled in Keycloak for Authorization Services. After which, you can import a JSON file from the *Authorization* tab. You can see the loaded scopes from the *Authorization Scopes* page.\n+\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+The *Policies* tab has filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the roles, or groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be defined programmatically using JavaScript so the logic considers the context of the client session, such as the IP of a Kafka client.\n+\n+The *Permissions* tab defines role bindings that associate resources, authorization scopes and policies for applying a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Use a clear, descriptive name for each permission definition so that it is obvious what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+----\n+Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+----\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+== Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties << EOF\n+security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT\n+sasl.mechanism=OAUTHBEARER\n+sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required \\\n+  oauth.client.id=\"team-a-client\" \\\n+  oauth.client.secret=\"team-a-client-secret\" \\\n+  oauth.token.endpoint.uri=\"http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/kafka-authz/protocol/openid-connect/token\" ;\n+sasl.login.callback.handler.class=io.strimzi.kafka.oauth.client.JaasClientOauthLoginCallbackHandler\n+EOF\n+```\n+\n+In the Keycloak Console you can find which roles are assigned to the `team-a-client` service account, by selecting `team-a-client` in the `Clients` section.\n+and then opening the `Service Account Roles` tab for the client.\n+You should see the `Dev Team A` realm role assigned.\n+\n+We can now use this configuration with Kafka's CLI tools.\n+\n+\n+### Producing the Messages\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages to topic 'my-topic':\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic my-topic \\\n+  --producer.config=/tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+```\n+\n+When we press `Enter` to push the first message we receive `Not authorized to access topics: [my-topic]` error.\n+\n+`team-a-client` has a `Dev Team A` role which gives it permissions to do anything on topics that start with 'a_', and only write to topics that start with 'x_'.\n+The topic named `my-topic` matches neither of those.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application, and let's try to write to topic `a_messages`.\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+  --producer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+Second message\n+```\n+\n+Although we can see some unrelated warnings, looking at the Kafka container log there is DEBUG level output saying 'Authorization GRANTED'.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application.\n+\n+You can see the Kafka container log by running:\n+\n+    kubectl logs my-cluster-kafka-0 -f\n+\n+### Consuming the Messages\n+\n+Let's now try to consume the messages we have produced.\n+\n+    bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+      --from-beginning --consumer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+\n+This gives us an error like: `Not authorized to access group: console-consumer-55841`.\n+\n+The reason is that we have to override the default consumer group name -

Because they are refreshed, any changes to the grants on the Keycloak server are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+== Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/examples/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/examples\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for Keycloak\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` (for example, `default`), use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+----\n+\n+\n+== Using the Keycloak Admin Console to configure authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+----\n+\n+Use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as username and password.\n+\n+In the upper left corner under the Keycloak icon you should see `Master` selected as the current realm.\n+Moving the mouse pointer over it should reveal two additional realms - `Demo` and `Kafka-authz`.\n+\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Selecting it will open the `Realm Settings` for the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+From the *Realm Settings* you can navigate to  *Groups*, *Roles*, *Clients* and *Users*.\n+\n+Under *Groups*, you can view groups to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with a name assigned. Typically, they are used to compartmentalize users into geographical, organizational or departmental units, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make a user a member of a group through a custom LDAP server admin user interface, for example, to grant them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under *Users*, when viewing all users you will see two users defined: `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under *Roles*, you can view the realm roles to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to _tag_ users with organizational roles and have the requisite permissions.\n+Roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider. If LDAP is a requirement, you could use groups instead.\n+\n+Under *Clients*, you can view the additional client configurations: `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth 2.0 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth 2.0 client authentication.\n+This client also contains the Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client from the *Authorization* tab, which becomes visible when *Authorization Enabled* is switched on from the *Settings* tab.\n+\n+\n+== Defining Authorization Services for access control\n+\n+Keycloak Authorization Services use authorization scopes, policies and permissions to define and apply access control to resources.\n+\n+Resources define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of authorization scopes - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+Policies define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, permissions tie together the resources, authorization scopes and policies that specify _users U can perform actions A on resource R_.\n+\n+For more information about Keycloak Authorization Services, see {keycloak-authorization-services}, but note that the Authorization Services documentation is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources rather than access to Kafka.\n+\n+When viewing resources from the Keycloak user interface you will see a list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers, patterns in a specific format that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+For example, this pattern targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_':\n+\n+----\n+kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*  \n+---- \n+\n+If a cluster is not specified by name ( `kafka-cluster:cluster-1`), the specifier targets any cluster. For example, this pattern targets any cluster with a name starting  'x_':\n+----\n+Group:x_* \n+----\n+\n+\n+The possible resource types, such as `Topic`, `Group` and `Cluster`, mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model].\n+\n+*Authorization Scopes* lists of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on specific resources.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+The list of actions mirrors Kafka permissions and is the same for any deployment.\n+\n+Rather than importing authorization scopes manually into every new client, you can use a link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file.\n+\n+You must make sure that the client is enabled in Keycloak for Authorization Services. After which, you can import a JSON file from the *Authorization* tab. You can see the loaded scopes from the *Authorization Scopes* page.\n+\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+The *Policies* tab has filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the roles, or groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be defined programmatically using JavaScript so the logic considers the context of the client session, such as the IP of a Kafka client.\n+\n+The *Permissions* tab defines role bindings that associate resources, authorization scopes and policies for applying a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Use a clear, descriptive name for each permission definition so that it is obvious what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+----\n+Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+----\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+== Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties << EOF\n+security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT\n+sasl.mechanism=OAUTHBEARER\n+sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required \\\n+  oauth.client.id=\"team-a-client\" \\\n+  oauth.client.secret=\"team-a-client-secret\" \\\n+  oauth.token.endpoint.uri=\"http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/kafka-authz/protocol/openid-connect/token\" ;\n+sasl.login.callback.handler.class=io.strimzi.kafka.oauth.client.JaasClientOauthLoginCallbackHandler\n+EOF\n+```\n+\n+In the Keycloak Console you can find which roles are assigned to the `team-a-client` service account, by selecting `team-a-client` in the `Clients` section.\n+and then opening the `Service Account Roles` tab for the client.\n+You should see the `Dev Team A` realm role assigned.\n+\n+We can now use this configuration with Kafka's CLI tools.\n+\n+\n+### Producing the Messages\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages to topic 'my-topic':\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic my-topic \\\n+  --producer.config=/tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+```\n+\n+When we press `Enter` to push the first message we receive `Not authorized to access topics: [my-topic]` error.\n+\n+`team-a-client` has a `Dev Team A` role which gives it permissions to do anything on topics that start with 'a_', and only write to topics that start with 'x_'.\n+The topic named `my-topic` matches neither of those.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application, and let's try to write to topic `a_messages`.\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+  --producer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+Second message\n+```\n+\n+Although we can see some unrelated warnings, looking at the Kafka container log there is DEBUG level output saying 'Authorization GRANTED'.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application.\n+\n+You can see the Kafka container log by running:\n+\n+    kubectl logs my-cluster-kafka-0 -f\n+\n+### Consuming the Messages\n+\n+Let's now try to consume the messages we have produced.\n+\n+    bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+      --from-beginning --consumer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+\n+This gives us an error like: `Not authorized to access group: console-consumer-55841`.\n+\n+The reason is that we have to override the default consumer group name -

con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-authorization-services.adoc\n+\n+[id='con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-example_{context}']\n+= Example authorization rules configuration using Authorization Services\n+\n+This is an end-to-end example of using Keycloak Authorization Services to configure authorization rules for use with `keycloak` authorization in Strimzi.\n+The example starts by deploying the Keycloak server with pre-configured realms, requiring no additional configuration.\n+We deploy the Kafka cluster configured to use one of the pre-configured realms.\n+We connect to the Keycloak Admin Console and demonstrate the sections of the user interface where authorizations rules are configured.\n+We use Kafka CLI client tools with different personal and service accounts to demonstrate limited access based on the permissions granted to different accounts.\n+\n+\n+== Token Based Authorization with Keycloak Authorization Services\n+\n+Once the Kafka Broker has obtained an access token by using `oauth` authentication, it is possible to use centrally managed authorization rules to enforce access restrictions onto Kafka Clients.\n+For this, Strimzi Kafka Operator comes with `keycloak` authorization which uses Keycloak Authorization Services to centrally manage permissions.\n+\n+When using `keycloak` authorization a custom authorizer is configured on the Kafka Broker that uses Authorization Services REST endpoints available on Keycloak, which provide a list of granted permissions on resources for authenticated users.\n+The list of grants (permissions) is fetched as the first action after an authenticated session is established by the Kafka client, and then regularly refreshed in the background.\n+Grants are cached and enforced locally on the Kafka Broker for each user session to provide fast authorization decisions. Because they are refreshed, any changes to the grants on the Keycloak server are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+== Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/examples/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/examples\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for Keycloak\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` (for example, `default`), use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+----\n+\n+\n+== Using the Keycloak Admin Console to configure authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+----\n+\n+Use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as username and password.\n+\n+In the upper left corner under the Keycloak icon you should see `Master` selected as the current realm.\n+Moving the mouse pointer over it should reveal two additional realms - `Demo` and `Kafka-authz`.\n+\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Selecting it will open the `Realm Settings` for the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+From the *Realm Settings* you can navigate to  *Groups*, *Roles*, *Clients* and *Users*.\n+\n+Under *Groups*, you can view groups to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with a name assigned. Typically, they are used to compartmentalize users into geographical, organizational or departmental units, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make a user a member of a group through a custom LDAP server admin user interface, for example, to grant them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under *Users*, when viewing all users you will see two users defined: `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under *Roles*, you can view the realm roles to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to _tag_ users with organizational roles and have the requisite permissions.\n+Roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider. If LDAP is a requirement, you could use groups instead.\n+\n+Under *Clients*, you can view the additional client configurations: `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth 2.0 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth 2.0 client authentication.\n+This client also contains the Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client from the *Authorization* tab, which becomes visible when *Authorization Enabled* is switched on from the *Settings* tab.\n+\n+\n+== Defining Authorization Services for access control\n+\n+Keycloak Authorization Services use authorization scopes, policies and permissions to define and apply access control to resources.\n+\n+Resources define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of authorization scopes - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+Policies define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, permissions tie together the resources, authorization scopes and policies that specify _users U can perform actions A on resource R_.\n+\n+For more information about Keycloak Authorization Services, see {keycloak-authorization-services}, but note that the Authorization Services documentation is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources rather than access to Kafka.\n+\n+When viewing resources from the Keycloak user interface you will see a list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers, patterns in a specific format that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+For example, this pattern targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_':\n+\n+----\n+kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*  \n+---- \n+\n+If a cluster is not specified by name ( `kafka-cluster:cluster-1`), the specifier targets any cluster. For example, this pattern targets any cluster with a name starting  'x_':\n+----\n+Group:x_* \n+----\n+\n+\n+The possible resource types, such as `Topic`, `Group` and `Cluster`, mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model].\n+\n+*Authorization Scopes* lists of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on specific resources.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+The list of actions mirrors Kafka permissions and is the same for any deployment.\n+\n+Rather than importing authorization scopes manually into every new client, you can use a link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file.\n+\n+You must make sure that the client is enabled in Keycloak for Authorization Services. After which, you can import a JSON file from the *Authorization* tab. You can see the loaded scopes from the *Authorization Scopes* page.\n+\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+The *Policies* tab has filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the roles, or groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be defined programmatically using JavaScript so the logic considers the context of the client session, such as the IP of a Kafka client.\n+\n+The *Permissions* tab defines role bindings that associate resources, authorization scopes and policies for applying a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Use a clear, descriptive name for each permission definition so that it is obvious what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+----\n+Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+----\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+== Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties << EOF\n+security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT\n+sasl.mechanism=OAUTHBEARER\n+sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required \\\n+  oauth.client.id=\"team-a-client\" \\\n+  oauth.client.secret=\"team-a-client-secret\" \\\n+  oauth.token.endpoint.uri=\"http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/kafka-authz/protocol/openid-connect/token\" ;\n+sasl.login.callback.handler.class=io.strimzi.kafka.oauth.client.JaasClientOauthLoginCallbackHandler\n+EOF\n+```\n+\n+In the Keycloak Console you can find which roles are assigned to the `team-a-client` service account, by selecting `team-a-client` in the `Clients` section.\n+and then opening the `Service Account Roles` tab for the client.\n+You should see the `Dev Team A` realm role assigned.\n+\n+We can now use this configuration with Kafka's CLI tools.\n+\n+\n+### Producing the Messages\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages to topic 'my-topic':\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic my-topic \\\n+  --producer.config=/tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+```\n+\n+When we press `Enter` to push the first message we receive `Not authorized to access topics: [my-topic]` error.\n+\n+`team-a-client` has a `Dev Team A` role which gives it permissions to do anything on topics that start with 'a_', and only write to topics that start with 'x_'.\n+The topic named `my-topic` matches neither of those.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application, and let's try to write to topic `a_messages`.\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+  --producer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+Second message\n+```\n+\n+Although we can see some unrelated warnings, looking at the Kafka container log there is DEBUG level output saying 'Authorization GRANTED'.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application.\n+\n+You can see the Kafka container log by running:\n+\n+    kubectl logs my-cluster-kafka-0 -f\n+\n+### Consuming the Messages\n+\n+Let's now try to consume the messages we have produced.\n+\n+    bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+      --from-beginning --consumer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+\n+This gives us an error like: `Not authorized to access group: console-consumer-55841`.\n+\n+The reason is that we have to override the default consumer group name -

con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-authorization-services.adoc\n+\n+[id='con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-example_{context}']\n+= Example authorization rules configuration using Authorization Services\n+\n+This is an end-to-end example of using Keycloak Authorization Services to configure authorization rules for use with `keycloak` authorization in Strimzi.\n+The example starts by deploying the Keycloak server with pre-configured realms, requiring no additional configuration.\n+We deploy the Kafka cluster configured to use one of the pre-configured realms.\n+We connect to the Keycloak Admin Console and demonstrate the sections of the user interface where authorizations rules are configured.\n+We use Kafka CLI client tools with different personal and service accounts to demonstrate limited access based on the permissions granted to different accounts.\n+\n+\n+== Token Based Authorization with Keycloak Authorization Services\n+\n+Once the Kafka Broker has obtained an access token by using `oauth` authentication, it is possible to use centrally managed authorization rules to enforce access restrictions onto Kafka Clients.\n+For this, Strimzi Kafka Operator comes with `keycloak` authorization which uses Keycloak Authorization Services to centrally manage permissions.\n+\n+When using `keycloak` authorization a custom authorizer is configured on the Kafka Broker that uses Authorization Services REST endpoints available on Keycloak, which provide a list of granted permissions on resources for authenticated users.\n+The list of grants (permissions) is fetched as the first action after an authenticated session is established by the Kafka client, and then regularly refreshed in the background.\n+Grants are cached and enforced locally on the Kafka Broker for each user session to provide fast authorization decisions. Because they are refreshed, any changes to the grants on the Keycloak server are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+== Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/examples/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/examples\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for Keycloak\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` (for example, `default`), use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+----\n+\n+\n+== Using the Keycloak Admin Console to configure authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+----\n+\n+Use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as username and password.\n+\n+In the upper left corner under the Keycloak icon you should see `Master` selected as the current realm.\n+Moving the mouse pointer over it should reveal two additional realms - `Demo` and `Kafka-authz`.\n+\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Selecting it will open the `Realm Settings` for the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+From the *Realm Settings* you can navigate to  *Groups*, *Roles*, *Clients* and *Users*.\n+\n+Under *Groups*, you can view groups to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with a name assigned. Typically, they are used to compartmentalize users into geographical, organizational or departmental units, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make a user a member of a group through a custom LDAP server admin user interface, for example, to grant them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under *Users*, when viewing all users you will see two users defined: `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under *Roles*, you can view the realm roles to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to _tag_ users with organizational roles and have the requisite permissions.\n+Roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider. If LDAP is a requirement, you could use groups instead.\n+\n+Under *Clients*, you can view the additional client configurations: `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth 2.0 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth 2.0 client authentication.\n+This client also contains the Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client from the *Authorization* tab, which becomes visible when *Authorization Enabled* is switched on from the *Settings* tab.\n+\n+\n+== Defining Authorization Services for access control\n+\n+Keycloak Authorization Services use authorization scopes, policies and permissions to define and apply access control to resources.\n+\n+Resources define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of authorization scopes - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+Policies define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, permissions tie together the resources, authorization scopes and policies that specify _users U can perform actions A on resource R_.\n+\n+For more information about Keycloak Authorization Services, see {keycloak-authorization-services}, but note that the Authorization Services documentation is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources rather than access to Kafka.\n+\n+When viewing resources from the Keycloak user interface you will see a list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers, patterns in a specific format that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+For example, this pattern targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_':\n+\n+----\n+kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*  \n+---- \n+\n+If a cluster is not specified by name ( `kafka-cluster:cluster-1`), the specifier targets any cluster. For example, this pattern targets any cluster with a name starting  'x_':\n+----\n+Group:x_* \n+----\n+\n+\n+The possible resource types, such as `Topic`, `Group` and `Cluster`, mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model].\n+\n+*Authorization Scopes* lists of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on specific resources.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+The list of actions mirrors Kafka permissions and is the same for any deployment.\n+\n+Rather than importing authorization scopes manually into every new client, you can use a link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file.\n+\n+You must make sure that the client is enabled in Keycloak for Authorization Services. After which, you can import a JSON file from the *Authorization* tab. You can see the loaded scopes from the *Authorization Scopes* page.\n+\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+The *Policies* tab has filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the roles, or groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be defined programmatically using JavaScript so the logic considers the context of the client session, such as the IP of a Kafka client.\n+\n+The *Permissions* tab defines role bindings that associate resources, authorization scopes and policies for applying a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Use a clear, descriptive name for each permission definition so that it is obvious what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+----\n+Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+----\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+== Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties << EOF\n+security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT\n+sasl.mechanism=OAUTHBEARER\n+sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required \\\n+  oauth.client.id=\"team-a-client\" \\\n+  oauth.client.secret=\"team-a-client-secret\" \\\n+  oauth.token.endpoint.uri=\"http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/kafka-authz/protocol/openid-connect/token\" ;\n+sasl.login.callback.handler.class=io.strimzi.kafka.oauth.client.JaasClientOauthLoginCallbackHandler\n+EOF\n+```\n+\n+In the Keycloak Console you can find which roles are assigned to the `team-a-client` service account, by selecting `team-a-client` in the `Clients` section.\n+and then opening the `Service Account Roles` tab for the client.\n+You should see the `Dev Team A` realm role assigned.\n+\n+We can now use this configuration with Kafka's CLI tools.\n+\n+\n+### Producing the Messages\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages to topic 'my-topic':\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic my-topic \\\n+  --producer.config=/tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+```\n+\n+When we press `Enter` to push the first message we receive `Not authorized to access topics: [my-topic]` error.\n+\n+`team-a-client` has a `Dev Team A` role which gives it permissions to do anything on topics that start with 'a_', and only write to topics that start with 'x_'.\n+The topic named `my-topic` matches neither of those.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application, and let's try to write to topic `a_messages`.\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+  --producer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+Second message\n+```\n+\n+Although we can see some unrelated warnings, looking at the Kafka container log there is DEBUG level output saying 'Authorization GRANTED'.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application.\n+\n+You can see the Kafka container log by running:\n+\n+    kubectl logs my-cluster-kafka-0 -f\n+\n+### Consuming the Messages\n+\n+Let's now try to consume the messages we have produced.\n+\n+    bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+      --from-beginning --consumer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+\n+This gives us an error like: `Not authorized to access group: console-consumer-55841`.\n+\n+The reason is that we have to override the default consumer group name -

con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-authorization-services.adoc\n+\n+[id='con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-example_{context}']\n+= Example authorization rules configuration using Authorization Services\n+\n+This is an end-to-end example of using Keycloak Authorization Services to configure authorization rules for use with `keycloak` authorization in Strimzi.\n+The example starts by deploying the Keycloak server with pre-configured realms, requiring no additional configuration.\n+We deploy the Kafka cluster configured to use one of the pre-configured realms.\n+We connect to the Keycloak Admin Console and demonstrate the sections of the user interface where authorizations rules are configured.\n+We use Kafka CLI client tools with different personal and service accounts to demonstrate limited access based on the permissions granted to different accounts.\n+\n+\n+== Token Based Authorization with Keycloak Authorization Services\n+\n+Once the Kafka Broker has obtained an access token by using `oauth` authentication, it is possible to use centrally managed authorization rules to enforce access restrictions onto Kafka Clients.\n+For this, Strimzi Kafka Operator comes with `keycloak` authorization which uses Keycloak Authorization Services to centrally manage permissions.\n+\n+When using `keycloak` authorization a custom authorizer is configured on the Kafka Broker that uses Authorization Services REST endpoints available on Keycloak, which provide a list of granted permissions on resources for authenticated users.\n+The list of grants (permissions) is fetched as the first action after an authenticated session is established by the Kafka client, and then regularly refreshed in the background.\n+Grants are cached and enforced locally on the Kafka Broker for each user session to provide fast authorization decisions. Because they are refreshed, any changes to the grants on the Keycloak server are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+== Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/examples/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/examples\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for Keycloak\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` (for example, `default`), use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+----\n+\n+\n+== Using the Keycloak Admin Console to configure authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+----\n+\n+Use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as username and password.\n+\n+In the upper left corner under the Keycloak icon you should see `Master` selected as the current realm.\n+Moving the mouse pointer over it should reveal two additional realms - `Demo` and `Kafka-authz`.\n+\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Selecting it will open the `Realm Settings` for the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+From the *Realm Settings* you can navigate to  *Groups*, *Roles*, *Clients* and *Users*.\n+\n+Under *Groups*, you can view groups to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with a name assigned. Typically, they are used to compartmentalize users into geographical, organizational or departmental units, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make a user a member of a group through a custom LDAP server admin user interface, for example, to grant them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under *Users*, when viewing all users you will see two users defined: `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under *Roles*, you can view the realm roles to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to _tag_ users with organizational roles and have the requisite permissions.\n+Roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider. If LDAP is a requirement, you could use groups instead.\n+\n+Under *Clients*, you can view the additional client configurations: `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth 2.0 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth 2.0 client authentication.\n+This client also contains the Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client from the *Authorization* tab, which becomes visible when *Authorization Enabled* is switched on from the *Settings* tab.\n+\n+\n+== Defining Authorization Services for access control\n+\n+Keycloak Authorization Services use authorization scopes, policies and permissions to define and apply access control to resources.\n+\n+Resources define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of authorization scopes - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+Policies define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, permissions tie together the resources, authorization scopes and policies that specify _users U can perform actions A on resource R_.\n+\n+For more information about Keycloak Authorization Services, see {keycloak-authorization-services}, but note that the Authorization Services documentation is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources rather than access to Kafka.\n+\n+When viewing resources from the Keycloak user interface you will see a list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers, patterns in a specific format that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+For example, this pattern targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_':\n+\n+----\n+kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*  \n+---- \n+\n+If a cluster is not specified by name ( `kafka-cluster:cluster-1`), the specifier targets any cluster. For example, this pattern targets any cluster with a name starting  'x_':\n+----\n+Group:x_* \n+----\n+\n+\n+The possible resource types, such as `Topic`, `Group` and `Cluster`, mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model].\n+\n+*Authorization Scopes* lists of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on specific resources.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+The list of actions mirrors Kafka permissions and is the same for any deployment.\n+\n+Rather than importing authorization scopes manually into every new client, you can use a link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file.\n+\n+You must make sure that the client is enabled in Keycloak for Authorization Services. After which, you can import a JSON file from the *Authorization* tab. You can see the loaded scopes from the *Authorization Scopes* page.\n+\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+The *Policies* tab has filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the roles, or groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be defined programmatically using JavaScript so the logic considers the context of the client session, such as the IP of a Kafka client.\n+\n+The *Permissions* tab defines role bindings that associate resources, authorization scopes and policies for applying a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Use a clear, descriptive name for each permission definition so that it is obvious what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+----\n+Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+----\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+== Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties << EOF\n+security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT\n+sasl.mechanism=OAUTHBEARER\n+sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required \\\n+  oauth.client.id=\"team-a-client\" \\\n+  oauth.client.secret=\"team-a-client-secret\" \\\n+  oauth.token.endpoint.uri=\"http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/kafka-authz/protocol/openid-connect/token\" ;\n+sasl.login.callback.handler.class=io.strimzi.kafka.oauth.client.JaasClientOauthLoginCallbackHandler\n+EOF\n+```\n+\n+In the Keycloak Console you can find which roles are assigned to the `team-a-client` service account, by selecting `team-a-client` in the `Clients` section.\n+and then opening the `Service Account Roles` tab for the client.\n+You should see the `Dev Team A` realm role assigned.\n+\n+We can now use this configuration with Kafka's CLI tools.\n+\n+\n+### Producing the Messages\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages to topic 'my-topic':\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic my-topic \\\n+  --producer.config=/tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+```\n+\n+When we press `Enter` to push the first message we receive `Not authorized to access topics: [my-topic]` error.\n+\n+`team-a-client` has a `Dev Team A` role which gives it permissions to do anything on topics that start with 'a_', and only write to topics that start with 'x_'.\n+The topic named `my-topic` matches neither of those.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application, and let's try to write to topic `a_messages`.\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+  --producer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+Second message\n+```\n+\n+Although we can see some unrelated warnings, looking at the Kafka container log there is DEBUG level output saying 'Authorization GRANTED'.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application.\n+\n+You can see the Kafka container log by running:\n+\n+    kubectl logs my-cluster-kafka-0 -f\n+\n+### Consuming the Messages\n+\n+Let's now try to consume the messages we have produced.\n+\n+    bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+      --from-beginning --consumer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+\n+This gives us an error like: `Not authorized to access group: console-consumer-55841`.\n+\n+The reason is that we have to override the default consumer group name -

Because they are refreshed, any changes to the grants on the Keycloak server are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+== Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/examples/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/examples\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for Keycloak\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` (for example, `default`), use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+----\n+\n+\n+== Using the Keycloak Admin Console to configure authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+----\n+\n+Use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as username and password.\n+\n+In the upper left corner under the Keycloak icon you should see `Master` selected as the current realm.\n+Moving the mouse pointer over it should reveal two additional realms - `Demo` and `Kafka-authz`.\n+\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Selecting it will open the `Realm Settings` for the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+From the *Realm Settings* you can navigate to  *Groups*, *Roles*, *Clients* and *Users*.\n+\n+Under *Groups*, you can view groups to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with a name assigned. Typically, they are used to compartmentalize users into geographical, organizational or departmental units, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make a user a member of a group through a custom LDAP server admin user interface, for example, to grant them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under *Users*, when viewing all users you will see two users defined: `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under *Roles*, you can view the realm roles to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to _tag_ users with organizational roles and have the requisite permissions.\n+Roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider. If LDAP is a requirement, you could use groups instead.\n+\n+Under *Clients*, you can view the additional client configurations: `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth 2.0 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth 2.0 client authentication.\n+This client also contains the Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client from the *Authorization* tab, which becomes visible when *Authorization Enabled* is switched on from the *Settings* tab.\n+\n+\n+== Defining Authorization Services for access control\n+\n+Keycloak Authorization Services use authorization scopes, policies and permissions to define and apply access control to resources.\n+\n+Resources define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of authorization scopes - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+Policies define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, permissions tie together the resources, authorization scopes and policies that specify _users U can perform actions A on resource R_.\n+\n+For more information about Keycloak Authorization Services, see {keycloak-authorization-services}, but note that the Authorization Services documentation is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources rather than access to Kafka.\n+\n+When viewing resources from the Keycloak user interface you will see a list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers, patterns in a specific format that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+For example, this pattern targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_':\n+\n+----\n+kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*  \n+---- \n+\n+If a cluster is not specified by name ( `kafka-cluster:cluster-1`), the specifier targets any cluster. For example, this pattern targets any cluster with a name starting  'x_':\n+----\n+Group:x_* \n+----\n+\n+\n+The possible resource types, such as `Topic`, `Group` and `Cluster`, mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model].\n+\n+*Authorization Scopes* lists of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on specific resources.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+The list of actions mirrors Kafka permissions and is the same for any deployment.\n+\n+Rather than importing authorization scopes manually into every new client, you can use a link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file.\n+\n+You must make sure that the client is enabled in Keycloak for Authorization Services. After which, you can import a JSON file from the *Authorization* tab. You can see the loaded scopes from the *Authorization Scopes* page.\n+\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+The *Policies* tab has filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the roles, or groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be defined programmatically using JavaScript so the logic considers the context of the client session, such as the IP of a Kafka client.\n+\n+The *Permissions* tab defines role bindings that associate resources, authorization scopes and policies for applying a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Use a clear, descriptive name for each permission definition so that it is obvious what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+----\n+Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+----\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+== Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution -

Because they are refreshed, any changes to the grants on the Keycloak server are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+== Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/examples/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/examples\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for Keycloak\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` (for example, `default`), use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+----\n+\n+\n+== Using the Keycloak Admin Console to configure authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+----\n+\n+Use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as username and password.\n+\n+In the upper left corner under the Keycloak icon you should see `Master` selected as the current realm.\n+Moving the mouse pointer over it should reveal two additional realms - `Demo` and `Kafka-authz`.\n+\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Selecting it will open the `Realm Settings` for the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+From the *Realm Settings* you can navigate to  *Groups*, *Roles*, *Clients* and *Users*.\n+\n+Under *Groups*, you can view groups to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with a name assigned. Typically, they are used to compartmentalize users into geographical, organizational or departmental units, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make a user a member of a group through a custom LDAP server admin user interface, for example, to grant them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under *Users*, when viewing all users you will see two users defined: `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under *Roles*, you can view the realm roles to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to _tag_ users with organizational roles and have the requisite permissions.\n+Roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider. If LDAP is a requirement, you could use groups instead.\n+\n+Under *Clients*, you can view the additional client configurations: `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth 2.0 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth 2.0 client authentication.\n+This client also contains the Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client from the *Authorization* tab, which becomes visible when *Authorization Enabled* is switched on from the *Settings* tab.\n+\n+\n+== Defining Authorization Services for access control\n+\n+Keycloak Authorization Services use authorization scopes, policies and permissions to define and apply access control to resources.\n+\n+Resources define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of authorization scopes - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+Policies define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, permissions tie together the resources, authorization scopes and policies that specify _users U can perform actions A on resource R_.\n+\n+For more information about Keycloak Authorization Services, see {keycloak-authorization-services}, but note that the Authorization Services documentation is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources rather than access to Kafka.\n+\n+When viewing resources from the Keycloak user interface you will see a list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers, patterns in a specific format that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+For example, this pattern targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_':\n+\n+----\n+kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*  \n+---- \n+\n+If a cluster is not specified by name ( `kafka-cluster:cluster-1`), the specifier targets any cluster. For example, this pattern targets any cluster with a name starting  'x_':\n+----\n+Group:x_* \n+----\n+\n+\n+The possible resource types, such as `Topic`, `Group` and `Cluster`, mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model].\n+\n+*Authorization Scopes* lists of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on specific resources.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+The list of actions mirrors Kafka permissions and is the same for any deployment.\n+\n+Rather than importing authorization scopes manually into every new client, you can use a link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file.\n+\n+You must make sure that the client is enabled in Keycloak for Authorization Services. After which, you can import a JSON file from the *Authorization* tab. You can see the loaded scopes from the *Authorization Scopes* page.\n+\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+The *Policies* tab has filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the roles, or groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be defined programmatically using JavaScript so the logic considers the context of the client session, such as the IP of a Kafka client.\n+\n+The *Permissions* tab defines role bindings that associate resources, authorization scopes and policies for applying a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Use a clear, descriptive name for each permission definition so that it is obvious what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+----\n+Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+----\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+== Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties << EOF\n+security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT\n+sasl.mechanism=OAUTHBEARER\n+sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required \\\n+  oauth.client.id=\"team-a-client\" \\\n+  oauth.client.secret=\"team-a-client-secret\" \\\n+  oauth.token.endpoint.uri=\"http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/kafka-authz/protocol/openid-connect/token\" ;\n+sasl.login.callback.handler.class=io.strimzi.kafka.oauth.client.JaasClientOauthLoginCallbackHandler\n+EOF\n+```\n+\n+In the Keycloak Console you can find which roles are assigned to the `team-a-client` service account, by selecting `team-a-client` in the `Clients` section.\n+and then opening the `Service Account Roles` tab for the client.\n+You should see the `Dev Team A` realm role assigned.\n+\n+We can now use this configuration with Kafka's CLI tools.\n+\n+\n+### Producing the Messages\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages to topic 'my-topic':\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic my-topic \\\n+  --producer.config=/tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+```\n+\n+When we press `Enter` to push the first message we receive `Not authorized to access topics: [my-topic]` error.\n+\n+`team-a-client` has a `Dev Team A` role which gives it permissions to do anything on topics that start with 'a_', and only write to topics that start with 'x_'.\n+The topic named `my-topic` matches neither of those.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application, and let's try to write to topic `a_messages`.\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+  --producer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+Second message\n+```\n+\n+Although we can see some unrelated warnings, looking at the Kafka container log there is DEBUG level output saying 'Authorization GRANTED'.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application.\n+\n+You can see the Kafka container log by running:\n+\n+    kubectl logs my-cluster-kafka-0 -f\n+\n+### Consuming the Messages\n+\n+Let's now try to consume the messages we have produced.\n+\n+    bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+      --from-beginning --consumer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+\n+This gives us an error like: `Not authorized to access group: console-consumer-55841`.\n+\n+The reason is that we have to override the default consumer group name -

Because they are refreshed, any changes to the grants on the Keycloak server are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+== Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/examples/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/examples\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for Keycloak\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` (for example, `default`), use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+----\n+\n+\n+== Using the Keycloak Admin Console to configure authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+----\n+\n+Use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as username and password.\n+\n+In the upper left corner under the Keycloak icon you should see `Master` selected as the current realm.\n+Moving the mouse pointer over it should reveal two additional realms - `Demo` and `Kafka-authz`.\n+\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Selecting it will open the `Realm Settings` for the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+From the *Realm Settings* you can navigate to  *Groups*, *Roles*, *Clients* and *Users*.\n+\n+Under *Groups*, you can view groups to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with a name assigned. Typically, they are used to compartmentalize users into geographical, organizational or departmental units, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make a user a member of a group through a custom LDAP server admin user interface, for example, to grant them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under *Users*, when viewing all users you will see two users defined: `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under *Roles*, you can view the realm roles to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to _tag_ users with organizational roles and have the requisite permissions.\n+Roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider. If LDAP is a requirement, you could use groups instead.\n+\n+Under *Clients*, you can view the additional client configurations: `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth 2.0 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth 2.0 client authentication.\n+This client also contains the Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client from the *Authorization* tab, which becomes visible when *Authorization Enabled* is switched on from the *Settings* tab.\n+\n+\n+== Defining Authorization Services for access control\n+\n+Keycloak Authorization Services use authorization scopes, policies and permissions to define and apply access control to resources.\n+\n+Resources define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of authorization scopes - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+Policies define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, permissions tie together the resources, authorization scopes and policies that specify _users U can perform actions A on resource R_.\n+\n+For more information about Keycloak Authorization Services, see {keycloak-authorization-services}, but note that the Authorization Services documentation is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources rather than access to Kafka.\n+\n+When viewing resources from the Keycloak user interface you will see a list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers, patterns in a specific format that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+For example, this pattern targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_':\n+\n+----\n+kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*  \n+---- \n+\n+If a cluster is not specified by name ( `kafka-cluster:cluster-1`), the specifier targets any cluster. For example, this pattern targets any cluster with a name starting  'x_':\n+----\n+Group:x_* \n+----\n+\n+\n+The possible resource types, such as `Topic`, `Group` and `Cluster`, mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model].\n+\n+*Authorization Scopes* lists of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on specific resources.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+The list of actions mirrors Kafka permissions and is the same for any deployment.\n+\n+Rather than importing authorization scopes manually into every new client, you can use a link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file.\n+\n+You must make sure that the client is enabled in Keycloak for Authorization Services. After which, you can import a JSON file from the *Authorization* tab. You can see the loaded scopes from the *Authorization Scopes* page.\n+\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+The *Policies* tab has filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the roles, or groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be defined programmatically using JavaScript so the logic considers the context of the client session, such as the IP of a Kafka client.\n+\n+The *Permissions* tab defines role bindings that associate resources, authorization scopes and policies for applying a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Use a clear, descriptive name for each permission definition so that it is obvious what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+----\n+Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+----\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+== Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties << EOF\n+security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT\n+sasl.mechanism=OAUTHBEARER\n+sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required \\\n+  oauth.client.id=\"team-a-client\" \\\n+  oauth.client.secret=\"team-a-client-secret\" \\\n+  oauth.token.endpoint.uri=\"http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/kafka-authz/protocol/openid-connect/token\" ;\n+sasl.login.callback.handler.class=io.strimzi.kafka.oauth.client.JaasClientOauthLoginCallbackHandler\n+EOF\n+```\n+\n+In the Keycloak Console you can find which roles are assigned to the `team-a-client` service account, by selecting `team-a-client` in the `Clients` section.\n+and then opening the `Service Account Roles` tab for the client.\n+You should see the `Dev Team A` realm role assigned.\n+\n+We can now use this configuration with Kafka's CLI tools.\n+\n+\n+### Producing the Messages\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages to topic 'my-topic':\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic my-topic \\\n+  --producer.config=/tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+```\n+\n+When we press `Enter` to push the first message we receive `Not authorized to access topics: [my-topic]` error.\n+\n+`team-a-client` has a `Dev Team A` role which gives it permissions to do anything on topics that start with 'a_', and only write to topics that start with 'x_'.\n+The topic named `my-topic` matches neither of those.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application, and let's try to write to topic `a_messages`.\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+  --producer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+Second message\n+```\n+\n+Although we can see some unrelated warnings, looking at the Kafka container log there is DEBUG level output saying 'Authorization GRANTED'.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application.\n+\n+You can see the Kafka container log by running:\n+\n+    kubectl logs my-cluster-kafka-0 -f\n+\n+### Consuming the Messages\n+\n+Let's now try to consume the messages we have produced.\n+\n+    bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+      --from-beginning --consumer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+\n+This gives us an error like: `Not authorized to access group: console-consumer-55841`.\n+\n+The reason is that we have to override the default consumer group name -

con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-authorization-services.adoc\n+\n+[id='con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-example_{context}']\n+= Example authorization rules configuration using Authorization Services\n+\n+This is an end-to-end example of using Keycloak Authorization Services to configure authorization rules for use with `keycloak` authorization in Strimzi.\n+The example starts by deploying the Keycloak server with pre-configured realms, requiring no additional configuration.\n+We deploy the Kafka cluster configured to use one of the pre-configured realms.\n+We connect to the Keycloak Admin Console and demonstrate the sections of the user interface where authorizations rules are configured.\n+We use Kafka CLI client tools with different personal and service accounts to demonstrate limited access based on the permissions granted to different accounts.\n+\n+\n+== Token Based Authorization with Keycloak Authorization Services\n+\n+Once the Kafka Broker has obtained an access token by using `oauth` authentication, it is possible to use centrally managed authorization rules to enforce access restrictions onto Kafka Clients.\n+For this, Strimzi Kafka Operator comes with `keycloak` authorization which uses Keycloak Authorization Services to centrally manage permissions.\n+\n+When using `keycloak` authorization a custom authorizer is configured on the Kafka Broker that uses Authorization Services REST endpoints available on Keycloak, which provide a list of granted permissions on resources for authenticated users.\n+The list of grants (permissions) is fetched as the first action after an authenticated session is established by the Kafka client, and then regularly refreshed in the background.\n+Grants are cached and enforced locally on the Kafka Broker for each user session to provide fast authorization decisions. Because they are refreshed, any changes to the grants on the Keycloak server are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+== Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/examples/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/examples\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for Keycloak\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` (for example, `default`), use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+----\n+\n+\n+== Using the Keycloak Admin Console to configure authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+----\n+\n+Use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as username and password.\n+\n+In the upper left corner under the Keycloak icon you should see `Master` selected as the current realm.\n+Moving the mouse pointer over it should reveal two additional realms - `Demo` and `Kafka-authz`.\n+\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Selecting it will open the `Realm Settings` for the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+From the *Realm Settings* you can navigate to  *Groups*, *Roles*, *Clients* and *Users*.\n+\n+Under *Groups*, you can view groups to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with a name assigned. Typically, they are used to compartmentalize users into geographical, organizational or departmental units, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make a user a member of a group through a custom LDAP server admin user interface, for example, to grant them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under *Users*, when viewing all users you will see two users defined: `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under *Roles*, you can view the realm roles to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to _tag_ users with organizational roles and have the requisite permissions.\n+Roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider. If LDAP is a requirement, you could use groups instead.\n+\n+Under *Clients*, you can view the additional client configurations: `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth 2.0 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth 2.0 client authentication.\n+This client also contains the Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client from the *Authorization* tab, which becomes visible when *Authorization Enabled* is switched on from the *Settings* tab.\n+\n+\n+== Defining Authorization Services for access control\n+\n+Keycloak Authorization Services use authorization scopes, policies and permissions to define and apply access control to resources.\n+\n+Resources define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of authorization scopes - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+Policies define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, permissions tie together the resources, authorization scopes and policies that specify _users U can perform actions A on resource R_.\n+\n+For more information about Keycloak Authorization Services, see {keycloak-authorization-services}, but note that the Authorization Services documentation is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources rather than access to Kafka.\n+\n+When viewing resources from the Keycloak user interface you will see a list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers, patterns in a specific format that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+For example, this pattern targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_':\n+\n+----\n+kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*  \n+---- \n+\n+If a cluster is not specified by name ( `kafka-cluster:cluster-1`), the specifier targets any cluster. For example, this pattern targets any cluster with a name starting  'x_':\n+----\n+Group:x_* \n+----\n+\n+\n+The possible resource types, such as `Topic`, `Group` and `Cluster`, mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model].\n+\n+*Authorization Scopes* lists of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on specific resources.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+The list of actions mirrors Kafka permissions and is the same for any deployment.\n+\n+Rather than importing authorization scopes manually into every new client, you can use a link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file.\n+\n+You must make sure that the client is enabled in Keycloak for Authorization Services. After which, you can import a JSON file from the *Authorization* tab. You can see the loaded scopes from the *Authorization Scopes* page.\n+\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+The *Policies* tab has filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the roles, or groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be defined programmatically using JavaScript so the logic considers the context of the client session, such as the IP of a Kafka client.\n+\n+The *Permissions* tab defines role bindings that associate resources, authorization scopes and policies for applying a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Use a clear, descriptive name for each permission definition so that it is obvious what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+----\n+Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+----\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+== Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties << EOF\n+security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT\n+sasl.mechanism=OAUTHBEARER\n+sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required \\\n+  oauth.client.id=\"team-a-client\" \\\n+  oauth.client.secret=\"team-a-client-secret\" \\\n+  oauth.token.endpoint.uri=\"http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/kafka-authz/protocol/openid-connect/token\" ;\n+sasl.login.callback.handler.class=io.strimzi.kafka.oauth.client.JaasClientOauthLoginCallbackHandler\n+EOF\n+```\n+\n+In the Keycloak Console you can find which roles are assigned to the `team-a-client` service account, by selecting `team-a-client` in the `Clients` section.\n+and then opening the `Service Account Roles` tab for the client.\n+You should see the `Dev Team A` realm role assigned.\n+\n+We can now use this configuration with Kafka's CLI tools.\n+\n+\n+### Producing the Messages\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages to topic 'my-topic':\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic my-topic \\\n+  --producer.config=/tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+```\n+\n+When we press `Enter` to push the first message we receive `Not authorized to access topics: [my-topic]` error.\n+\n+`team-a-client` has a `Dev Team A` role which gives it permissions to do anything on topics that start with 'a_', and only write to topics that start with 'x_'.\n+The topic named `my-topic` matches neither of those.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application, and let's try to write to topic `a_messages`.\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+  --producer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+Second message\n+```\n+\n+Although we can see some unrelated warnings, looking at the Kafka container log there is DEBUG level output saying 'Authorization GRANTED'.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application.\n+\n+You can see the Kafka container log by running:\n+\n+    kubectl logs my-cluster-kafka-0 -f\n+\n+### Consuming the Messages\n+\n+Let's now try to consume the messages we have produced.\n+\n+    bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+      --from-beginning --consumer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+\n+This gives us an error like: `Not authorized to access group: console-consumer-55841`.\n+\n+The reason is that we have to override the default consumer group name -

Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, permissions tie together the resources, authorization scopes and policies that specify _users U can perform actions A on resource R_.\n+\n+For more information about Keycloak Authorization Services, see {keycloak-authorization-services}, but note that the Authorization Services documentation is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources rather than access to Kafka.\n+\n+When viewing resources from the Keycloak user interface you will see a list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers, patterns in a specific format that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+For example, this pattern targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_':\n+\n+----\n+kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*  \n+---- \n+\n+If a cluster is not specified by name ( `kafka-cluster:cluster-1`), the specifier targets any cluster. For example, this pattern targets any cluster with a name starting  'x_':\n+----\n+Group:x_* \n+----\n+\n+\n+The possible resource types, such as `Topic`, `Group` and `Cluster`, mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model].\n+\n+*Authorization Scopes* lists of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on specific resources.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+The list of actions mirrors Kafka permissions and is the same for any deployment.\n+\n+Rather than importing authorization scopes manually into every new client, you can use a link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file.\n+\n+You must make sure that the client is enabled in Keycloak for Authorization Services. After which, you can import a JSON file from the *Authorization* tab. You can see the loaded scopes from the *Authorization Scopes* page.\n+\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+The *Policies* tab has filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the roles, or groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be defined programmatically using JavaScript so the logic considers the context of the client session, such as the IP of a Kafka client.\n+\n+The *Permissions* tab defines role bindings that associate resources, authorization scopes and policies for applying a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Use a clear, descriptive name for each permission definition so that it is obvious what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+----\n+Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+----\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+== Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties << EOF\n+security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT\n+sasl.mechanism=OAUTHBEARER\n+sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required \\\n+  oauth.client.id=\"team-a-client\" \\\n+  oauth.client.secret=\"team-a-client-secret\" \\\n+  oauth.token.endpoint.uri=\"http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/kafka-authz/protocol/openid-connect/token\" ;\n+sasl.login.callback.handler.class=io.strimzi.kafka.oauth.client.JaasClientOauthLoginCallbackHandler\n+EOF\n+```\n+\n+In the Keycloak Console you can find which roles are assigned to the `team-a-client` service account, by selecting `team-a-client` in the `Clients` section.\n+and then opening the `Service Account Roles` tab for the client.\n+You should see the `Dev Team A` realm role assigned.\n+\n+We can now use this configuration with Kafka's CLI tools.\n+\n+\n+### Producing the Messages\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages to topic 'my-topic':\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic my-topic \\\n+  --producer.config=/tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+```\n+\n+When we press `Enter` to push the first message we receive `Not authorized to access topics: [my-topic]` error.\n+\n+`team-a-client` has a `Dev Team A` role which gives it permissions to do anything on topics that start with 'a_', and only write to topics that start with 'x_'.\n+The topic named `my-topic` matches neither of those.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application, and let's try to write to topic `a_messages`.\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+  --producer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+Second message\n+```\n+\n+Although we can see some unrelated warnings, looking at the Kafka container log there is DEBUG level output saying 'Authorization GRANTED'.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application.\n+\n+You can see the Kafka container log by running:\n+\n+    kubectl logs my-cluster-kafka-0 -f\n+\n+### Consuming the Messages\n+\n+Let's now try to consume the messages we have produced.\n+\n+    bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+      --from-beginning --consumer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+\n+This gives us an error like: `Not authorized to access group: console-consumer-55841`.\n+\n+The reason is that we have to override the default consumer group name -

Typically, they are used to compartmentalize users into geographical, organizational or departmental units, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make a user a member of a group through a custom LDAP server admin user interface, for example, to grant them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under *Users*, when viewing all users you will see two users defined: `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under *Roles*, you can view the realm roles to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to _tag_ users with organizational roles and have the requisite permissions.\n+Roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider. If LDAP is a requirement, you could use groups instead.\n+\n+Under *Clients*, you can view the additional client configurations: `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth 2.0 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth 2.0 client authentication.\n+This client also contains the Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client from the *Authorization* tab, which becomes visible when *Authorization Enabled* is switched on from the *Settings* tab.\n+\n+\n+== Defining Authorization Services for access control\n+\n+Keycloak Authorization Services use authorization scopes, policies and permissions to define and apply access control to resources.\n+\n+Resources define _what_ we are protecting from unauthorized access.\n+Each resource can contain a list of authorization scopes - actions that are available on the resource, so that permission on a resource can be granted for one or more actions only.\n+Policies define the groups of users we want to target with permissions. Users can be targeted based on group membership, assigned roles, or individually.\n+Finally, permissions tie together the resources, authorization scopes and policies that specify _users U can perform actions A on resource R_.\n+\n+For more information about Keycloak Authorization Services, see {keycloak-authorization-services}, but note that the Authorization Services documentation is focused primarily on using the Authorization Services to protect web resources rather than access to Kafka.\n+\n+When viewing resources from the Keycloak user interface you will see a list of resource definitions.\n+These are resource specifiers, patterns in a specific format that are used to target policies to specific resources.\n+For example, this pattern targets only topics in kafka cluster 'cluster-1' with names starting with 'a_':\n+\n+----\n+kafka-cluster:cluster-1,Topic:a_*  \n+---- \n+\n+If a cluster is not specified by name ( `kafka-cluster:cluster-1`), the specifier targets any cluster. For example, this pattern targets any cluster with a name starting  'x_':\n+----\n+Group:x_* \n+----\n+\n+\n+The possible resource types, such as `Topic`, `Group` and `Cluster`, mirror the xref:kafka_authorization_model[Kafka authorization model].\n+\n+*Authorization Scopes* lists of all the possible actions (Kafka permissions) that can be granted on specific resources.\n+It requires some understanding of link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#resources_in_kafka[Kafka's permissions model] to know which of these make sense with which resource type.\n+The list of actions mirrors Kafka permissions and is the same for any deployment.\n+\n+Rather than importing authorization scopes manually into every new client, you can use a link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master/oauth-keycloak-authorizer/etc/authorization-scopes.json[authorization-scopes.json] file.\n+\n+You must make sure that the client is enabled in Keycloak for Authorization Services. After which, you can import a JSON file from the *Authorization* tab. You can see the loaded scopes from the *Authorization Scopes* page.\n+\n+For this example the authorization scopes have already been imported as part of the realm import.\n+\n+The *Policies* tab has filters that match sets of users.\n+Users can be explicitly listed, or they can be matched based on the roles, or groups they are assigned.\n+Policies can even be defined programmatically using JavaScript so the logic considers the context of the client session, such as the IP of a Kafka client.\n+\n+The *Permissions* tab defines role bindings that associate resources, authorization scopes and policies for applying a set of permissions on specific resources for certain users.\n+\n+Use a clear, descriptive name for each permission definition so that it is obvious what kind of access is granted to which users.\n+For example:\n+\n+----\n+Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+----\n+\n+If we take a closer look at the `Dev Team A can write ...` permission definition, we see that it combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy.\n+If we click on the `Dev Team A` policy, we see that it matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+Similarly, the `Dev Team B ...` permissions perform matching using the `Dev Team B` policy which also uses realm role to match allowed users - in this case those with realm role `Dev Team B`.\n+The `Dev Team B ...` permissions grant users `Describe` and `Read` on `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, effectively giving matching users and clients the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with 'x_'.\n+\n+## Targeting Permissions - Clients and Roles vs. Users and Groups\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with 'service accounts' enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a clientId and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use Group policies, and should instead use Role policies.\n+Or, thinking about it another way, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the Group policies, rather than the Role policies.\n+That's what we see used in `permissions` that start with 'ClusterManager'.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log-in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+== Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+Under `Clients` / `kafka` / `Authorization` / `Settings` make sure the `Decision Strategy` is set to `Affirmative`, and NOT to `Unanimous`.\n+Click on other tabs and make sure there are some resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions defined.\n+\n+With configuration now in place, let's create some topics, use a producer, a consumer, and try to perform some management operations using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, we run a new interactive pod container using a Strimzi Kafka image which we use to connect to the already running Kafka broker.\n+\n+    kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never --image=quay.io/strimzi/kafka:latest-kafka-2.6.0 kafka-cli -- /bin/sh\n+\n+The first time you run this, the `kubectl` might timeout waiting on the image to be downloaded, but your subsequent attempts may result in AlreadyExists error.\n+\n+You can attach to the existing pod by running:\n+\n+    kubectl attach -ti kafka-cli\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages as client `team-a-client`.\n+\n+First, we prepare a Kafka client configuration file with authentication parameters.\n+\n+```\n+cat > /tmp/team-a-client.properties << EOF\n+security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT\n+sasl.mechanism=OAUTHBEARER\n+sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required \\\n+  oauth.client.id=\"team-a-client\" \\\n+  oauth.client.secret=\"team-a-client-secret\" \\\n+  oauth.token.endpoint.uri=\"http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/kafka-authz/protocol/openid-connect/token\" ;\n+sasl.login.callback.handler.class=io.strimzi.kafka.oauth.client.JaasClientOauthLoginCallbackHandler\n+EOF\n+```\n+\n+In the Keycloak Console you can find which roles are assigned to the `team-a-client` service account, by selecting `team-a-client` in the `Clients` section.\n+and then opening the `Service Account Roles` tab for the client.\n+You should see the `Dev Team A` realm role assigned.\n+\n+We can now use this configuration with Kafka's CLI tools.\n+\n+\n+### Producing the Messages\n+\n+Let's try to produce some messages to topic 'my-topic':\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic my-topic \\\n+  --producer.config=/tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+```\n+\n+When we press `Enter` to push the first message we receive `Not authorized to access topics: [my-topic]` error.\n+\n+`team-a-client` has a `Dev Team A` role which gives it permissions to do anything on topics that start with 'a_', and only write to topics that start with 'x_'.\n+The topic named `my-topic` matches neither of those.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application, and let's try to write to topic `a_messages`.\n+\n+```\n+bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+  --producer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+First message\n+Second message\n+```\n+\n+Although we can see some unrelated warnings, looking at the Kafka container log there is DEBUG level output saying 'Authorization GRANTED'.\n+\n+Use CTRL-C to exit the CLI application.\n+\n+You can see the Kafka container log by running:\n+\n+    kubectl logs my-cluster-kafka-0 -f\n+\n+### Consuming the Messages\n+\n+Let's now try to consume the messages we have produced.\n+\n+    bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic a_messages \\\n+      --from-beginning --consumer.config /tmp/team-a-client.properties\n+\n+This gives us an error like: `Not authorized to access group: console-consumer-55841`.\n+\n+The reason is that we have to override the default consumer group name -

Because they are refreshed, any changes to the grants on the Keycloak server are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+== Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/examples/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/examples\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for Keycloak\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` (for example, `default`), use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+----\n+\n+\n+== Using the Keycloak Admin Console to configure authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+----\n+\n+Use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as username and password.\n+\n+The default view usually displays the *Master* realm.\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm, which you can select in the upper left corner.\n+\n+Initially the *Realm Settings* section is selected, but you can navigate to  *Groups*, *Roles*, *Clients* and *Users*.\n+\n+Under *Groups*, you can view groups to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with a name assigned. Typically, they are used to compartmentalize users into geographical, organizational or departmental units, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make a user a member of a group through a custom LDAP server admin user interface, for example, to grant them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under *Users*, when viewing all users you will see two users defined: `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under *Roles*, you can view the realm roles to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to _tag_ users with organizational roles and have the requisite permissions.\n+Roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider. If LDAP is a requirement, you could use groups instead.\n+\n+Under *Clients*, you can view the additional client configurations: `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth 2.0 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth 2.0 client authentication.\n+This client also contains the Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client from the *Authorization* tab, which becomes visible when *Authorization Enabled* is switched on from the *Settings* tab.\n+\n+\n+== Defining Authorization Services for access control\n+\n+Keycloak Authorization Services use authorization scopes, policies and permissions to define and apply access control to resources as explained in xref:keycloak_authorization_services_model_for_managing_permissions(one of the previous chapters).\n+\n+Under *Authorization* / *Permissions* of `kafka` client you can see already granted permissions that make use of *Resources* and *Policies* defined under the other tabs:\n+----\n+Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+----\n+\n+`Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster` combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy. The `Dev Team A` policy matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+`Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster` combines `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, scopes `Describe` and `Read`, and `Dev Team B` policy. The `Dev Team A` policy matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team B`. Matching users and clients have the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with `x_`.\n+\n+== Targeting permissions using group or role policies\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with service accounts enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a client ID and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use group policies, and should instead use role policies.\n+Conversely, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the group policies, rather than the role policies.\n+That is what is used for permissions that start with `ClusterManager`.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case, the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+== Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+From menu:Clients[kafka>Authorization>Settings] make sure that *Decision Strategy* is set to *Affirmative*, and NOT to *Unanimous*.\n+Navigate in Keycloak to check that the expected resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions are defined.\n+\n+With the configuration in place, we can check access to Kafka by using a producer and consumer to create topics using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, a new interactive pod container is run using a Strimzi Kafka image to connect to a running Kafka broker.\n+\n+[source,shell]\n+----\n+kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never

Because they are refreshed, any changes to the grants on the Keycloak server are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+== Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/examples/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/examples\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for Keycloak\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+----\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` (for example, `default`), use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+----\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+----\n+\n+\n+== Using the Keycloak Admin Console to configure authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+[source,yaml]\n+----\n+kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+----\n+\n+Use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as username and password.\n+\n+The default view usually displays the *Master* realm.\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm, which you can select in the upper left corner.\n+\n+Initially the *Realm Settings* section is selected, but you can navigate to  *Groups*, *Roles*, *Clients* and *Users*.\n+\n+Under *Groups*, you can view groups to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with a name assigned. Typically, they are used to compartmentalize users into geographical, organizational or departmental units, and so on.\n+\n+In Keycloak the groups can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+That makes it possible to make a user a member of a group through a custom LDAP server admin user interface, for example, to grant them some permissions on Kafka resources.\n+\n+Under *Users*, when viewing all users you will see two users defined: `alice` and `bob`. `alice` is a member of the `ClusterManager Group`, and `bob` is a member of `ClusterManager-my-cluster Group`.\n+In Keycloak the users can be stored in an LDAP identity provider.\n+\n+Under *Roles*, you can view the realm roles to mark users or clients as having some permissions.\n+Roles are a concept analogous to groups. They are usually used to _tag_ users with organizational roles and have the requisite permissions.\n+Roles cannot be stored in an LDAP identity provider. If LDAP is a requirement, you could use groups instead.\n+\n+Under *Clients*, you can view the additional client configurations: `kafka`, `kafka-cli`, `team-a-client`, `team-b-client`.\n+The client with client id `kafka` is used by Kafka Brokers to perform the necessary OAuth 2.0 communication for access token validation,\n+and to authenticate to other Kafka Broker instances using OAuth 2.0 client authentication.\n+This client also contains the Authorization Services resource definitions, policies and authorization scopes used to perform authorization on the Kafka Brokers.\n+\n+The client with client id `kafka-cli` is a public client that can be used by the Kafka command line tools when authenticating with username and password to obtain an access token or a refresh token.\n+\n+Clients `team-a-client`, and `team-b-client` are confidential clients representing services with partial access to certain Kafka topics.\n+\n+The authorization configuration is defined in the `kafka` client from the *Authorization* tab, which becomes visible when *Authorization Enabled* is switched on from the *Settings* tab.\n+\n+\n+== Defining Authorization Services for access control\n+\n+Keycloak Authorization Services use authorization scopes, policies and permissions to define and apply access control to resources as explained in xref:keycloak_authorization_services_model_for_managing_permissions(one of the previous chapters).\n+\n+Under *Authorization* / *Permissions* of `kafka` client you can see already granted permissions that make use of *Resources* and *Policies* defined under the other tabs:\n+----\n+Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster\n+Dev Team B can update consumer group offsets that start with x_ on any cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to cluster config on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to consumer groups on my-cluster\n+ClusterManager of my-cluster Group has full access to topics on my-cluster\n+----\n+\n+`Dev Team A can write to topics that start with x_ on any cluster` combines a resource called `Topic:x_*`, scopes `Describe` and `Write`, and `Dev Team A` policy. The `Dev Team A` policy matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team A`.\n+\n+`Dev Team B can read from topics that start with x_ on any cluster` combines `Topic:x_*`, and `Group:x_*` resources, scopes `Describe` and `Read`, and `Dev Team B` policy. The `Dev Team A` policy matches all users that have a realm role called `Dev Team B`. Matching users and clients have the ability to read from topics, and update the consumed offsets for topics and consumer groups that have names starting with `x_`.\n+\n+== Targeting permissions using group or role policies\n+\n+In Keycloak, confidential clients with service accounts enabled can authenticate to the server in their own name using a client ID and a secret.\n+This is convenient for microservices which typically act in their own name, and not as agents of a particular user (like a web site would, for example).\n+Service accounts can have roles assigned like regular users.\n+They cannot, however, have groups assigned.\n+As a consequence, if you want to target permissions to microservices using service accounts, you cannot use group policies, and should instead use role policies.\n+Conversely, if you want to limit certain permissions only to regular user accounts where authentication with username and password is required, you can achieve that as a side effect of using the group policies, rather than the role policies.\n+That is what is used for permissions that start with `ClusterManager`.\n+Performing cluster management is usually done interactively - in person - using CLI tools.\n+It makes sense to require the user to log in, before using the resulting access token to authenticate to the Kafka Broker.\n+In this case, the access token represents the specific user, rather than the client application.\n+\n+\n+== Authorization in Action Using CLI Clients\n+\n+A note of caution - this example uses the latest version of Keycloak, and relies on bugfixes of issues in some older versions.\n+Let's make sure the Authorization rules have been properly imported when the Keycloak was started.\n+\n+From menu:Clients[kafka>Authorization>Settings] make sure that *Decision Strategy* is set to *Affirmative*, and NOT to *Unanimous*.\n+Navigate in Keycloak to check that the expected resources, authorization claims, policies and permissions are defined.\n+\n+With the configuration in place, we can check access to Kafka by using a producer and consumer to create topics using different user and service accounts.\n+\n+First, a new interactive pod container is run using a Strimzi Kafka image to connect to a running Kafka broker.\n+\n+[source,shell]\n+----\n+kubectl run -ti --rm --restart=Never

use pattern names to be used with pattern matching against the targeted resources when performing the permission check.\n+\n+The general pattern is as follows: `RESOURCE_TYPE:NAME_PATTERN`\n+\n+The resource types mirror the Kafka authorization model.\n+The pattern allows for the two matching options: exact matching (when the pattern does not end with `\\*`), and prefix matching (when the pattern ends with `*`).\n+\n+A few examples:\n+\n+    Topic:my-topic\n+    Topic:orders-*\n+    Group:orders-*\n+    Cluster:*\n+\n+In addition, the general pattern can be prefixed by another one of the format `kafka-cluster:CLUSTER_NAME`, followed by comma, where the cluster name refers to the `metadata.name` in the Kafka CR.\n+\n+For example:\n+\n+    kafka-cluster:my-cluster,Topic:*\n+    kafka-cluster:*,Group:b_*\n+\n+When the `kafka-cluster` prefix is not present it is assumed to be `kafka-cluster:*`.\n+\n+When the resource is defined, a list of possible authorization scopes relevant to the resource should be added to the list of scopes.\n+Set whatever actions make sense for the targeted resource type.\n+\n+While you may add any `authorization scope` to any `resource`, only the

accounts, it can refer to the realm roles or client roles, it can refer to user groups, and it can even use a JS rule and match client's IP address for example.\n+\n+Each policy can be given a name,

of resource definitions that are used to match permitted actions.\n+For example, a resource can be an individual topic, or it can be a set of all topics with names that start with some prefix.\n+The resource definition has a set of available `authorization scopes` associated with it. These represent a set of all actions that can be permitted.\n+Often, only a subset of these actions is actually permitted.\n+\n+`Authorization scopes` is simply a set of all available actions on all the different resource types. When defining a new `resource` the `scopes` added there are taken from this set of all scopes.\n+\n+`Policies` are rules that can use various criteria to match a list of accounts. They can match service accounts based on clientId, they can match user accounts based on username, or group, or roles.\n+\n+Finally, `Permissions` are used to grant a subset of `authorization scopes` on the specific `resource` definition to a set of users.\n+\n+== Mapping Keycloak Authorization Services to Kafka Model\n+\n+In order to grant Kafka permissions to users or service accounts you have to use the Keycloak Authorization Services rules on the OAuth client that represents the Kafka Broker - typically this client has `kafka` as its clientId.\n+\n+This client needs to have `Authorization Enabled` option activated.\n+\n+All the permissions exist within the scope of this OAuth client, which means that if you have different Kafka clusters configured with different OAuth client ids they would each have a separate set of permissions even though they are part of the same realm.\n+\n+When the Kafka client authenticates using `SASL_OAUTHBEARER` the `KeycloakRBACAuthorizer` retrieves the list of grants for the current session from the Keycloak server using the access token of the current session.\n+This list of grants is the result of evaluating the Keycloak Authorization Services policies and permissions.\n+\n+.Authorization scopes\n+\n+Typically the initial configuration involves uploading the authorization scopes which creates a list of all the possible actions that can be performed on all the Kafka resource types.\n+This step is performed only once, before defining any permissions. Alternatively, the authorization scopes can be added manually, but make sure to not introduce typos.\n+\n+The `authorization scopes` should simply contain all the possible Kafka permissions regardless

Services Model\n+\n+There are four concepts used in Keycloak Authorization Services to grant permissions: `resources`, `authorization scopes`, `policies`, and `permissions`.\n+\n+`Resources` are a set of resource definitions that are used to match permitted actions.\n+For example, a resource can be an individual topic, or it can be a set of all topics with names that start with some prefix.\n+The resource definition has a set of available `authorization scopes` associated with it. These represent a set of all actions that can be permitted.\n+Often, only a subset of these actions is actually permitted.\n+\n+`Authorization scopes` is simply a set of all available actions on all the different resource types. When defining a new `resource` the `scopes` added there are taken from this set of all scopes.\n+\n+`Policies` are rules that can use various criteria to match a list of accounts. They can match service accounts based on clientId, they can match user accounts based on username, or group, or roles.\n+\n+Finally, `Permissions` are used to grant a subset of `authorization scopes` on the specific `resource` definition to a set of users.\n+\n+== Mapping Keycloak Authorization Services to Kafka Model\n+\n+In order to grant Kafka permissions to users or service accounts you have to use the Keycloak Authorization Services rules on the OAuth client that represents the Kafka Broker - typically this client has `kafka` as its clientId.\n+\n+This client needs to have `Authorization Enabled` option activated.\n+\n+All the permissions exist within the scope of this OAuth client, which means that if you have different Kafka clusters configured with different OAuth client ids they would each have a separate set of permissions even though they are part of the same realm.\n+\n+When the Kafka client authenticates using `SASL_OAUTHBEARER` the `KeycloakRBACAuthorizer` retrieves the list of grants for the current session from the Keycloak server using the access token of the current session.\n+This list of grants is the result of evaluating the Keycloak Authorization Services policies and permissions.\n+\n+.Authorization scopes\n+\n+Typically the initial configuration involves uploading the authorization scopes which creates a list of all the possible actions that can be performed on all the Kafka resource types.\n+This step is performed only once, before defining any permissions. Alternatively, the authorization scopes can be added manually, but make sure to not introduce typos.\n+\n+The `authorization scopes` should simply contain all the possible Kafka permissions regardless of the resource type:\n+\n+* Create\n+* Write\n+* Read\n+* Delete\n+* Describe\n+* Alter\n+* DescribeConfig\n+* AlterConfig\n+* ClusterAction\n+* IdempotentWrite\n+\n+.Resources\n+\n+The `resources` use pattern names to be used with pattern matching against the targeted resources when performing the permission check.\n+\n+The general pattern is as follows: `RESOURCE_TYPE:NAME_PATTERN`\n+\n+The resource types mirror the Kafka authorization model.\n+The pattern allows for the two matching options: exact matching (when the pattern does not end with `\\*`), and prefix matching (when the pattern

and `permissions`.\n+\n+`Resources` are a set of resource definitions that are used to match permitted actions.\n+For example, a resource can be an individual topic, or it can be a set of all topics with names that start with some prefix.\n+The resource definition has a set of available `authorization scopes` associated with it. These represent a set of all actions that can be permitted.\n+Often, only a subset of these actions is actually permitted.\n+\n+`Authorization scopes` is simply a set of all available actions on all the different resource types. When defining a new `resource` the `scopes` added there are taken from this set of all scopes.\n+\n+`Policies` are rules that can use various criteria to match a list of accounts. They can match service accounts based on clientId, they can match user accounts based on username, or group, or roles.\n+\n+Finally, `Permissions` are used to grant a subset of `authorization scopes` on the specific `resource` definition to a set of users.\n+\n+== Mapping Keycloak Authorization Services to Kafka Model\n+\n+In order to grant Kafka permissions to users or service accounts you have to use the Keycloak Authorization Services rules on the OAuth client that represents the Kafka Broker - typically this client has `kafka` as its clientId.\n+\n+This client needs to have `Authorization Enabled` option activated.\n+\n+All the permissions exist within the scope of this OAuth client, which means that if you have different Kafka clusters configured with different OAuth client ids they would each have a separate set of permissions even though they are part of the same realm.\n+\n+When the Kafka client authenticates using `SASL_OAUTHBEARER` the `KeycloakRBACAuthorizer` retrieves the list of grants for the current session from the Keycloak server using the access token of the current session.\n+This list of grants is the result of evaluating the Keycloak Authorization Services policies and permissions.\n+\n+.Authorization scopes\n+\n+Typically the initial configuration involves uploading the authorization scopes which creates a list of all the possible actions that can be performed on all the Kafka resource types.\n+This step is performed only once, before defining any permissions.

the resource type.\n+\n+Kafka has five resource types for controlling access: `Topic`, `Group`, `Cluster`, `TransactionalId`, `DelegationToken`.\n+\n+Each resource type has different permissions:\n+\n+Topic:\n+\n+* `Create`\n+* `Write`\n+* `Read`\n+* `Delete`\n+* `Describe`\n+* `DescribeConfigs`\n+* `Alter`\n+* `AlterConfigs`\n+\n+Group:\n+\n+* `Read`\n+* `Describe`\n+* `Delete`\n+\n+Cluster:\n+\n+*  `Create`\n+*  `Describe`\n+*  `Alter`\n+*  `DescribeConfigs`\n+*  `AlterConfigs`\n+*  `IdempotentWrite`\n+*  `ClusterAction`\n+\n+TransactionalId:\n+\n+*  `Describe`\n+*  `Write`\n+\n+DelegationToken:\n+\n+* `Describe`\n+\n+== Keycloak Authorization Services model for managing permissions\n+\n+Keycloak Authorization Services use four concepts to define and grant permissions: _resources_, _authorization scopes_, _policies_, and _permissions_.\n+\n+Resources:: Resources are a set of resource definitions that are used to match permitted actions.\n+For example, a resource can be an individual topic, or it can be a set of all topics with names that start with the same prefix.\n+The resource definition has a set of available authorization scopes associated with it, which represent a set of all actions available on the particular resource.\n+Often, only a subset of these actions is actually permitted.\n+\n+Authorization scopes:: Authorization scopes is simply a set of all available actions on all the different resource types. When defining a new resource,  scopes are added from the set of all scopes.\n+\n+Policies:: Policies are rules that use criteria to match a list of accounts. Policies can match service accounts based on client id or roles, or user accounts based on username, groups, or roles.\n+\n+Permissions:: Permissions grant a subset of authorization scopes on a specific resource definition to a set of users.\n+\n+== Mapping Keycloak Authorization Services to Kafka Model\n+\n+Use Keycloak Authorization Services rules on the OAuth client that represents the Kafka Broker to grant Kafka permissions to users or service accounts. Typically, the OAuth client has `kafka` as its client id.\n+\n+The OAuth 2.0 client definition must have the _Authorization Enabled_ option activated.\n+\n+All permissions exist within the scope of this OAuth 2.0 client, which means that if you have different Kafka clusters configured with different OAuth 2.0 client IDs they would each have a separate set of permissions even though they are part of the same realm.\n+\n+When the Kafka client use the _SASL OAUTHBEARER_ mechanism, the Keycloak authorizer (`KeycloakRBACAuthorizer`) retrieves the list of grants for the current session from the Keycloak server using the access token of the current session.\n+This list of grants is the result of evaluating the Keycloak Authorization Services policies and permissions.\n+\n+.Introducing authorization scopes\n+\n+Typically, an initial configuration involves uploading the authorization scopes to create a list of all the possible actions that can be performed on all the Kafka resource types.\n+This step is performed only once, before defining any permissions. Alternatively, you can add authorization scopes manually.\n+\n+The authorization scopes should contain all the possible Kafka permissions regardless of the resource type:\n+\n+* `Create`\n+* `Write`\n+* `Read`\n+* `Delete`\n+* `Describe`\n+* `Alter`\n+* `DescribeConfig`\n+* `AlterConfig`\n+* `ClusterAction`\n+* `IdempotentWrite`\n+\n+.Defining resource patterns for permission checks\n+\n+The resources use pattern names for pattern matching against the targeted resources when performing permission checks.\n+\n+The general pattern is as follows: `RESOURCE_TYPE:NAME_PATTERN`\n+\n+The resource types mirror the Kafka authorization model.\n+The pattern allows for the two matching options: exact matching (when the pattern does not end with `\\*`), and prefix matching (when the pattern ends with `*`).\n+\n+.Example patterns for resources\n+    Topic:my-topic\n+    Topic:orders-*\n+    Group:orders-*\n+    Cluster:*\n+\n+In addition, the general pattern can be prefixed by `kafka-cluster:CLUSTER_NAME` followed by a comma, where the cluster name refers to the `metadata.name` in the Kafka custom resource.\n+\n+.Example patterns for resources with cluster prefix\n+    kafka-cluster:my-cluster,Topic:*\n+    kafka-cluster:*,Group:b_*\n+\n+When the `kafka-cluster` prefix is not present it is assumed to be `kafka-cluster:*`.\n+\n+When defining a resource, you can associate a list of possible authorization scopes relevant to the resource.\n+Set whatever actions make sense for the targeted resource type.\n+\n+While you may add any authorization scope to any resource, only the scopes supported by the resource type are considered for access control.\n+\n+.Policies\n+\n+Policies are used to target permissions to one or more accounts.\n+Targeting can refer to:\n+* Specific user or service accounts\n+* Realm roles or client roles\n+* User groups\n+* JS rule to match a client IP address\n+\n+A policy is given a unique name, and can be reused to target multiple permissions to multiple resources.\n+\n+.Defining permissions based on scopes, resources and policies \n+\n+Use fine-grained permissions to pull together the policies, resources, and authorization scopes that grant access to users.\n+\n+\n+The name of the each permission should should clearly define what permissions it grants to which users.\n+\n+For more information on how to configure permissions through Keycloak Authorization Services, see xref:con-oauth-authorization-keycloak-example_str[the authorization example].\n+\n+\n+== Permissions required

configured on the Kafka Broker to take advantage of Authorization Services REST endpoints available on Keycloak, which provide a list of granted permissions on resources for authenticated users.\n+The list of grants (permissions) is first fetched during the first action after authenticated session is established by Kafka client, and then regularly refreshed in the background.\n+Grants are cached, and enforced locally on the Kafka Broker for each user session in order to provide fast authorization decisions. Because they are refreshed, any changes at Keycloak side are detected and enforced.\n+\n+\n+## Starting Up the Pods\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/master/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+For this example we're using the kubernetes deployment scripts available at https://github.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/tree/examples/examples/kubernetes\n+\n+NOTE: TODO: Change the url to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/master\n+\n+    export ROOT=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstruk/strimzi-kafka-oauth/examples\n+\n+.Deploy the Postgres database for the Keycloak\n+\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres-pvc.yaml\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/postgres.yaml\n+\n+.Deploy the Keycloak server\n+\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-realms-configmap.yaml\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml\n+\n+If your default namespace is not `myproject` but something else (for example, `default`), then use the following to deploy Keycloak:\n+\n+    curl -s $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/keycloak-postgres.yaml | sed -e \"s#myproject#default#\" | kubectl apply -f -\n+\n+.Deploy the minimal Kafka cluster\n+\n+Here we assume that the Strimzi Cluster Operator has already been installed on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+    kubectl apply -f $ROOT/examples/kubernetes/kafka-oauth-single-authz.yaml\n+\n+\n+## Using the Keycloak Admin Console to Configure Authorization\n+\n+You can login to the Keycloak Admin Console by creating a tunnel to the keycloak pod:\n+\n+    kubectl port-forward keycloak 8080\n+\n+Now use your browser to connect to `http://localhost:8080/auth/admin` and use `admin` as both a username, and a password.\n+\n+In the upper left corner under the Keycloak icon you should see `Master` selected as the current realm.\n+Moving the mouse pointer over it should reveal two additional realms - `Demo` and `Kafka-authz`.\n+\n+For this example we are interested in the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Selecting it will open the `Realm Settings` for the `kafka-authz` realm.\n+Next to the `Realm Settings` there are other sections we are interested in - `Groups`, `Roles`, `Clients` and `Users`.\n+\n+Under `Groups` we can see several groups that can be used to mark users as having some permissions.\n+Groups are sets of users with name assigned.
