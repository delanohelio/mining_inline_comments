Using you Java IDE you can connect to a remote process over a TCP connection, and perform debugging actions like setting breakpoints, suspending threads, gathering stack and heap info, and evaluating arbitrary java code inside the running JVM.\n+\n+In order to activate remote debugging the java process needs to be run with an additional argument like the following:\n+\n+    -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5005\n+\n+This starts a TCP server on localhost using the specified port (5005 in this case). Connection is only possible from the localhost.\n+Because we used `suspend=y` the start up of the JVM will stall, and wait for the debug client to connect.\n+All the popular Java IDEs support remote debugging.\n+\n+\n+## Remote debugging the Strimzi Cluster Operator\n+\n+Strimzi Cluster Operator is installed through Deployment definition in `install/cluster-operator/060-Deployment-strimzi-cluster-operator.yaml`.\n+\n+We can enable remote debugging by adding the `JAVA_OPTS` environment variable to `strimzi-cluster-operator` container in this file:\n+\n+          env:\n+            ...\n+            - name: JAVA_OPTS\n+              value: \"-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5005\"\n+\n+\n+Let's also increase the livenessProbe timeout:\n+\n+          livenessProbe:\n+            initialDelaySeconds: 3600\n+            timeoutSeconds: 3600\n+\n+Apply the modified file:\n+\n+    kubectl apply -f install/cluster-operator/060-Deployment-strimzi-cluster-operator.yaml\n+\n+We also need to open the port for localhost access:\n+\n+    kubectl port-forward $(oc get pod | grep strimzi-cluster-operator | awk '{printf $1}') 5006:5005\n+\n+Start tailing the operator pod:\n+\n+    oc logs $(oc get pod | grep strimzi-cluster-operator | awk '{printf $1}') -f \n+\n+You can now start the remote debug session from your IDE.\n+\n+\n+## Remote debugging the Kafka Broker\n+\n+Kafka Broker pods are defined through 'my-cluster-kafka' StatefulSet which is created by Strimzi Kafka Operator.\n+\n+In order to activate the remote debugging we need to get the Kafka Broker to run with remote debugging agent activated.\n+\n+This can be achieved by adding the following to your Kafka CR cluster definition:\n+\n+```\n+\n+spec:\n+  kafka:\n+    ...\n+\n+    livenessProbe:\n+      initialDelaySeconds: 3600\n+      timeoutSeconds: 3600\n+    template:\n+      kafkaContainer:\n+        env:\n+        - name: KAFKA_DEBUG\n+          value: \"y\"\n+        - name: DEBUG_SUSPEND_FLAG\n+          value: \"y\"\n+        - name: JAVA_DEBUG_PORT\n+          value: \"5005\"\n+\n+```\n+\n+We also need to open the specified port (5005 in this case) to be reachable from your host machine:\n+\n+    kubectl port-forward my-cluster-kafka-0 5005\n+\n+If you want to map to a different local port use the LOCAL:REMOTE format, for example:\n+\n+    kubectl port-forward my-cluster-kafka-0 8787:5005\n+\n+All you now have to do is deploy the new Kafka cluster definition, configure remote debugging in your favourite IDE, telling it to connect to localhost:5005, and start your debug session.\n+\n+With `DEBUG_SUSPEND_FLAG` set to 'y', the Kafka Broker process will wait during startup for remote degugger (IDE) to connect before continuing with JVM start up.\n+\n+In Kafka CR we have adjusted the probes to prevent Kubernetes from killing the broker whose execution is suspended due to a breakpoint.\n+\n+Before remotely connecting with IDE you'll want to start tailing the `my-cluster-kafka-0` broker pod:\n+\n+    kubectl logs my-cluster-kafka-0 -f\n+\n+You should see the following as the last line:\n+\n+    Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 5005\n+\n+You can now start a remote debug session from your IDE.\n+\n+Note: Apache Kafka is written in a way that it detects stalled request processing threads and may exit the JVM that appears to have stalled.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4NTQ2OTAyNg=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "9dd446e50319cd6102a42fc1b347d260cbab8678"}, "originalPosition": 116}]}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 1097, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-13T12:26:42Z"}}}
