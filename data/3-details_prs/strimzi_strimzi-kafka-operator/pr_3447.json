change\nDocumentation\nNew Managing secure access to Kafka chapter\nDescribes config for Kafka and clients, plus external listeners and OAuth\n\nNew doc assemblies for chapter\nMoved broker, listener, acl, user config to appendix\nConsolidated Kafka security steps\nFixed links for for guides to reflect new structure\nNew images for Kafka authentication and authorization\nCreated new concepts for listener configuration\nCreated placeholder images for Kafka authentication and authorization options\nMinimized content, deleted 24 files\n\nMight be that we want to create a Securing Strimzi guide eventually, which also incorporates the Security chapter that deals with certificates.\nCommits for the PR are split by changes to the appendix and the new chapter.\n\nChecklist\nPlease go through this checklist and make sure all applicable tasks have been done\n\n Write tests\n Make sure all tests pass\n Update documentation\n Check RBAC rights for Kubernetes / OpenShift roles\n Try your changes from Pod inside your Kubernetes and OpenShift cluster, not just locally\n Reference relevant issue(s) and close them after merging\n Update CHANGELOG.md\n Supply screenshots for visual
