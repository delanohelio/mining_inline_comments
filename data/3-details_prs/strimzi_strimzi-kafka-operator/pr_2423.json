The current docs are correct but I found them confusing unless you really focus on what they say. In one paragraph they state that restarting failed tasks is supported and in the next they say that the KafkaConnector resource doesn't support restarting failed tasks. When you understand the underlying structure and the APIs present this makes sense. However, if you are simply a user I think it is a bit hard to understand especially for new users.\nI think that this PR improves things by combining the to mentions. However, it's only a suggestion and am happy to be guided by @laidan6000 and @PaulRMellor", "createdAt": "2020-01-18T11:03:32Z", "url": "https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/pull/2423",
