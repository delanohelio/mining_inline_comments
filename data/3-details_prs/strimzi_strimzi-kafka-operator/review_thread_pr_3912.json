_auto-commit mechanism_ allows a consumer to commit the offsets of messages automatically.\n+If enabled, the consumer will commit offsets received from polling the broker at 5000ms intervals.\n+\n+The auto-commit mechanism is convenient, but it introduces a risk of data loss and duplication.\n+If a consumer has fetched and transformed a number of messages, but the system crashes with processed messages in the consumer buffer when performing an auto-commit, that data is lost.\n+If the system crashes after processing the messages, but before performing the auto-commit, the data is duplicated on another consumer instance after rebalancing.\n+\n+To minimize the likelihood of data loss or duplication, set `enable.auto.commit` to `false` and develop your client application to have more control over committing offsets.\n+Or use `auto.commit.interval.ms=1` to decrease the intervals between commits.\n+\n+By setting to `enable.auto.commit` to `false`, you can commit offsets after *all* processing has been performed and the message has been consumed.\n+For example, you can set up your application to call the Kafka `commitSync` and `commitAsync` commit APIs.\n+\n+The `commitSync` API commits the offsets in a message batch returned from polling.\n+You call the API when you are finished processing all the messages in the batch.\n+If you use the `commitSync` API, the application will not poll for new messages until the last offset in the batch is committed.\n+If this impacts throughput unduly, you can commit less frequently,\n+or you can use the `commitAsync` API.\n+The `commitAsync` API does not wait for the broker to respond to a commit request,\n+but risks creating more duplicates when rebalancing.\n+A common approach is to combine both commit APIs in an application, with the `commitSync` API used just before shutting the consumer down or rebalancing to make sure the final commit is successful.\n+\n+Also, consider using transactional ids and having idempotence enabled (`enable.idempotence=true`) on the producer side to guarantee exactly once delivery.\n+On the consumer side, you can then use the `isolation.level` property to control how transactional messages are read by the consumer.\n+\n+The `isolation.level` property has two valid values:\n+\n+* `read_committed`\n+* `read_uncommitted`", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null,

low.\n+\n+For example, if you set `fetch.max.wait.ms` to 500ms and `fetch.min.bytes` to 16384 bytes,\n+when Kafka receives a fetch request from the consumer it will respond when the first of either threshold is reached.\n+\n+Conversely, you can adjust the `fetch.max.wait.ms` and `fetch.min.bytes` properties lower to improve end-to-end latency.\n+\n+----\n+# ...\n+fetch.max.wait.ms=500 <1>\n+fetch.min.bytes=16384 <2>\n+# ...\n+----\n+<1> The maximum time in milliseconds the broker will wait before completing fetch requests.\n+The default is `500` milliseconds.\n+<2> If a minimum batch size in bytes is used, a request is sent when the minimum is reached, or messages have been queued for longer than `fetch.max.wait.ms` (whichever comes sooner).\n+Adding the delay allows batches to accumulate messages up to the batch size.\n+\n+.Lowering latency by increasing the fetch request size\n+\n+Use the `fetch.max.bytes` and `max.partition.fetch.bytes` properties to increase the maximum amount of data fetched by the consumer from the Kafka broker.\n+\n+The `fetch.max.bytes` property sets a maximum limit in bytes on the amount of data fetched from the broker at one time,\n+\n+The `max.partition.fetch.bytes` sets a maximum limit in bytes on how much data is returned for each partition,\n+which must always be larger than the number of bytes set in the broker or topic configuration for `max.message.bytes`.\n+\n+The maximum amount of memory a client can consume is approximately:\n+\n+[source,shell,subs=\"+quotes,attributes\"]\n+----\n+_NUMBER-OF-BROKERS_ * fetch.max.bytes and _NUMBER-OF-PARTITIONS_ * max.partition.fetch.bytes\n+----\n+\n+If memory usage can accommodate it, you can increase the values of these two properties.\n+By allowing more data in each request, latency is improved as there are fewer fetch requests.\n+\n+----\n+# ...\n+fetch.max.bytes=52428800 <1>\n+max.partition.fetch.bytes=1048576 <2>\n+# ...\n+----\n+<1> The maximum amount of data in bytes returned for a fetch request.\n+<2> The maximum amount of data in bytes returned for each partition.\n+\n+== Avoiding data loss or duplication when committing offsets\n+\n+The Kafka _auto-commit mechanism_ allows a consumer to commit the offsets of messages automatically.\n+If enabled, the consumer will commit offsets received from polling the broker at 5000ms intervals.\n+\n+The auto-commit mechanism is convenient, but it introduces a risk of data loss and duplication.\n+If a consumer has fetched and transformed a number of messages, but the system crashes with processed messages in the consumer buffer when performing an auto-commit, that data is lost.\n+If the system crashes after processing the messages, but before performing the auto-commit, the data is duplicated on another consumer instance after rebalancing.\n+\n+To minimize the likelihood of data loss or duplication, set `enable.auto.commit` to `false` and develop your client application to have more control over committing offsets.\n+Or use `auto.commit.interval.ms=1` to decrease the intervals between commits.\n+\n+By setting to `enable.auto.commit` to `false`, you can commit offsets after *all* processing has been performed and the message has been consumed.\n+For example, you can set up your application to call the Kafka `commitSync` and `commitAsync` commit APIs.\n+\n+The `commitSync` API commits the offsets in a message batch returned from polling.\n+You call the API when you are finished processing all the messages in the batch.\n+If you use the `commitSync` API, the application will not poll for new messages until the last offset in the batch is committed.\n+If this impacts throughput unduly, you can commit less frequently,\n+or you can use the `commitAsync` API.\n+The `commitAsync` API does not wait for the broker to respond to a commit request,\n+but risks creating more duplicates when rebalancing.\n+A common approach is to combine both commit APIs in an application, with the `commitSync` API used just before shutting the consumer down or rebalancing to make sure the final commit is successful.\n+\n+Also, consider using transactional ids and having idempotence enabled (`enable.idempotence=true`) on the producer side to guarantee exactly once delivery.\n+On the consumer side, you can then use the `isolation.level` property to control how transactional messages are read by the consumer.\n+\n+The `isolation.level` property has two valid values:\n+\n+* `read_committed`\n+* `read_uncommitted`\n+\n+Use `read_committed` to ensure that only transactional messages that have been committed are read by the consumer.\n+However, this will cause an increase in end-to-end latency, because the consumer won\u2019t be able to return a message until the brokers have written the transaction markers that record the result of the transaction (_committed_ or _aborted_).\n+\n+----\n+# ...\n+enable.auto.commit=false <1>\n+isolation.level=read_committed <2>\n+# ...\n+----\n+<1> Auto commit is set to false to provide more control over committing offsets\n+<2> Set to `read_committed` so that only committed messages are read by the consumer.\n+\n+== Recovering from failure to avoid data loss\n+\n+Use the `session.timeout.ms` and `heatbeat.interval.ms` properties to configure the time taken to check and recover from consumer failure within a consumer group.\n+\n+The `session.timeout.ms` property specifies the maximum amount of time in milliseconds a consumer within a consumer group can be out of contact with a broker before being considered inactive and a _rebalancing_ is triggered between the active consumers in the group.\n+When the group rebalances, the partitions are reassigned to the members of the group.\n+\n+The `heatbeat.interval.ms` property specifies the interval in milliseconds between _heartbeat_ checks to the consumer group coordinator to indicate that the consumer is active and connected.\n+The heartbeat interval must be lower, usually by a third, than the session timeout interval.\n+\n+If you set the `session.timeout.ms` property lower, failing consumers are detected earlier, and rebalancing can take place quicker.\n+However, take care not to set the timeout so low that the broker fails to receive a heartbeat in time and triggers an unnecessary rebalance.\n+\n+Decreasing the heartbeat interval reduces the chance of accidental rebalancing, but more frequent heartbeats increases the overhead on broker resources.\n+\n+== Handling uncommitted offsets\n+\n+Use the `auto.offset.reset` property to control how the consumer behaves when offsets are not committed.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id":

a broker before being considered inactive and a _rebalancing_ is triggered between the active consumers in the group.\n+When the group rebalances, the partitions are reassigned to the members of the group.\n+\n+The `heatbeat.interval.ms` property specifies the interval in milliseconds between _heartbeat_ checks to the consumer group coordinator to indicate that the consumer is active and connected.\n+The heartbeat interval must be lower, usually by a third, than the session timeout interval.\n+\n+If you set the `session.timeout.ms` property lower, failing consumers are detected earlier, and rebalancing can take place quicker.\n+However, take care not to set the timeout so low that the broker fails to receive a heartbeat in time and triggers an unnecessary rebalance.\n+\n+Decreasing the heartbeat interval reduces the chance of accidental rebalancing, but more frequent heartbeats increases the overhead on broker resources.\n+\n+== Handling uncommitted offsets\n+\n+Use the `auto.offset.reset` property to control how the consumer behaves when offsets are not committed.\n+This could be because the consumer was down for a period.\n+To avoid data loss, but increase the amount of processing, use the `earliest` value to start at the beginning of the partition.\n+The other allowed value is `latest`, which starts at the end of the partition, and consequently means some messages are missed.\n+\n+----\n+# ...\n+heatbeat.interval.ms=3000 <1>", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid":

property are in the same group.\n+One of the consumers in the group is elected leader and decides how the partitions that the consumers are interested in should be assigned to the consumers.\n+Each partition can only be assigned to a single consumer.\n+\n+If you do not already have as many consumers as partitions,\n+you can scale data consumption by adding more consumer instances with the same `group.id`.\n+Adding more consumers to a group than there are partitions will not help throughput,\n+but it does mean that there are consumers on standby should one stop functioning.\n+If you can meet throughput goals with fewer consumers, you save on resources.\n+\n+Consumers within the same consumer group send offset commits and heartbeats to the same broker.\n+So the greater the number of consumers in the group, the higher the request load on the broker.\n+\n+----\n+# ...\n+group.id=my-group-id <1>\n+# ...\n+----\n+<1> Add a consumer to a consumer group using a group id.\n+\n+== Message ordering guarantees\n+\n+Kafka brokers receive fetch requests from consumers that ask the broker to send messages from a list of topics, partitions and offset positions.\n+\n+A consumer observes messages in a single partition in the same order that they were committed to the broker,\n+which means that Kafka *only* provides ordering guarantees for messages in a single partition.\n+Conversely, if a consumer is consuming messages from multiple partitions, the order of messages in different partitions as observed by the consumer does not necessarily reflect the order in which they were sent.\n+\n+If you want a strict ordering of messages from one topic, use one partition.\n+\n+== Optimizing throughput and latency\n+\n+Control the number of messages returned when your client application calls `KafkaConsumer.poll()`.\n+\n+Use the `fetch.max.wait.ms` and `fetch.min.bytes` properties to increase the minimum amount of data fetched by the consumer from the Kafka broker.\n+Time-based batching is configured using `fetch.max.wait.ms`, and size-based batching is configured using `fetch.min.bytes`.\n+\n+If CPU utilization in the consumer or broker is high, it might be because there are too many requests from the consumer.\n+You can adjust `fetch.max.wait.ms` and `fetch.min.bytes` properties higher so that there are fewer requests and messages are delivered in bigger batches.\n+By adjusting higher, throughput is improved with some cost to latency.\n+You can also adjust higher if the amount of data being produced is low.\n+\n+For example, if you set `fetch.max.wait.ms` to 500ms and `fetch.min.bytes` to 16384 bytes,\n+when Kafka receives a fetch request from the consumer it will respond when the first of either threshold is reached.\n+\n+Conversely, you can adjust the `fetch.max.wait.ms` and `fetch.min.bytes` properties lower to improve end-to-end latency.\n+\n+----\n+# ...\n+fetch.max.wait.ms=500

batch size in bytes is used, a request is sent when the minimum is reached, or messages have been queued for longer than `fetch.max.wait.ms` (whichever comes sooner).\n+Adding the delay allows batches to accumulate messages up to the batch size.\n+\n+.Lowering latency by increasing the fetch request size\n+\n+Use the `fetch.max.bytes` and `max.partition.fetch.bytes` properties to increase the maximum amount of data fetched by the consumer from the Kafka broker.\n+\n+The `fetch.max.bytes` property sets a maximum limit in bytes on the amount of data fetched from the broker at one time,\n+\n+The `max.partition.fetch.bytes` sets a maximum limit in bytes on how much data is returned for each partition,\n+which must always be larger than the number of bytes set in the broker or topic configuration for `max.message.bytes`.\n+\n+The maximum amount of memory a client can consume is approximately:\n+\n+[source,shell,subs=\"+quotes,attributes\"]\n+----\n+_NUMBER-OF-BROKERS_ * fetch.max.bytes and _NUMBER-OF-PARTITIONS_ * max.partition.fetch.bytes\n+----\n+\n+If memory usage can accommodate it, you can increase the values of these two properties.\n+By allowing more data in

data in bytes returned for a fetch request.\n+<2> The maximum amount of data in bytes returned for each partition.\n+\n+== Avoiding data loss or duplication when committing offsets\n+\n+The Kafka _auto-commit mechanism_ allows a consumer to commit the offsets of messages automatically.\n+If enabled, the consumer will commit offsets received from polling the broker at 5000ms intervals.\n+\n+The auto-commit mechanism is convenient, but it introduces a risk of data loss and duplication.\n+If a consumer has fetched and transformed a number of messages, but the system crashes with processed messages in the consumer buffer when performing an auto-commit, that data is lost.\n+If the system crashes after processing the messages, but before performing the auto-commit, the data is duplicated on another consumer instance after rebalancing.\n+\n+To minimize the likelihood of data loss or duplication, set `enable.auto.commit` to `false` and develop your client application to have more control over committing offsets.\n+Or use `auto.commit.interval.ms=1` to decrease the intervals between commits.\n+\n+By setting to `enable.auto.commit` to `false`, you can commit offsets after *all* processing has been performed and the message has been consumed.\n+For example, you can set up your application to call the Kafka `commitSync` and `commitAsync` commit APIs.\n+\n+The `commitSync` API commits the offsets in a message batch returned from polling.\n+You call the API when you are finished processing all the messages in the batch.\n+If you use the `commitSync` API, the application will not poll for new messages until the last offset in the batch is committed.\n+If this impacts throughput unduly, you can commit less frequently,\n+or you can use the `commitAsync` API.\n+The `commitAsync` API does not wait for the broker to respond to a commit request,\n+but risks creating more duplicates when rebalancing.\n+A common approach is to combine both commit APIs in an application, with the `commitSync` API used just before shutting the consumer down or rebalancing to make sure the final commit is successful.\n+\n+Also, consider using transactional ids and having idempotence enabled (`enable.idempotence=true`) on the producer side to guarantee exactly once delivery.\n+On the consumer side, you can then use the `isolation.level` property to control how transactional messages are read by the consumer.\n+\n+The `isolation.level` property has two valid values:\n+\n+* `read_committed`\n+* `read_uncommitted` (default)\n+\n+Use `read_committed` to ensure that only transactional messages that have been committed are read by the consumer.\n+However, this will cause an increase in end-to-end latency, because the consumer won\u2019t be able to return a message until the brokers have written the transaction markers that record the result of the transaction (_committed_ or _aborted_).", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid":

Scaling data consumption using consumer groups\n+\n+Consumer groups share a typically large data stream generated by one or multiple producers from a given topic.\n+Consumers with the same `group.id` property are in the same group.\n+One of the consumers in the group is elected leader and decides how the partitions that the consumers are interested in should be assigned to the consumers.\n+Each partition can only be assigned to a single consumer.\n+\n+If you do not already have as many consumers as partitions,\n+you can scale data consumption by adding more consumer instances with the same `group.id`.\n+Adding more consumers to a group than there are partitions will not help throughput,\n+but it does mean that there are consumers on standby should one stop functioning.\n+If you can meet throughput goals with fewer consumers, you save on resources.\n+\n+Consumers within the same consumer group send offset commits and heartbeats to the same broker.\n+So the greater the number of consumers in the group, the higher the request load on the broker.\n+\n+----\n+# ...\n+group.id=my-group-id <1>\n+# ...\n+----\n+<1> Add a consumer to a consumer group using a group id.\n+\n+== Message ordering guarantees\n+\n+Kafka brokers receive fetch requests from consumers that ask the broker to send messages from a list of topics, partitions and offset positions.\n+\n+A consumer observes messages in a single partition in the same order that they were committed to the broker,\n+which means that Kafka *only* provides ordering guarantees for messages in a single partition.\n+Conversely, if a consumer is consuming messages from multiple partitions, the order of messages in different partitions as observed by the consumer does not necessarily reflect the order in which they were sent.\n+\n+If you want a strict ordering of messages from one topic, use one partition.\n+\n+== Optimizing throughput and latency\n+\n+Control the number of messages returned when your client application calls `KafkaConsumer.poll()`.\n+\n+Use the `fetch.max.wait.ms` and `fetch.min.bytes` properties to increase the minimum amount of data fetched by the consumer from the Kafka broker.\n+Time-based batching is configured using `fetch.max.wait.ms`, and size-based batching is configured using `fetch.min.bytes`.\n+\n+If CPU utilization in the consumer or broker is high, it might be because there are too many requests from the consumer.\n+You can adjust `fetch.max.wait.ms` and `fetch.min.bytes` properties higher so that there are fewer requests and messages are delivered in bigger batches.\n+By adjusting higher, throughput is improved with some cost to latency.\n+You can also adjust higher if the amount of data being produced is low.\n+\n+For example, if you set `fetch.max.wait.ms` to 500ms and `fetch.min.bytes` to 16384 bytes,\n+when Kafka receives a fetch request from the consumer it will respond when the first of either threshold is reached.\n+\n+Conversely, you can adjust the `fetch.max.wait.ms` and `fetch.min.bytes` properties lower to improve end-to-end latency.\n+\n+----\n+# ...\n+fetch.max.wait.ms=500 <1>\n+fetch.min.bytes=16384 <2>\n+# ...\n+----\n+<1> The maximum time in milliseconds the broker will wait before completing fetch requests.\n+The default is `500` milliseconds.\n+<2> If a minimum batch size in bytes is used, a request is sent when the minimum is reached, or messages have been queued for longer than `fetch.max.wait.ms` (whichever comes sooner).\n+Adding the delay allows batches to accumulate messages up to the batch size.\n+\n+.Lowering latency by increasing the fetch request size\n+\n+Use the `fetch.max.bytes` and `max.partition.fetch.bytes` properties to increase the maximum amount of data fetched by the consumer from the Kafka broker.\n+\n+The `fetch.max.bytes` property sets a maximum limit in bytes on the amount of data fetched from the broker at one time,\n+\n+The `max.partition.fetch.bytes` sets a maximum limit in bytes on how much data is returned for each partition,\n+which must always be larger than the number of bytes set in the broker or topic configuration for `max.message.bytes`.\n+\n+The maximum amount of memory a client can consume is approximately:\n+\n+[source,shell,subs=\"+quotes,attributes\"]\n+----\n+_NUMBER-OF-BROKERS_ * fetch.max.bytes and _NUMBER-OF-PARTITIONS_ * max.partition.fetch.bytes\n+----\n+\n+If memory usage can accommodate it, you can increase the values of these two properties.\n+By allowing more data in each request, latency is improved as there are fewer fetch requests.\n+\n+----\n+# ...\n+fetch.max.bytes=52428800 <1>\n+max.partition.fetch.bytes=1048576 <2>\n+# ...\n+----\n+<1> The maximum amount of data in bytes returned for a fetch request.\n+<2> The maximum amount of data in bytes returned for each partition.\n+\n+== Avoiding data loss or duplication when committing offsets\n+\n+The Kafka _auto-commit mechanism_ allows a consumer to commit the offsets of messages automatically.\n+If enabled, the consumer will commit offsets received from polling the broker at 5000ms intervals.\n+\n+The auto-commit mechanism is convenient, but it introduces a risk of data loss and duplication.\n+If a consumer has fetched and transformed a number of messages, but the system crashes with processed messages in the consumer buffer when performing an auto-commit, that data is lost.\n+If the system crashes after processing the messages, but before performing the auto-commit, the data is duplicated on another consumer instance after rebalancing.\n+\n+To minimize the likelihood of data loss or duplication, set `enable.auto.commit` to `false` and develop your client application to have more control over committing offsets.\n+Or use `auto.commit.interval.ms=1` to decrease the intervals between commits.\n+\n+By setting to `enable.auto.commit` to `false`, you can commit offsets after *all* processing has been performed and the message has been consumed.\n+For example, you can set up your application to call the Kafka `commitSync` and `commitAsync` commit APIs.\n+\n+The `commitSync` API commits the offsets in a message batch returned from polling.\n+You call the API when you are finished processing all the messages in the batch.\n+If you use the `commitSync` API, the application will not poll for new messages until the last offset in the batch is committed.\n+If this impacts throughput unduly, you can commit less frequently,\n+or you can use the `commitAsync` API.\n+The `commitAsync` API does not wait for the broker to respond to a commit request,\n+but risks creating more duplicates when rebalancing.\n+A common approach is to combine both commit APIs in an application, with the `commitSync` API used just before shutting the consumer down or rebalancing to make sure the final commit is successful.\n+\n+Also, consider using transactional ids and having idempotence enabled (`enable.idempotence=true`) on the producer side to guarantee exactly once delivery.\n+On the consumer side, you can then use the `isolation.level` property to control how transactional messages are read by the consumer.\n+\n+The `isolation.level` property has two valid values:\n+\n+* `read_committed`\n+* `read_uncommitted` (default)\n+\n+Use `read_committed` to ensure that only transactional messages that have been committed are read by the consumer.\n+However, this will cause an increase in end-to-end latency, because the consumer won\u2019t be able to return a message until the brokers have written the transaction markers that record the result of the transaction (_committed_ or _aborted_).\n+\n+----\n+# ...\n+enable.auto.commit=false <1>\n+isolation.level=read_committed <2>\n+# ...\n+----\n+<1> Auto commit is set to false to provide more control over committing offsets\n+<2> Set to `read_committed` so that only committed messages are read by the consumer.\n+\n+== Recovering from failure to avoid data loss\n+\n+Use the `session.timeout.ms` and `heartbeat.interval.ms` properties to configure the time taken to check and recover from consumer failure within a consumer group.\n+\n+The `session.timeout.ms` property specifies the maximum amount of time in milliseconds a consumer within a consumer group can be out of contact with a broker before being considered inactive and a _rebalancing_ is triggered between the active consumers in the group.\n+When the group rebalances, the partitions are reassigned to the members of the group.\n+\n+The `heartbeat.interval.ms` property specifies the interval in milliseconds between _heartbeat_ checks to the consumer group coordinator to indicate that the consumer is active and connected.\n+The heartbeat interval must be lower, usually by a third, than the session timeout interval.\n+\n+If you set the `session.timeout.ms` property lower, failing consumers are detected earlier, and rebalancing can take place quicker.\n+However, take care not to set the timeout so low that the broker fails to receive a heartbeat in time and triggers an unnecessary rebalance.\n+\n+Decreasing the heartbeat interval reduces the chance of accidental rebalancing, but more frequent heartbeats increases the overhead on broker resources.\n+\n+== Managing offset policy\n+\n+Use the `auto.offset.reset` property to control how a consumer behaves when no offsets have been committed,\n+or a committed offset is no longer valid or deleted.\n+\n+Suppose a consumer fails before an offset has been committed.\n+The consumer that then assumes responsibility for consuming the messages will start reading from the reassigned topic partition based on the reset policy.\n+The default value is `latest`, which starts at the end of the partition, and consequently means some messages are missed.\n+To avoid data loss, but increase the amount of processing, use the `earliest` value to start at the beginning of the partition.\n+\n+----\n+# ...\n+heartbeat.interval.ms=3000 <1>\n+session.timeout.ms=10000 <2>\n+auto.offset.reset=earliest <3>\n+# ...\n+----\n+<1> Adjust the heartbeat interval lower according to anticipated rebalances.\n+<2> If no heartbeats are received by the kafka broker before the timeout duration expires, the consumer is removed from the

Scaling data consumption using consumer groups\n+\n+Consumer groups share a typically large data stream generated by one or multiple producers from a given topic.\n+Consumers with the same `group.id` property are in the same group.\n+One of the consumers in the group is elected leader and decides how the partitions that the consumers are interested in should be assigned to the consumers.\n+Each partition can only be assigned to a single consumer.\n+\n+If you do not already have as many consumers as partitions,\n+you can scale data consumption by adding more consumer instances with the same `group.id`.\n+Adding more consumers to a group than there are partitions will not help throughput,\n+but it does mean that there are consumers on standby should one stop functioning.\n+If you can meet throughput goals with fewer consumers, you save on resources.\n+\n+Consumers within the same consumer group send offset commits and heartbeats to the same broker.\n+So the greater the number of consumers in the group, the higher the request load on the broker.\n+\n+----\n+# ...\n+group.id=my-group-id <1>\n+# ...\n+----\n+<1> Add a consumer to a consumer group using a group id.\n+\n+== Message ordering guarantees\n+\n+Kafka brokers receive fetch requests from consumers that ask the broker to send messages from a list of topics, partitions and offset positions.\n+\n+A consumer observes messages in a single partition in the same order that they were committed to the broker,\n+which means that Kafka *only* provides ordering guarantees for messages in a single partition.\n+Conversely, if a consumer is consuming messages from multiple partitions, the order of messages in different partitions as observed by the consumer does not necessarily reflect the order in which they were sent.\n+\n+If you want a strict ordering of messages from one topic, use one partition.\n+\n+== Optimizing throughput and latency\n+\n+Control the number of messages returned when your client application calls `KafkaConsumer.poll()`.\n+\n+Use the `fetch.max.wait.ms` and `fetch.min.bytes` properties to increase the minimum amount of data fetched by the consumer from the Kafka broker.\n+Time-based batching is configured using `fetch.max.wait.ms`, and size-based batching is configured using `fetch.min.bytes`.\n+\n+If CPU utilization in the consumer or broker is high, it might be because there are too many requests from the consumer.\n+You can adjust `fetch.max.wait.ms` and `fetch.min.bytes` properties higher so that there are fewer requests and messages are delivered in bigger batches.\n+By adjusting higher, throughput is improved with some cost to latency.\n+You can also adjust higher if the amount of data being produced is low.\n+\n+For example, if you set `fetch.max.wait.ms` to 500ms and `fetch.min.bytes` to 16384 bytes,\n+when Kafka receives a fetch request from the consumer it will respond when the first of either threshold is reached.\n+\n+Conversely, you can adjust the `fetch.max.wait.ms` and `fetch.min.bytes` properties lower to improve end-to-end latency.\n+\n+----\n+# ...\n+fetch.max.wait.ms=500 <1>\n+fetch.min.bytes=16384 <2>\n+# ...\n+----\n+<1> The maximum time in milliseconds the broker will wait before completing fetch requests.\n+The default is `500` milliseconds.\n+<2> If a minimum batch size in bytes is used, a request is sent when the minimum is reached, or messages have been queued for longer than `fetch.max.wait.ms` (whichever comes sooner).\n+Adding the delay allows batches to accumulate messages up to the batch size.\n+\n+.Lowering latency by increasing the fetch request size\n+\n+Use the `fetch.max.bytes` and `max.partition.fetch.bytes` properties to increase the maximum amount of data fetched by the consumer from the Kafka broker.\n+\n+The `fetch.max.bytes` property sets a maximum limit in bytes on the amount of data fetched from the broker at one time,\n+\n+The `max.partition.fetch.bytes` sets a maximum limit in bytes on how much data is returned for each partition,\n+which must always be larger than the number of bytes set in the broker or topic configuration for `max.message.bytes`.\n+\n+The maximum amount of memory a client can consume is approximately:\n+\n+[source,shell,subs=\"+quotes,attributes\"]\n+----\n+_NUMBER-OF-BROKERS_ * fetch.max.bytes and _NUMBER-OF-PARTITIONS_ * max.partition.fetch.bytes\n+----\n+\n+If memory usage can accommodate it, you can increase the values of these two properties.\n+By allowing more data in each request, latency is improved as there are fewer fetch requests.\n+\n+----\n+# ...\n+fetch.max.bytes=52428800 <1>\n+max.partition.fetch.bytes=1048576 <2>\n+# ...\n+----\n+<1> The maximum amount of data in bytes returned for a fetch request.\n+<2> The maximum amount of data in bytes returned for each partition.\n+\n+== Avoiding data loss or duplication when committing offsets\n+\n+The Kafka _auto-commit mechanism_ allows a consumer to commit the offsets of messages automatically.\n+If enabled, the consumer will commit offsets received from polling the broker at 5000ms intervals.\n+\n+The auto-commit mechanism is convenient, but it introduces a risk of data loss and duplication.\n+If a consumer has fetched and transformed a number of messages, but the system crashes with processed messages in the consumer buffer when performing an auto-commit, that data is lost.\n+If the system crashes after processing the messages, but before performing the auto-commit, the data is duplicated on another consumer instance after rebalancing.\n+\n+To minimize the likelihood of data loss or duplication, set `enable.auto.commit` to `false` and develop your client application to have more control over committing offsets.\n+Or use `auto.commit.interval.ms=1` to decrease the intervals between commits.\n+\n+By setting to `enable.auto.commit` to `false`, you can commit offsets after *all* processing has been performed and the message has been consumed.\n+For example, you can set up your application to call the Kafka `commitSync` and `commitAsync` commit APIs.\n+\n+The `commitSync` API commits the offsets in a message batch returned from polling.\n+You call the API when you are finished processing all the messages in the batch.\n+If you use the `commitSync` API, the application will not poll for new messages until the last offset in the batch is committed.\n+If this impacts throughput unduly, you can commit less frequently,\n+or you can use the `commitAsync` API.\n+The `commitAsync` API does not wait for the broker to respond to a commit request,\n+but risks creating more duplicates when rebalancing.\n+A common approach is to combine both commit APIs in an application, with the `commitSync` API used just before shutting the consumer down or rebalancing to make sure the final commit is successful.\n+\n+Also, consider using transactional ids and having idempotence enabled (`enable.idempotence=true`) on the producer side to guarantee exactly once delivery.\n+On the consumer side, you can then use the `isolation.level` property to control how transactional messages are read by the consumer.\n+\n+The `isolation.level` property has two valid values:\n+\n+* `read_committed`\n+* `read_uncommitted` (default)\n+\n+Use `read_committed` to ensure that only transactional messages that have been committed are read by the consumer.\n+However, this will cause an increase in end-to-end latency, because the consumer won\u2019t be able to return a message until the brokers have written the transaction markers that record the result of the transaction (_committed_ or _aborted_).\n+\n+----\n+# ...\n+enable.auto.commit=false <1>\n+isolation.level=read_committed <2>\n+# ...\n+----\n+<1> Auto commit is set to false to provide more control over committing offsets\n+<2> Set to `read_committed` so that only committed messages are read by the consumer.\n+\n+== Recovering from failure to avoid data loss\n+\n+Use the `session.timeout.ms` and `heartbeat.interval.ms` properties to configure the time taken to check and recover from consumer failure within a consumer group.\n+\n+The `session.timeout.ms` property specifies the maximum amount of time in milliseconds a consumer within a consumer group can be out of contact with a broker before being considered inactive and a _rebalancing_ is triggered between the active consumers in the group.\n+When the group rebalances, the partitions are reassigned to the members of the group.\n+\n+The `heartbeat.interval.ms` property specifies the interval in milliseconds between _heartbeat_ checks to the consumer group coordinator to indicate that the consumer is active and connected.\n+The heartbeat interval must be lower, usually by a third, than the session timeout interval.\n+\n+If you set the `session.timeout.ms` property lower, failing consumers are detected earlier, and rebalancing can take place quicker.\n+However, take care not to set the timeout so low that the broker fails to receive a heartbeat in time and triggers an unnecessary rebalance.\n+\n+Decreasing the heartbeat interval reduces the chance of accidental rebalancing, but more frequent heartbeats increases the overhead on broker resources.\n+\n+== Managing offset policy\n+\n+Use the `auto.offset.reset` property to control how a consumer behaves when no offsets have been committed,\n+or a committed offset is no longer valid or deleted.\n+\n+Suppose a consumer fails before an offset has been committed.\n+The consumer that then assumes responsibility for consuming the messages will start reading from the reassigned topic partition based on the reset policy.\n+The default value is `latest`, which starts at the end of the partition, and consequently means some messages are missed.\n+To avoid data loss, but increase the amount of processing, use the `earliest` value to start at the beginning of the partition.\n+\n+----\n+# ...\n+heartbeat.interval.ms=3000 <1>\n+session.timeout.ms=10000 <2>\n+auto.offset.reset=earliest <3>\n+# ...\n+----\n+<1> Adjust the heartbeat interval lower according to anticipated rebalances.\n+<2> If no heartbeats are received by the kafka broker before the timeout duration expires, the consumer is removed from the consumer group and a rebalance is initiated.\n+If the broker configuration has a `group.min.session.timeout.ms` and `group.max.session.timeout.ms`, the session timeout value must be within that range.\n+<3> Set to `earliest` to return to the start of a partition and avoid data loss if offsets were not committed.\n+\n+If the amount of data returned in a single fetch request is large,\n+a timeout might occur before the consumer has processed it.\n+If this is the case, you can lower `max.partition.fetch.bytes` or increase `session.timeout.ms`.\n+\n+== Minimizing the impact of rebalances\n+\n+The rebalancing of a partition between active consumers in a group is the time it takes for:\n+\n+* Consumers to commit their offsets\n+* The new consumer group to be formed\n+* The

guarantees\n+\n+Kafka brokers receive fetch requests from consumers that ask the broker to send messages from a list of topics, partitions and offset positions.\n+\n+A consumer observes messages in a single partition in the same order that they were committed to the broker,\n+which means that Kafka *only* provides ordering guarantees for messages in a single partition.\n+Conversely, if a consumer is consuming messages from multiple partitions, the order of messages in different partitions as observed by the consumer does not necessarily reflect the order in which they were sent.\n+\n+If you want a strict ordering of messages from one topic, use one partition per consumer.\n+\n+== Optimizing throughput and latency\n+\n+Control the number of messages returned when your client application calls `KafkaConsumer.poll()`.\n+\n+Use the `fetch.max.wait.ms` and `fetch.min.bytes` properties to increase the minimum amount of data fetched by the consumer from the Kafka broker.\n+Time-based

batches.\n+By adjusting higher, throughput is improved with some cost to latency.\n+You can also adjust higher if the amount of data being produced is low.\n+\n+For example, if you set `fetch.max.wait.ms` to 500ms and `fetch.min.bytes` to 16384 bytes,\n+when Kafka receives a fetch request from the consumer it will respond when the first of either threshold is

Scaling data consumption using consumer groups\n+\n+Consumer groups share a typically large data stream generated by one or multiple producers from a given topic.\n+Consumers with the same `group.id` property are in the same group.\n+One of the consumers in the group is elected leader and decides how the partitions are assigned to the consumers in the group.\n+Each partition can only be assigned to a single consumer.\n+\n+If you do not already have as many consumers as partitions,\n+you can scale data consumption by adding more consumer instances with the same `group.id`.\n+Adding more consumers to a group than there are partitions will not help throughput,\n+but it does mean that there are consumers on standby should one stop functioning.\n+If you can meet throughput goals with fewer consumers, you save on resources.\n+\n+Consumers within the same consumer group send offset commits and heartbeats to the same broker.\n+So the greater the number of consumers in the group, the higher the request load on the broker.\n+\n+----\n+# ...\n+group.id=my-group-id <1>\n+# ...\n+----\n+<1> Add a consumer to a consumer group using a group id.\n+\n+== Message ordering guarantees\n+\n+Kafka brokers receive fetch requests from consumers that ask the broker to send messages from a list of topics, partitions and offset positions.\n+\n+A consumer observes messages in a single partition in the same order that they were committed to the broker,\n+which means that Kafka *only* provides ordering guarantees for messages in a single partition.\n+Conversely, if a consumer is consuming messages from multiple partitions, the order of messages in different partitions as observed by the consumer does not necessarily reflect the order in which they were sent.\n+\n+If you want a strict ordering of messages from one topic, use one partition per consumer.\n+\n+== Optimizing throughput and latency\n+\n+Control the number of messages returned when your client application calls `KafkaConsumer.poll()`.\n+\n+Use the `fetch.max.wait.ms` and `fetch.min.bytes` properties to increase the minimum amount of data fetched by the consumer from the Kafka broker.\n+Time-based batching is configured using `fetch.max.wait.ms`, and size-based batching is configured using `fetch.min.bytes`.\n+\n+If CPU utilization in the consumer or broker is high, it might be because there are too many requests from the consumer.\n+You can adjust `fetch.max.wait.ms` and `fetch.min.bytes` properties higher so that there are fewer requests and messages are delivered in bigger batches.\n+By adjusting higher, throughput is improved with some cost to latency.\n+You can also adjust higher if the amount of data being produced is low.\n+\n+For example, if you set `fetch.max.wait.ms` to 500ms and `fetch.min.bytes` to 16384 bytes,\n+when Kafka receives a fetch request from the consumer it will respond when the first of either threshold is reached.\n+\n+Conversely, you can adjust the `fetch.max.wait.ms` and `fetch.min.bytes` properties lower to improve end-to-end latency.\n+\n+----\n+# ...\n+fetch.max.wait.ms=500

batch size in bytes is used, a request is sent when the minimum is reached, or messages have been queued for longer than `fetch.max.wait.ms` (whichever comes sooner).\n+Adding the delay allows batches to accumulate messages up to the batch size.\n+\n+.Lowering latency by increasing the fetch request size\n+\n+Use the `fetch.max.bytes` and `max.partition.fetch.bytes` properties to increase the maximum amount of data fetched by the consumer from the Kafka broker.\n+\n+The `fetch.max.bytes` property sets a maximum limit in bytes on the amount of data fetched from the broker at one time.\n+\n+The `max.partition.fetch.bytes` sets a maximum limit in bytes on how much data is returned for each partition,\n+which must always be larger than the number of bytes set in the broker or topic configuration for `max.message.bytes`.\n+\n+The maximum amount of memory a client can consume is calculated approximately as:\n+\n+[source,shell,subs=\"+quotes,attributes\"]\n+----\n+_NUMBER-OF-BROKERS_ * fetch.max.bytes and _NUMBER-OF-PARTITIONS_ * max.partition.fetch.bytes\n+----\n+\n+If memory usage can accommodate it, you can increase the values of these two properties.\n+By allowing more data in each request, latency is improved as there are fewer fetch requests.\n+\n+----\n+# ...\n+fetch.max.bytes=52428800

partition.\n+\n+== Avoiding data loss or duplication when committing offsets\n+\n+The Kafka _auto-commit mechanism_ allows a consumer to commit the offsets of messages automatically.\n+If enabled, the consumer will commit offsets received from polling the broker at 5000ms intervals.\n+\n+The auto-commit mechanism is convenient, but it introduces a risk of data loss and duplication.\n+If a consumer has fetched and transformed a number of messages, but the system crashes with processed messages in the consumer buffer when performing an auto-commit, that data is lost.\n+If the system crashes after processing the messages, but before performing the auto-commit, the data is duplicated on another consumer instance after rebalancing.\n+\n+Auto-committing can avoid data loss only when all messages are processed before the next poll to the broker,\n+or the consumer closes.\n+\n+To minimize the likelihood of data loss or duplication, you can set `enable.auto.commit` to `false` and develop your client application to have more control over committing offsets.\n+Or you can use `auto.commit.interval.ms=1` to decrease the intervals between commits.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null,

to a single consumer.\n+\n+If you do not already have as many consumers as partitions,\n+you can scale data consumption by adding more consumer instances with the same `group.id`.\n+Adding more consumers to a group than there are partitions will not help throughput,\n+but it does mean that there are consumers on standby should one stop functioning.\n+If you can meet throughput goals with fewer consumers, you save on resources.\n+\n+Consumers within the same consumer group send offset commits and heartbeats to the same broker.\n+So the greater the number of consumers in the group, the higher the request load on the broker.\n+\n+----\n+# ...\n+group.id=my-group-id <1>\n+# ...\n+----\n+<1> Add a consumer to a consumer group using a group id.\n+\n+== Message ordering guarantees\n+\n+Kafka brokers receive fetch requests from consumers that ask the broker to send messages from a list of topics, partitions and offset positions.\n+\n+A consumer observes messages in a single partition in the same order that they were committed to the broker,\n+which means that Kafka *only* provides ordering guarantees for messages in a single partition.\n+Conversely, if a consumer is consuming messages from multiple partitions, the order of messages in different partitions as observed by the consumer does not necessarily reflect the order in which they were sent.\n+\n+If you want a strict ordering of messages from one topic, use one partition per consumer.\n+\n+== Optimizing throughput and latency\n+\n+Control the number of messages returned when your client application calls `KafkaConsumer.poll()`.\n+\n+Use the `fetch.max.wait.ms` and `fetch.min.bytes` properties to increase the minimum amount of data fetched by the consumer from the Kafka broker.\n+Time-based batching is configured using `fetch.max.wait.ms`, and size-based batching is configured using `fetch.min.bytes`.\n+\n+If CPU utilization in the consumer or broker is high, it might be because there are too many requests from the consumer.\n+You can adjust `fetch.max.wait.ms` and `fetch.min.bytes` properties higher so that there are fewer requests and messages are delivered in bigger batches.\n+By adjusting higher, throughput is improved with some cost to latency.\n+You can also adjust higher if the amount of data being produced is low.\n+\n+For example, if you set `fetch.max.wait.ms` to 500ms and `fetch.min.bytes` to 16384 bytes,\n+when Kafka receives a fetch request from the consumer it will respond when the first of either threshold is reached.\n+\n+Conversely, you can adjust the `fetch.max.wait.ms` and `fetch.min.bytes` properties lower to improve end-to-end latency.\n+\n+----\n+# ...\n+fetch.max.wait.ms=500

batch size in bytes is used, a request is sent when the minimum is reached, or messages have been queued for longer than `fetch.max.wait.ms` (whichever comes sooner).\n+Adding the delay allows batches to accumulate messages up to the batch size.\n+\n+.Lowering latency by increasing the fetch request size\n+\n+Use the `fetch.max.bytes` and `max.partition.fetch.bytes` properties to increase the maximum amount of data fetched by the consumer from the Kafka broker.\n+\n+The `fetch.max.bytes` property sets a maximum limit in bytes on the amount of data fetched from the broker at one time.\n+\n+The `max.partition.fetch.bytes` sets a maximum limit in bytes on how much data is returned for each partition,\n+which must always be larger than the number of bytes set in the broker or topic configuration for `max.message.bytes`.\n+\n+The maximum amount of memory a client can consume is calculated approximately as:\n+\n+[source,shell,subs=\"+quotes,attributes\"]\n+----\n+_NUMBER-OF-BROKERS_ * fetch.max.bytes and _NUMBER-OF-PARTITIONS_ * max.partition.fetch.bytes\n+----\n+\n+If memory usage can accommodate it, you can increase the values of these two properties.\n+By allowing more data in each request, latency is improved as there are fewer fetch requests.\n+\n+----\n+# ...\n+fetch.max.bytes=52428800

partition.\n+\n+== Avoiding data loss or duplication when committing offsets\n+\n+The Kafka _auto-commit mechanism_ allows a consumer to commit the offsets of messages automatically.\n+If enabled, the consumer will commit offsets received from polling the broker at 5000ms intervals.\n+\n+The auto-commit mechanism is convenient, but it introduces a risk of data loss and duplication.\n+If a consumer has fetched and transformed a number of messages, but the system crashes with processed messages in the consumer buffer when performing an auto-commit, that data is lost.\n+If the system crashes after processing the messages, but before performing the auto-commit, the data is duplicated on another consumer instance after rebalancing.\n+\n+Auto-committing can avoid data loss only when all messages are processed before the next poll to the broker,\n+or the consumer closes.\n+\n+To minimize the likelihood of data loss or duplication, you can set `enable.auto.commit` to `false` and develop your client application to have more control over committing offsets.\n+Or you can use `auto.commit.interval.ms=1` to decrease the intervals between commits.\n+\n+By setting to `enable.auto.commit` to `false`, you can commit offsets after *all* processing has been performed and the message has been consumed.\n+For example, you can set up your application to call the Kafka `commitSync` and `commitAsync` commit APIs.\n+\n+The `commitSync` API commits the offsets in a message batch returned from polling.\n+You call the API when you are finished processing all the messages in the batch.\n+If you use the `commitSync` API, the application will not poll for new messages until the last offset in the batch is committed.\n+If this negatively affects throughput, you can commit less frequently,\n+or you can use the `commitAsync` API.\n+The `commitAsync` API does not wait for the broker to respond to a commit request,\n+but risks creating more duplicates when rebalancing.\n+A common approach is to combine both commit APIs in an application, with the `commitSync` API used just before shutting the consumer down or rebalancing to make sure the final commit is successful.\n+\n+Also, consider using transactional ids and having idempotence enabled (`enable.idempotence=true`) on the producer side to guarantee exactly-once delivery.\n+On the consumer side, you can then use the `isolation.level` property to control how transactional messages are read by the consumer.\n+\n+The `isolation.level` property has two valid values:\n+\n+* `read_committed`\n+* `read_uncommitted` (default)\n+\n+Use `read_committed` to ensure that only transactional messages that have been committed are read by the consumer.\n+However, this will cause an increase in end-to-end latency, because the consumer will not be able to return a message until the brokers have written the transaction markers that record the result of the transaction (_committed_ or _aborted_).\n+\n+----\n+# ...\n+enable.auto.commit=false <1>\n+isolation.level=read_committed <2>\n+# ...\n+----\n+<1> Auto commit is set to false to provide more control over committing offsets.\n+<2> Set to `read_committed` so that only committed messages are read by the consumer.\n+\n+== Recovering from failure to avoid data loss\n+\n+Use the `session.timeout.ms` and `heartbeat.interval.ms` properties to configure the time taken to check and recover from consumer failure within a consumer group.\n+\n+The `session.timeout.ms` property specifies the maximum amount of time in milliseconds a consumer within a consumer group can be out of contact with a broker before being considered inactive and a _rebalancing_ is triggered between the active consumers in the group.\n+When the group rebalances, the partitions are reassigned to the members of the group.\n+\n+The `heartbeat.interval.ms` property specifies the interval in milliseconds between _heartbeat_ checks to the consumer group coordinator to indicate that the consumer is active and connected.\n+The heartbeat interval must be lower, usually by a third, than the session timeout interval.\n+\n+If you set the `session.timeout.ms` property lower, failing consumers are detected earlier, and rebalancing can take place quicker.\n+However, take care not to set the timeout so low that the broker fails to receive a heartbeat in time and triggers an unnecessary rebalance.\n+\n+Decreasing the heartbeat interval reduces the chance of accidental rebalancing, but more frequent heartbeats increases the overhead on broker resources.\n+\n+== Managing offset policy\n+\n+Use the `auto.offset.reset` property to control how a consumer behaves when no offsets have been committed,\n+or a committed offset is no longer valid or deleted.\n+\n+Suppose a consumer fails before an offset has been committed.\n+The consumer that then assumes responsibility for consuming the messages will start reading from the reassigned topic partition based on the reset policy.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "fe5594803b2d1490093d4334e0836e3f968b2846"}, "originalPosition": 202},
