A Connector.taskConfigs(int maxTasks) is called by Connect to get the tasks configs, but the connector is not obliged to return maxTasks configs. Some connectors (such as the Debezium [MySQL connector}(https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/1.1/connectors/mysql.html)) return fewer task configs. So we would at least need to get the actual number of tasks that the connector is using, via the REST API, rather than copying the value from the spec.\nSomething else to be aware of: for a source connector it's possible that returning >1 task config when there's no way of partitioning the source data will result in duplicated records in the topic, because two or more tasks consume the same events from the source system. In theory people should be writing their connectors to return only 1 task config in that case, but that doesn't mean people actually do that in practice. Turning an autoscaler loose on such connectors would result in dupes.

Otherwise you can in theory run in loop trying to scale more than what is the number of tasks the connector actually runs. So I do not think this is an issue. If you would scale an deployment, it would actually make sure the pods are running, but will also have no control over whether they do something or whether they do duplicate work. So I do not think it is radically different.\nIn general, all what this PR allows is that you can do something like kubectl scale <kind> <name> --replicas N. So on its own this is not different from the user taking the connector and scaling it to N tasks by editing the resource. It does not so any autoscaling, it is just an enabler.\nAchieving some form of autoscaling is more complicated and needs some more steps. For the resources which have the LabalSelector (Connect, Mirror Maker, Bridge), the user can create a HorizontalPodAutoscaler resource and have it to autoscale the resources based on some metric. So the users needs to do some additional deliberate action where (s)he hopefully considers the consequences. Out of the box, the scaling can be done for example based on CPU utilization - but we know that with Kafka this is not sufficient due to consumer groups etc. So user would really need some additional tooling to deal with it.\nWith things such as KafkaConnector, the HPA as far as I know cannot be used because it does not have the label selector (and there is really nothing to select since the resource does not live as pod or any other Kubernetes resource). TBH, I'm not sure how much use would the scale subresource get here unless we (or some user) write some specific tooling around it. But it seems like a small effort and something what would not hurt and might enable interesting patterns.\nA chapter on its own would be probably something like scaling of Kafka topics which is I guess even more tricky (since you cannot scale down).", "url": "https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/pull/3165#discussion_r437036170", "createdAt": "2020-06-08T22:28:52Z", "author": {"login": "scholzj"}, "path": "cluster-operator/src/main/java/io/strimzi/operator/cluster/operator/assembly/AbstractConnectOperator.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -565,6 +565,7 @@ public static void updateStatus(Throwable error, KafkaConnector kafkaConnector2,\n         }\n         StatusUtils.setStatusConditionAndObservedGeneration(connector, status, error != null ?

It changes one way or another. I also after my investigation don't think you can get any better number of tasks. The connector status is using very ambigous and doesn't for example allow you to determine if UNASSIGNED tasks are scaled down or if they are just temporarily unassigned because of node restarts. So for example counting all tasks in status or counting running tasks does not give any reasonable value either.\n\nI say \"I would argue\", because until there are actually scalers for CRs like this it's a bit of a moot point. And perhaps that's an argument for not making the KafkaConnector scalable at this point.\n\nI think this is very unfriendly to the ecosystem. If you wait for the tooling to exist, you basically wait for someone to implement it in a much more complicated way (by hardcoding the mechanism for editing KadkaConnector CR and changing tasksMax number). And then you would implement the scale subresource and tell them hey, you can do this in a much easier way.\n\nDoes the autoscale have such a limit and is it mandatory for it to be set?\n\nI do not think this question has a single answer. AFAIK HorizontalPodAutoscaler has maxReplicas as required value. But there are many ways how to implement autoscaling and I do not know if it applies to all of them. And as I said, HorizontalPodAutoscaler does not apply to KafkaConnector but only to pod based resources.", "url": "https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/pull/3165#discussion_r437957550", "createdAt": "2020-06-10T08:38:22Z", "author": {"login": "scholzj"}, "path": "cluster-operator/src/main/java/io/strimzi/operator/cluster/operator/assembly/AbstractConnectOperator.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -565,6 +565,7 @@ public static void updateStatus(Throwable error, KafkaConnector kafkaConnector2,\n         }\n         StatusUtils.setStatusConditionAndObservedGeneration(connector, status, error != null ?

I'm not against adding scale subresource to KafkaConnector at all.

In general having system A lie to system B about something which system B will use to automated system A seems like it could go wrong, so I want to be pretty sure that there are no negative consequences, as you assert.\n\nthere are many applications which do not scale and yet they have the scale subresource in their deployments and just don't use it.\n\nWell, if there's an established pattern of having the scale in the status not actually reflect the true scale, because it's being ignored then I guess that's fine.

But it would be good to know which operators are already doing this.\n\nI think that depends on the point of view. Imagine a Kafka Consumer running in a Deployment and consuming from a topic with 1 partition. Now when you scale the deployment to 5 replicas, they will be all running and the deployment will report 5 running replicas. But in reality all but one will be idle waiting for some consumer group rebalancer whihc might assign them some partition. Is the deployment lying when saying that there are 5 pod running? And Kafka is just an example - it is not the only application using some kind of locking mechanism and not being able to scale infinitely.\nAs I see it, our situation is not really different. We tell Connect / connector to run N tasks and if in reality for its internal reasons it decides to do some work only in one of them it does not differ from the idle pods in the Kafka Consumer deployment.\nThis is of course a bit my view which might differ from yours.\n\nBy comparing the observedGeneration with the metadata.generation the scaler can infer whether the change in scale that was requests has been actioned by the operator. If the generations match and the status scale is not the spec scale then the scaler can infer that the scaling didn't happen for some reason.\n\nThe main point of the scale subresource is to allow you to deal with scaling without understanding the structure of all resources. The /scale endpoint has a fixed structure given by Kubernetes. So it can be used by applications without understanding our CRDs. If you expect the application to decode the whole CR and understand it (to know where to find the right fields etc.), it would not need the scale subresource since it can directly change the .spec.tasksMax field. The scale subresource abstracts this and makes it easier to scale the resources and at the end allows you to write generic scalers. This is important, because for example for source connectors, you would need a scaler which isn't necessarily Kafka aware but rather understands the source system and maybe never heard about Strimzi.\n\nI'm not saying we have to wait, as such. But since this is the interface that any such tooling will use I do think it's important that we implement something which will actually work when that tooling exists.\n\nTo be honest, I think we will never find out if nobody uses it because we do not allow it to be used. I of course cannto guarantee how it will or will not work with different tools.\n\nSo that means that \"my\" loop is indeed potentially an issue.\n\nWell, when you include infinite number of autoscaling tools which might exist somewhere in the world there will be always some which will screw up and do something crazy ;-)", "url": "https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/pull/3165#discussion_r438074076", "createdAt": "2020-06-10T12:13:20Z", "author": {"login": "scholzj"}, "path": "cluster-operator/src/main/java/io/strimzi/operator/cluster/operator/assembly/AbstractConnectOperator.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -565,6 +565,7 @@ public static void updateStatus(Throwable error, KafkaConnector kafkaConnector2,\n         }\n         StatusUtils.setStatusConditionAndObservedGeneration(connector, status, error != null ?

I guess this is likely to be something that is common to all workloads which scale by sharding and where it's not possible to reshard the workload to adjust to the available processing units (in this case pods).

Your point about UNASSIGNED tasks is valid, but from the PoV of Kafka Connect I think there are good reasons why the scaled-down and mid-reassignment cases are conflated as UNASSIGNED.
