{"data": {"repository": {"pullRequest": {"id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDA5MDk1ODQz", "number": 4077, "title": "Bundle a modern Security Provider (Conscrypt) in the Free builds.", "bodyText": "(edit: for anyone interested in the idea behind this, please see this Conscrypt Bundling Example for more information.)\nFor instance, this solves #2814 for people not using Google services. It also solved other protocol errors I was starting to get on an old device (running android 4.4.4, without Google services installed). I have tested these changes on both 1.8.1 and the current develop branch without any problems (in fact, some episodes seem to download faster but that's probably just placebo). I hope this is acceptable to be included officially in AntennaPod.\nThis does not change the Play builds (it's primarily meant for the F-Droid releases). On Play builds Conscrypt does not get bundled and they get no changes to what protocols and cipher suites are enabled. But I'm almost tempted to suggest dropping the dependency on the Google GMS Provider Installer... By knowing that a modern security provider is always available it's safe to enable TLSv1.3 even on older versions of Android and no need to enable obsolete protocols (like SSLv3) and cipher suites (like TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA).\nI already hardened the security for the Free builds by explicitly enable (and only enable) TLSv1.3 and TLSv1.2 (using the CustomSslSocketFactory, on all versions of Android), and by not enable the two obsolete cipher suites that gets enabled for API<21.\nA few things to keep in mind:\n\nFree builds will increase in size (currently by around 3-4MB)\nThe Conscrypt version specified by conscryptVersion in build.gradle should be updated when new versions are released. But I doubt there will be any serious security issues, especially compared to the often very old providers it will replace on most phones.\nOr just set conscryptVersion to \"latest.release\"? It's an easy solution but messes up reproducible builds and might result in unexpected updates to Conscrypt without anyone noticing and testing before release.\nBuilding \"assembleRelease\" or \"assembleDebug\" will result in errors (since it compiles both \"free\" and \"play\" files). So \"assemblePlayRelease\" or \"assemblePlayDebug\" should be used instead. The makeRelease.sh script already follows this convention. Updating the wiki might be a good idea.\nIt's also now absolutely necessary to pass -PfreeBuild when doing assembleFreeRelease and assembleFreeDebug (again, the wiki will probably need some updating, although Free builds are currently not even mentioned there).\nThe above two points are mentioned in a comment in the top of core/src/free/java/de/danoeh/antennapod/core/ClientConfig.java, because that's where errors will appear if the two points are not followed. Maybe you want to remove it. Or maybe not.", "createdAt": "2020-04-26T14:46:14Z", "url": "https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/pull/4077", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "e1ff4c8763c604c014a62c4c4905737cb92ebebb"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-10-04T13:21:18Z", "author": {"login": "Slinger"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 17, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABcbcEmMABqjMyNzMwMzQyMjg=", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABdOlSpnAH2gAyNDA5MDk1ODQzOjA2ZDIxMmI5MTFhZjFjZTU0ZTAzYzYzYmFkNjliOTllOTM4Y2I0MzA=", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "HeadRefForcePushedEvent", "beforeCommit": {"oid": "d9f9144a04e16cde536d7fcceab7cc9d531fed86", "author": {"user": {"login": "Slinger", "name": "Mats"}}, "url": "https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/commit/d9f9144a04e16cde536d7fcceab7cc9d531fed86", "committedDate": "2020-04-26T14:57:08Z", "message": "Fixed circle static-analysis error\n\nNo code changes, but formatting with comments around else statements\nneeded to be clearer"}, "afterCommit": {"oid": "420d32363e4512b929fb2ee86ec4a0ba4e2f99f2", "author": {"user": {"login": "Slinger", "name": "Mats"}}, "url": "https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/commit/420d32363e4512b929fb2ee86ec4a0ba4e2f99f2", "committedDate": "2020-04-26T15:02:51Z", "message": "Fixed circle static-analysis error\n\nNo code changes, but formatting with comments around else statements\nneeded to be clearer, also some whitespaces should have been avoided..."}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDEzMTA5Nzc5", "url": "https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/pull/4077#pullrequestreview-413109779", "createdAt": "2020-05-16T21:28:11Z", "commit": {"oid": "420d32363e4512b929fb2ee86ec4a0ba4e2f99f2"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNS0xNlQyMToyODoxMVrOGWcvjg==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNS0xNlQyMTozNjozNFrOGWcxjg==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyNjE5Mjc4Mg==", "bodyText": "I think the variable can be inlined without adding \"+\"", "url": "https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/pull/4077#discussion_r426192782", "createdAt": "2020-05-16T21:28:11Z", "author": {"login": "ByteHamster"}, "path": "core/build.gradle", "diffHunk": "@@ -86,7 +86,8 @@ dependencies {\n         playApi \"com.google.android.gms:play-services-cast:$playServicesVersion\"\n         api \"com.google.android.support:wearable:$wearableSupportVersion\"\n     } else {\n-        System.out.println(\"core: free build hack, skipping some dependencies\")\n+        System.out.println(\"core: free build hack, skipping some dependencies and bundling conscrypt (\"+\"$conscryptVersion\"+\")\")", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "420d32363e4512b929fb2ee86ec4a0ba4e2f99f2"}, "originalPosition": 5}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyNjE5MzI5NA==", "bodyText": "Are you sure that this does not break anything?
