Instead of assuming all calls to onReceiver() for MediaButtonReceiver are made by \"software\" buttons (like the playback controls on lockscreen), it now checks if the intent has a non-zero eventTime or downTime, which seems to be a good indicator that it's actually caused by a real button.\nI've tested this on Android 4.4, 5.1 and 10. The controls on the lockscreen still function correctly and it solves #1560 on the device I had that was still affected (the problem of a long press on volume up/down with the screen of would skip track instead of jumping forwards/backwards).\nNote: I don't have a blutooth music controller so I've not been able to check if the functionality remains as expected. This should probably be tested before pulling this officially. (but from what I understand the bluetooth skip button was already handled as jumping forward, so I don't think it's even affected by this code).\nCloses #1560", "createdAt": "2020-06-20T20:35:01Z", "url": "https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/pull/4256", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "410ebfe98c3ae441e57c75ceef3ac34c29ada07d"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-09-14T15:24:20Z", "author": {"login": "Slinger"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 4, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABctOR-rgBqjM0NjUwMDcxNzg=", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABc_NjmtAFqTQ2ODAwOTk2MA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "HeadRefForcePushedEvent", "beforeCommit": {"oid": "479edf7161354e0f8608935ecb2d9b577c98bd74", "author": {"user": {"login": "Slinger", "name": "Mats"}}, "url": "https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/commit/479edf7161354e0f8608935ecb2d9b577c98bd74", "committedDate": "2020-06-20T13:53:29Z", "message": "Fix #1560 for some remaining platforms still affected\n\nAdded extra check in onStartCommand() for PlaybackService to check if\neventTime or downTime are positive (which seems to indicate the intent\nwas generated by a hardware button press instead of a touchscreen tap,\nlike the lockscreen playback controls)."}, "afterCommit": {"oid": "0ca2aa987fa13701811f71b0b8cf3ab560f5abd8", "author": {"user": {"login": "Slinger", "name": "Mats"}}, "url": "https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/commit/0ca2aa987fa13701811f71b0b8cf3ab560f5abd8", "committedDate": "2020-06-20T21:10:39Z", "message": "Fix #1560 for some remaining platforms still affected\n\nAdded extra check in onStartCommand() for PlaybackService to check if\neventTime or downTime are positive (which seems to indicate the intent\nwas generated by a hardware button press instead of a touchscreen tap,\nlike the lockscreen playback controls)."}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "c6edf77fc29de6d50b3be25da5aec1ff42f1554c", "author": {"user": {"login": "Slinger", "name": "Mats"}}, "url": "https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/commit/c6edf77fc29de6d50b3be25da5aec1ff42f1554c", "committedDate": "2020-07-04T19:50:25Z", "message": "Fix #1560 for some remaining platforms still affected\n\nAdded extra check in onStartCommand() for PlaybackService to check if\neventTime or downTime are positive (which seems to indicate the intent\nwas generated by a hardware button press instead of a touchscreen tap,\nlike the lockscreen playback controls)."}}, {"__typename": "HeadRefForcePushedEvent", "beforeCommit": {"oid": "0ca2aa987fa13701811f71b0b8cf3ab560f5abd8", "author": {"user": {"login": "Slinger", "name": "Mats"}}, "url": "https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/commit/0ca2aa987fa13701811f71b0b8cf3ab560f5abd8", "committedDate": "2020-06-20T21:10:39Z", "message": "Fix #1560 for some remaining platforms still affected\n\nAdded extra check in onStartCommand() for PlaybackService to check if\neventTime or downTime are positive (which seems to indicate the intent\nwas generated by a hardware button press instead of a touchscreen tap,\nlike the lockscreen playback controls)."}, "afterCommit": {"oid": "c6edf77fc29de6d50b3be25da5aec1ff42f1554c", "author": {"user": {"login": "Slinger", "name": "Mats"}}, "url": "https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/commit/c6edf77fc29de6d50b3be25da5aec1ff42f1554c", "committedDate": "2020-07-04T19:50:25Z", "message": "Fix #1560 for some remaining platforms still affected\n\nAdded extra check in onStartCommand() for PlaybackService to check if\neventTime or downTime are positive (which seems to indicate the intent\nwas generated by a hardware button press instead of a touchscreen tap,\nlike the lockscreen playback controls)."}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDY4MDA5OTYw", "url": "https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/pull/4256#pullrequestreview-468009960", "createdAt": "2020-08-15T18:24:13Z", "commit": {"oid": "c6edf77fc29de6d50b3be25da5aec1ff42f1554c"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wOC0xNVQxODoyNDoxM1rOHBM2gw==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wOC0xNVQxODoyNDoxM1rOHBM2gw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ3MTAyMTE4Nw==", "bodyText": "Is this documented somewhere?
