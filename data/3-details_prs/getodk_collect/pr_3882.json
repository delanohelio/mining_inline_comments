I just reviewed implemented changes.\nWhy is this the best possible solution? Were any other approaches considered?\nI think it's a bug fixed in version 2.2.0-rc01 I don't know why we kept arch (Pre-AndroidX) dependencies. If I had forgotten about something @lognaturel @seadowg please let me know but I guess we just missed it.\nHow does this change affect users? Describe intentional changes to behavior and behavior that could have accidentally been affected by code changes. In other words, what are the regression risks?\nIt would be good to check auto-send option for example to confirm that there is no regression.\nDo we need any specific form for testing your changes? If so, please attach one.\nNo.\nDoes this change require updates to documentation? If so, please file an issue here and include the link below.\nNo.\nBefore submitting this PR, please make sure you have:\n\n run ./gradlew checkAll and confirmed all checks still pass OR confirm CircleCI build passes and run ./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest locally.\n verified that any code or assets from external sources are properly credited in comments and/or in the about file.\n verified that any new UI elements use theme colors.
