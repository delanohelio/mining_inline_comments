Were any other approaches considered?\nInverted qr code it's not something common but if there is a request from a real user and we can do that why not?\nHow does this change affect users? Describe intentional changes to behavior and behavior that could have accidentally been affected by code changes. In other words, what are the regression risks?\nIt's not a risky change because it is related just to barcode widget and scanning setting. If we test those two functionalities everything should be fine.\nDo we need any specific form for testing your changes? If so, please attach one.\nAny form with barcode widget.\nDoes this change require updates to documentation? If so, please file an issue here and include the link below.\nNo.\nBefore submitting this PR, please make sure you have:\n\n run ./gradlew checkAll and confirmed all checks still pass OR confirm CircleCI build passes and run ./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest locally.\n verified that any code or assets from external sources are properly credited in comments and/or in the about file.\n verified that any new UI elements use theme colors.
