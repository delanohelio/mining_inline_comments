There is also a small tweak to fix the extra spacing in the audio controller.\nWhat has been done to verify that this works as intended?\nJust verified visually.\nWhy is this the best possible solution? Were any other approaches considered?\nNot a lot to discuss here. These are opinionated changes though so will understand if others want a less chunky waveform.\nHow does this change affect users? Describe intentional changes to behavior and behavior that could have accidentally been affected by code changes. In other words, what are the regression risks?\nThis can go in without QA (as long as at least one other person doesn't feel it makes anything look worse).\nBefore submitting this PR, please make sure you have:\n\n run ./gradlew checkAll and confirmed all checks still pass OR confirm CircleCI build passes and run ./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest locally.\n verified that any code or assets from external sources are properly credited in comments and/or in the about file.\n verified that any new UI elements use theme colors.
