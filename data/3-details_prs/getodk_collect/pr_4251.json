I also think we've had a hard time verifying that language is consistent and that there are no duplicates because this file has been so disorganized.\nI have loosely organized strings based on the UI but I wasn't religious about it. For certain things like geo features or the new audio work @seadowg has been working on I left strings grouped by feature. I think that as long as we have some organization that lets us relatively quickly find related strings it doesn't have to be perfect.\nSections are preceded by a comment block like this:\n    <!--\n     ##############################################\n     # SECTION NAME\n     ##############################################\n     -->\n\nI did it this way so it would stand out visually and would be easy to search. For example searching for \"# FILL\" gets you right to the \"Fill Blank Form\" section.\nThe sections are:\n\nFill blank form\nForm features\nGeo\nSend finalized form\nGet blank form\nDelete saved form\nGeneral settings\nAdmin settings\nGoogle Drive, Google Sheets\nAbout\nSettings import\nScoped Storage Migration\nMisc\n\nI also introduced line breaks between subgroups of related strings.\nThere were lots of changes I was tempted to make as I worked through this but I held back to hopefully make this not too controversial. I'll come back at the beginning of the next release cycle with some proposed wording changes.\nWhat has been done to verify that this works as intended?\nRan lint to make sure the expected number of translations are there. Ran on a real device to spot check the string consolidation done in later commits.\nWhy is this the best possible solution? Were any other approaches considered?\nI considered just adding the comments the forum poster had requested and moving on but this file has caused me enough pain that I wanted to take the time to clean it up some.\nI considered splitting the initial commit up but I decided it wasn't very important because if any strings had gone missing the code wouldn't compile. It's going to be nearly impossible to verify the strings.xml diff but I think that's ok.\nHow does this change affect users? Describe intentional changes to behavior and behavior that could have accidentally been affected by code changes. In other words, what are the regression risks?\nThe biggest risk I can think of is that I somehow accidentally deleted or broke some of the text. I think anything like that with common strings would be caught in the regression pass. I'm not sure we need to QA this.\nIf someone has an actively-maintained fork in which some text is modified, this will be annoying. But it's easier to deal with than many of the recent refactors. Additionally, no maintainers of forks have been active members of the community recently.\nDo we need any specific form for testing your changes? If so, please attach one.\nNo.\nDoes this change require updates to documentation? If so, please file an issue here and include the link below.\nI don't think it really needs an explicit mention in developer docs but let me know if you'd prefer it.\nBefore submitting this PR, please make sure you have:\n\n run ./gradlew checkAll and confirmed all checks still pass OR confirm CircleCI build passes and run ./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest locally.\n verified that any code or assets from external sources are properly credited in comments and/or in the about file.\n verified that any new UI elements use theme colors.
