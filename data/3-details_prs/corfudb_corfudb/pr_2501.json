CorfuTable that only uses a HashMap<> to represent the materialized view of a distributed map does not carry a notion of ordering natively. However when implemented over the abstraction of a distributed shared log, the elements added to the map do, in fact, have an ordering imposed by their append or transaction commit operations into the global log. The class `CorfuQueue` attempts to expose this inherent ordering as a persisted Queue with three simple apis:\n \n ###  1. `CorfuRecordId enqueue(E)`\n-Since a map has a key and value, where key is a conflict parameter, enqueue generates a non-conflicting Long as the key and inserts the Entry as a value into a CorfuTable. The generated Long is packed into the LSB of a UUID and returned to the caller as a CorfuRecordId. Note that this Id does not carry ordering since the operation could be part of a transaction that has not committed yet.\n+Since a map has a key and value, where key is a conflict parameter, enqueue generates a non-conflicting Long as the key and inserts the Entry as a value into a CorfuTable. If enqueue() is wrapped in a Corfu transaction this CorfuRecordId returned will capture the transaction's commit address and together with the entryId define the global cluster-wide order of the entry in the Queue.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "07d5cfadf63c214289170db060a7c512eabfa894"}, "originalPosition": 5}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "52c1207236b2b16bbb4989f8258dd38d7a0acd6e", "author": {"user": {"login": "hisundar", "name": "Sundar Sridharan"}}, "url": "https://github.com/CorfuDB/CorfuDB/commit/52c1207236b2b16bbb4989f8258dd38d7a0acd6e", "committedDate": "2020-04-06T17:12:59Z", "message": "CorfuQueue: Don't use epoch for ordering\n\nOrdering is whatever corfu transaction layer considers as ordering.\nSince epoch doesn't feature there, remove epoch from Queue.\nThis way if we epoch+sequence order ever diverges from sequence only\norder, the causality will be consistent with stream's causality.\n\nRemove UUID since that limits ability to pack larger structs in\nthe future.\nCorfuRecordId -> byte[] and back for opaque serialization.\nNote that comparator must still live within CorfuRecordId."}}, {"__typename": "HeadRefForcePushedEvent", "beforeCommit": {"oid": "07d5cfadf63c214289170db060a7c512eabfa894", "author": {"user": {"login": "hisundar", "name": "Sundar Sridharan"}}, "url": "https://github.com/CorfuDB/CorfuDB/commit/07d5cfadf63c214289170db060a7c512eabfa894", "committedDate": "2020-04-04T01:06:02Z", "message": "CorfuQueue: Don't use epoch for ordering\n\nOrdering is whatever corfu transaction layer considers as ordering.\nSince epoch doesn't feature there, remove epoch from Queue.\nThis way if we epoch+sequence order ever diverges from sequence only\norder, the causality will be consistent with stream's causality.\n\nCorfuRecordId -> byte[] and back for opaque serialization."}, "afterCommit": {"oid": "52c1207236b2b16bbb4989f8258dd38d7a0acd6e", "author": {"user": {"login": "hisundar", "name": "Sundar Sridharan"}}, "url": "https://github.com/CorfuDB/CorfuDB/commit/52c1207236b2b16bbb4989f8258dd38d7a0acd6e", "committedDate": "2020-04-06T17:12:59Z", "message": "CorfuQueue: Don't use epoch for ordering\n\nOrdering is whatever corfu transaction layer considers as ordering.\nSince epoch doesn't feature there, remove epoch from Queue.\nThis way if we epoch+sequence order ever diverges from sequence only\norder, the causality will be consistent with stream's causality.\n\nRemove UUID since that limits ability to pack larger structs in\nthe future.\nCorfuRecordId -> byte[] and back for opaque serialization.\nNote that comparator must still live within CorfuRecordId."}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Mzg4NDYyOTc3", "url": "https://github.com/CorfuDB/CorfuDB/pull/2501#pullrequestreview-388462977", "createdAt": "2020-04-06T17:24:21Z", "commit": {"oid": "52c1207236b2b16bbb4989f8258dd38d7a0acd6e"}, "state": "APPROVED", "comments": {"totalCount": 0, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": null, "endCursor": null, "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": []}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Mzg4Njc1NTM3", "url": "https://github.com/CorfuDB/CorfuDB/pull/2501#pullrequestreview-388675537", "createdAt": "2020-04-06T22:58:46Z", "commit": {"oid": "52c1207236b2b16bbb4989f8258dd38d7a0acd6e"}, "state": "APPROVED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNC0wNlQyMjo1ODo0NlrOGBs7pQ==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNC0wNlQyMjo1ODo0NlrOGBs7pQ==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwNDQzNzkyNQ==", "bodyText": "Complete Javadoc", "url": "https://github.com/CorfuDB/CorfuDB/pull/2501#discussion_r404437925", "createdAt": "2020-04-06T22:58:46Z", "author": {"login": "WenbinZhu"}, "path": "runtime/src/main/java/org/corfudb/runtime/collections/CorfuQueue.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -77,60 +77,58 @@ public int size() {\n     /**\n      * Each entry in the Queue is tagged with a unique Id.
