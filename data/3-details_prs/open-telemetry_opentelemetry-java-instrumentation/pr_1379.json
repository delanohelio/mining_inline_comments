The Muzzle will prevent loading an instrumentation\n-if the APIs do not match.\n+Muzzle is a safety feature of the Java agent that prevents applying instrumentation when a mismatch\n+between the instrumentation code and the instrumented application code is detected.\n+It ensures API compatibility between symbols (classes, methods, fields) on the application classpath\n+and references to those symbols made by instrumentation advices defined in the agent.\n+In other words, muzzle ensures that the API symbols used by the agent are compatible with the API\n+symbols on the application classpath.\n \n-## How does it work\n+Muzzle will prevent loading an instrumentation if it detects any mismatch or conflict.\n \n-At build time, for each instrumentation the Muzzle ByteBuddy plugin collects symbols referring to both internal\n-and 3rd party APIs used by the currently processed instrumentation. The reference collection process starts\n-from advice classes - values of the map returned by the `Instrumenter.Default#transformers()` method.\n+## How it works\n \n-All those references are then used to create a `ReferenceMatcher` instance.\n-The matcher is stored in the instrumentation class in method `ReferenceMatcher getInstrumentationMuzzle()`.\n+Muzzle has two phases:\n+* at compile time it collects references to the third-party symbols;\n+* at runtime it compares those references to the actual API symbols on the classpath.\n \n-At runtime the Muzzle checks API compatibility between symbols used by the Agent\n-and symbols in the application class loader. If the symbols do not match the instrumentation is not loaded.\n-Because the muzzle matcher is expensive, it is only performed after a match has been made by the\n-`SomeInstrumentation.classLoaderMatcher()` and `SomeInstrumentation.typeMatcher()` matchers.\n+### Compile-time reference collection\n+\n+The compile-time reference collection and code generation process is implemented using a ByteBuddy\n+plugin (called `MuzzleCodeGenerationPlugin`).\n+\n+For each instrumentation the ByteBuddy plugin collects symbols referring to both internal and third\n+party APIs used by the currently processed instrumentation. The reference collection process starts\n+from advice classes (values of the map returned by the `Instrumenter.Default#transformers()` method)\n+and traverses the class graph until it encounters a reference to a non-instrumentation class.\n+\n+All collected references are then used to create a `ReferenceMatcher` instance. This matcher\n+is stored in the instrumentation class in the method `Instrumenter.Default#getMuzzleReferenceMatcher()`.\n+The bytecode of this method (basically an array of `Reference` builder calls) is generated\n+automatically by the ByteBuddy plugin using an ASM code visitor.\n+\n+The source code of the compile-time plugin is located in the `javaagent-tooling` module,\n+package `io.opentelemetry.javaagent.tooling.muzzle.collector`.\n+\n+### Runtime reference matching\n+\n+The runtime reference matching process is implemented as a ByteBuddy matcher in `Instrumenter.Default`.\n+`MuzzleMatcher` uses the `getMuzzleReferenceMatcher()` method generated during the compilation phase\n+to verify that the class loader of the instrumented type has all necessary symbols (classes,\n+methods, fields). If the `ReferenceMatcher` finds any mismatch between collected references and the\n+actual application classpath types the whole instrumentation is discarded.\n+\n+It is worth noting that because the muzzle check is expensive, it is only performed after a match\n+has been made by the `InstrumenterDefault#classLoaderMatcher()` and `Instrumenter.Default#typeMatcher()`\n+matchers.\n+\n+The source code of the runtime muzzle matcher is located in the `javaagent-tooling` module,\n+class `Instrumenter.Default` and package `io.opentelemetry.javaagent.tooling.muzzle.matcher`.\n \n ## Muzzle gradle plugin\n \n-The `printReferences` task prints all API references in a given module.\n+The muzzle gradle plugin allows to perform the runtime reference matching process against different\n+third party library versions, when the project is built.\n \n-```bash\n-./gradlew :instrumentation:google-http-client-1.19:printReferences\n-```\n+Muzzle gradle plugin is just an additional utility for enhanced build-time checking.\n+**Even without using it muzzle reference matching is _always_ active in runtime**,\n+it's not an optional feature.\n+\n+The gradle plugin defines two tasks:\n+\n+* `printReferences` task prints all API references in a given module:\n+    ```sh\n+    ./gradlew :instrumentation:google-http-client-1.19:printReferences\n+    ```\n+\n+* `muzzle` task runs the runtime muzzle verification against different library versions:\n+    ```sh\n+    ./gradlew :instrumentation:google-http-client-1.19:muzzle\n+    ```\n+    If a new, incompatible version is published it fails the build.\n \n-The `muzzle` task downloads 3rd party libraries from maven central and checks API compatibility.\n-If a new incompatible version is published it fails the build.\n+The muzzle plugin needs to be configured in the module's `.gradle` file.\n+Example:\n \n-```bash\n-./gradlew :instrumentation:google-http-client-1.19:muzzle\n+```groovy\n+muzzle {\n+  // it is expected that muzzle fails the runtime check for this component\n+  fail {\n+    group = \"commons-httpclient\"\n+    module = \"commons-httpclient\"\n+    // versions from this range are checked\n+    versions = \"[,4.0)\"\n+    // this version is not checked by muzzle\n+    skipVersions += '3.1-jenkins-1'\n+  }\n+  // it is expected that muzzle passes the runtime check for this component\n+  pass {\n+    group = \"org.apache.httpcomponents\"\n+    module = \"httpclient\"\n+    versions = \"[4.0,)\"\n+    // verify that all other versions - [,4.0) in this case - fail the muzzle runtime check\n+    assertInverse = true\n+  }\n+  // ...\n+}\n ```\n \n-## Muzzle location\n+* Using either `pass` or `fail` directive allows to specify whether muzzle should treat the\n+  reference check failure as expected behavior;\n+* `versions` is a version range, where `[]` is inclusive and `()` is exclusive. It is not needed to\n+  specify the exact version to start/end, e.g. `[1.0.0,4)` would usually behave in the same way as\n+  `[1.0.0,4.0.0-Alpha)`;\n+* `assertInverse` is basically a shortcut for adding an opposite directive for all library versions\n+  that are not included in the specified `versions` range.\n \n-* `buildSrc` - Muzzle Gradle plugin\n-* `agent-tooling/src/main/java/io/opentelemetry/javaagent/tooling/muzzle` - Muzzle ByteBuddy plugin\n+The source code of the gradle plugin is located in the `buildSrd` directory.", "state": "SUBMITTED",
