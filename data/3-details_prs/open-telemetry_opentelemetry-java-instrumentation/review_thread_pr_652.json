Shaded during creation of `java-agent` jar file by Shadow\n Gradle plugin.\n \n+### Writing instrumentation\n+\n+**Warning**: The repository is still in the process of migrating to the structure described here.\n+\n+Any time we want to add OpenTelemetry support for a new Java library, e.g., so usage\n+of that library has tracing, we must write new instrumentation for that library. Let's\n+go over some terms first.\n+\n+**Manual Instrumentation**: This is logic that creates spans and enriches them with data\n+using library-specific monitoring APIs. For example, when instrumenting an RPC library,\n+the instrumentation will use some library-specific functionality to listen to events such\n+as the start and end of a request and will execute code to start and end spans in these\n+listeners. Many of these libraries will provide interception type APIs such as the gRPC\n+`ClientInterceptor` or servlet's `Filter`. Others will provide a Java interface whose methods\n+correspond to a request, and instrumentation can define an implementation which delegates\n+to the standard, wrapping methods with the logic to manage spans. Users will add code to their\n+apps that initialize the classes provided by manual instrumentation libraries and the libraries\n+can be found inside the user's app itself.\n+\n+Some libraries will have no way of intercepting requests because they only expose static APIs\n+and no interception hooks. For these libraries it is not possible to create manual\n+instrumentation.\n+\n+**Auto Instrumentation**: This is logic that is similar to manual instrumentation, but instead\n+of a user initializing classes themselves, a Java agent automatically initializes them during\n+class loading by manipulating byte code. This allows a user to develop their apps without thinking\n+about instrumentation and get it \"for free\". Often, the auto instrumentation will generate bytecode\n+that is more or less identical to what a user would have written themselves in their app.\n+\n+In addition to automatically initializing manual instrumentation, auto instrumentation can be used\n+for libraries where manual instrumentation is not possible, such as `URLConnection`, because it can\n+intercept even the JDK's classes. Such libraries will not have manual instrumentation but will have\n+auto instrumentation.\n+\n+#### Folder Structure\n+\n+When writing new instrumentation, create a new subfolder of `instrumentation` to correspond to the\n+instrumented library and the version being targeted. Ideally an old version of the library is\n+targeted in a way that the instrumentation applies to a large range of versions, but this may be\n+restricted by the interception APIs provided by the library.\n+\n+Within the subfolder, create three folders `library` (skip if manual instrumentation is not possible),\n+`agent`, and `testing`.\n+\n+For example, if we are targeting an RPC framework `yarpc` at version `1.0` we would have a tree like\n+\n+```\n+instrumentation ->\n+    ...\n+    yarpc-1.0 ->\n+        agent\n+            agent.gradle\n+        library\n+            library.gradle\n+        testing\n+            testing.gradle\n+```\n+\n+and in the top level `settings.gradle`\n+\n+```groovy\n+\n+include 'instrumentation:yarpc-1.0:agent'\n+include 'instrumentation:yarpc-1.0:library'\n+include 'instrumentation:yarpc-1.0:testing'\n+```\n+\n+#### Writing manual instrumentation\n+\n+Begin by writing the instrumentation for the library in `library`.
