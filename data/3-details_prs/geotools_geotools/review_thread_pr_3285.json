Also, the filter is best sent down to the data source.\nSo it should be merged with other filters coming from the current request, if possible. Thinking about a WFS/WMS case for example, say the WMS bbox and the intersects filter have a small intersection, working at the filter level would allow to load only the features in the intersection between the two, loading significantly less data. And if the intersection is empty, maybe don't load data at all.", "url": "https://github.com/geotools/geotools/pull/3285#discussion_r554077303", "createdAt": "2021-01-08T17:09:40Z", "author": {"login": "aaime"}, "path": "modules/library/main/src/main/java/org/geotools/feature/collection/ClipIntersectsFeatureCollection.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,80 @@\n+/*\n+ *    GeoTools - The Open Source Java GIS Toolkit\n+ *    http://geotools.org\n+ *\n+ *    (C) 2020, Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo)\n+ *\n+ *    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n+ *    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n+ *    License as published by the Free Software Foundation;\n+ *    version 2.1 of the License.\n+ *\n+ *    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n+ *    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n+ *    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
