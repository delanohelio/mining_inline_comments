In GMT or a +ive offset timezone (europe) it works.  This had to so with how geotools/sql lite interpret dates local-timezone vs UTC\n* use \"utc\" instead of \"localtime\" in GeoPkgFilterToSQL.java (sql lite \"datetime\" function)\nd) When adding testBetween_timestamp() test case, I noticed that sql lite was not doing \"as expected.\"  I switched so that it was doing everything in UTC.  This meant a change;\n* add \"Z\" to end of timestamp literals (or sql lite's \"datetime\" function will interpret it as local time)\nChecklist\n\nReviewing is a process done by project maintainers, mostly on a volunteer basis. We try to keep the overhead as small as possible and appreciate if you help us to do so by completing the following items. Feel free to ask in a comment if you have troubles with any of them.\n\nFor all pull requests:\n\n Confirm you have read the contribution guidelines\n You have sent a Contribution Licence Agreement (CLA) as necessary (not required for small changes, e.g., fixing typos in documentation)\n\ncovered by GeoCAT  CLA\n\n\n Make sure the first PR targets the master branch, eventual backports will be managed later. This can be ignored if the PR is fixing an issue that only happens in a specific branch, but not in newer ones.\n The changes are not breaking the build in downstream projects using SNAPSHOT dependencies, GeoWebCache and GeoServer.\n\nThe following are required only for core and extension modules (they are welcomed, but not required, for unsupported modules):\n\n There is an issue in Jira describing the bug/task/new feature (a notable exemptions is, changes not visible to end users). The ticket is for the GeoTools project, if the issue was found elsewhere it's a good practice to link to the origin ticket/issue.\n The pull request contains changes related to a single objective. If multiple focuses cannot be avoided, each one is in its own commit and has a separate ticket describing it.\n PR for bug fixes and small new features are presented as a single commit\n Commit message must be in the form \"[GEOT-XYZW] Title of the Jira ticket\"\n New unit tests have been added covering the changes\n This PR passes all existing unit tests (test results will be reported by travis-ci after opening this PR)\n This PR passes the QA checks (QA checks results will be reported by travis-ci after opening this PR)\n Documentation has been updated accordingly.\nN/A\n\nSubmitting the PR does not require you to check all items, but by the time it gets merged, they should be either satisfied or inapplicable.", "createdAt": "2020-03-09T20:45:07Z", "url": "https://github.com/geotools/geotools/pull/2834", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "1e8f596b64dd68b8bbd06e98b7fe5ce5489e2662"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-03-09T23:17:56Z", "author": {"login": "davidblasby"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 5, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABcMEB7bAH2gAyMzg1ODEwMDIxOjM4MzkwNTE2YzUxMWY1YjExNGYyZTA0Y2I2YjQ0NTlhMjE2MzJiYTQ=", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABcMEtrOgH2gAyMzg1ODEwMDIxOjcyYmRmNDAwZTMxMWFiN2FjZDkxMmMwY2IxZjNiYzI4NDQ5N2I2YjI=", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "38390516c511f5b114f2e04cb6b4459a21632ba4", "author": {"user": null}, "url": "https://github.com/geotools/geotools/commit/38390516c511f5b114f2e04cb6b4459a21632ba4", "committedDate": "2020-03-09T20:34:54Z", "message": "GEOT-6520 - use sql.Date/sql.Timestamp superclass, use utc everywhere (geopkg), add test cases"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3MzcxNTI5MDA1", "url": "https://github.com/geotools/geotools/pull/2834#pullrequestreview-371529005", "createdAt": "2020-03-09T21:06:15Z", "commit": {"oid": "38390516c511f5b114f2e04cb6b4459a21632ba4"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMy0wOVQyMTowNjoxNVrOFz5XdQ==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMy0wOVQyMTowNjoxNVrOFz5XdQ==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4OTk2MTU4OQ==", "bodyText": "That is part of the actual geopackage spec right?", "url": "https://github.com/geotools/geotools/pull/2834#discussion_r389961589", "createdAt": "2020-03-09T21:06:15Z", "author": {"login": "jodygarnett"}, "path": "modules/plugin/geopkg/src/main/java/org/geotools/geopkg/GeoPkgDialect.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -496,7 +496,9 @@ public void setValue(\n                 ps.setString(column, ((Time) value).toString());\n                 break;\n             case Types.TIMESTAMP:\n-                ps.setString(column, ((Timestamp) value).toString());\n+                //2020-02-19 23:00:00.0  --> 2020-02-19 23:00:00.0Z\n+                //We need the \"Z\" or sql lite will interpret the value as local time\n+                ps.setString(column, ((Timestamp) value).toString()+\"Z\");", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "38390516c511f5b114f2e04cb6b4459a21632ba4"}, "originalPosition": 7}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3MzcxNTMxNTg3", "url": "https://github.com/geotools/geotools/pull/2834#pullrequestreview-371531587", "createdAt": "2020-03-09T21:10:39Z", "commit": {"oid": "38390516c511f5b114f2e04cb6b4459a21632ba4"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMy0wOVQyMToxMDozOVrOFz5fng==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMy0wOVQyMToxMDozOVrOFz5fng==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4OTk2MzY3OA==", "bodyText": "This check looked kind of odd when I first saw it;
