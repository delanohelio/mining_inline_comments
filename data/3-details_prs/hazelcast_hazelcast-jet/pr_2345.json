For the\n+low-latency benchmarks we chose the JDK 14 as the most recent stable\n+version and three of its garbage collectors: Shenandoah, ZGC, and G1 GC.\n+\n+Our finding that Shenandoah apparently fared worse than the other GCs\n+attracted some reactions, most notably from the Shenandoah team who\n+reproduced our finding, created an\n+[issue](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8247358), came up with\n+a fix, and committed it to the jdk/jdk16 repository, all in the span of\n+a few days. The change pertains to the heuristics that decide how much\n+work the GC should do in the background in order to exactly match the\n+applications allocation rate. This component is called the _pacer_. It\n+was constantly detecting it's falling behind the application and going\n+into a brief \"panic mode\" in order to catch up. The fix fine-tunes the\n+pacer's heuristics.\n+\n+Given this quick development, we wanted to test out the effects of the\n+fix, but also take the opportunity to zoom in on the low-latency\n+streaming case and make a more detailed analysis.\n+\n+## The JDK We Tested\n+\n+Since this is all so fresh, we couldn't use an existing JDK release, not\n+even EA, to see the effects of the fix. JDK version 14.0.2 is slated to\n+be released on July 14. To nevertheless make progress, we took the\n+source code from the jdk14u tree, at the changeset number\n+[57869:e9d41bbaea38](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk-updates/jdk14u/rev/e9d41bbaea38),\n+and applied the changeset number\n+[59746:29b4bb22b5e2](https://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk/jdk/rev/29b4bb22b5e2)\n+from the main jdk tree on top of it. The jdk14u tree is where JDK 14.0.2\n+will be released from and the changeset 59746:29b4bb22b5e2 applies the\n+patch resolving the mentioned Shenandoah issue.\n+\n+`-XX:-UseBiasedLocking`", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "6d485dde38b2d39cc0183d88219150c4e0ac03bb"}, "originalPosition": 50}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "66d80c8815bc1a656746e05aed9b47a24c444335", "author": {"user": {"login": "mtopolnik", "name": "Marko Topolnik"}}, "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/commit/66d80c8815bc1a656746e05aed9b47a24c444335", "committedDate": "2020-06-22T05:20:54Z", "message": "Discuss JVM options"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "ce0e03762b3e38589a3b32e99736513c349c0792", "author": {"user": {"login": "mtopolnik", "name": "Marko Topolnik"}}, "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/commit/ce0e03762b3e38589a3b32e99736513c349c0792", "committedDate": "2020-06-22T08:52:38Z", "message": "More content, updated images"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "278b12f3dd8858780d6dfea7264e47bf2a33bc0d", "author": {"user": {"login": "mtopolnik", "name": "Marko Topolnik"}}, "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/commit/278b12f3dd8858780d6dfea7264e47bf2a33bc0d", "committedDate": "2020-06-22T09:33:53Z", "message": "Update wording, charts"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "527b52eea4cf994d6a5b03a10c16c8ba03e9e598", "author": {"user": {"login": "mtopolnik", "name": "Marko Topolnik"}}, "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/commit/527b52eea4cf994d6a5b03a10c16c8ba03e9e598", "committedDate": "2020-06-22T18:07:06Z", "message": "Touchups, more links"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "90ce98e147f487a5c5973a1f6b00348d65efa64b", "author": {"user": {"login": "mtopolnik", "name": "Marko Topolnik"}}, "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/commit/90ce98e147f487a5c5973a1f6b00348d65efa64b", "committedDate": "2020-06-22T18:15:23Z", "message": "Adjust post date, add cross-links"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "7a8e1fb640c69616343f85261fb2292dccff77cc", "author": {"user": {"login": "mtopolnik", "name": "Marko Topolnik"}}, "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/commit/7a8e1fb640c69616343f85261fb2292dccff77cc", "committedDate": "2020-06-22T18:26:02Z", "message": "Use Twitter URL"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "f4e2880ca8301534da9906058c973e213d996ebe", "author": {"user": {"login": "mtopolnik", "name": "Marko Topolnik"}}, "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/commit/f4e2880ca8301534da9906058c973e213d996ebe", "committedDate": "2020-06-22T18:33:50Z", "message": "Touchup wording"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "d47c237fd31105fb072ac38bd62ce64d3cf028aa", "author": {"user": {"login": "mtopolnik", "name": "Marko Topolnik"}}, "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/commit/d47c237fd31105fb072ac38bd62ce64d3cf028aa", "committedDate": "2020-06-23T09:16:49Z", "message": "Update content, wider throughput range"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "182fcd64a4fc5448c2af7a9cb46f96e05c9e5784", "author": {"user": {"login": "mtopolnik", "name": "Marko Topolnik"}}, "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/commit/182fcd64a4fc5448c2af7a9cb46f96e05c9e5784", "committedDate": "2020-06-23T09:17:04Z", "message": "Update GC Concerns on Operations Guide"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "26dabc191ac5f24d5579e66c68b95202507daf82", "author": {"user": {"login": "mtopolnik", "name": "Marko Topolnik"}}, "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/commit/26dabc191ac5f24d5579e66c68b95202507daf82", "committedDate": "2020-06-23T09:23:09Z", "message": "Touchup wording"}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 3678, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-01T14:51:55Z"}}}
