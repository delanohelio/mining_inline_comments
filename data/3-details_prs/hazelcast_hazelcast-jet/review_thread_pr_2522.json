We decide which one to use, according to the definition of the\n+associated part of the pipeline.\n+\n+The main tradeoff we need to consider when creating this design is\n+allowing event reordering vs performance.\n+\n+### Prevention of Event Reordering\n+\n+When distributing events from a one node to multiple nodes, events get\n+out-of-order. If we especially avoid this situation that breaks the\n+order in the pipeline, the order of events will be preserved. But, this\n+comes with the loss of parallelism: The maximum number of nodes in one\n+stage is restricted by the predecessor stage (LP of the stage <= LP of\n+the previous stage). Applying this for the entire pipeline may not\n+always be feasible. E.g. If any stage of the pipeline contains only a\n+single node (LP=1), following stages have to contain a single node,\n+which is a suboptimal utilization of parallelism.\n+\n+### Implementation Details\n+\n+In order to prevent the order of events from changing, we avoid the use\n+of round-robin edge. The common pattern we've implemented in most\n+transforms to achieve this described below.\n+\n+If a transform does not use partitioned edge:\n+\n+- Ensure that the LP of the input vertex of the transform is equal to\n+  the PlannerVertex of the upstream transform.\n+- Connect these transform vertices with isolated edge.\n+\n+Otherwise:\n+\n+- do not change the properties of the transform if it already uses\n+  partitioned edge.\n+\n+To ensure such LP equality between transforms, we had to specify LP's in\n+job planning (pipeline.toDag()) stage. After that, we did this by\n+modifying pipeline stages (transforms) one-by-one.
