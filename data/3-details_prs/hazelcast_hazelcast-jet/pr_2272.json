combination is important.\n+---\n+\n+With the introduction of the modern, fast-paced JDK release schedule the\n+JVM landscape has undergone a phase change. In May 2020 we did an\n+extensive test with various combinations of old and new JDK/GC\n+combinations and we bring you the most important conclusions that should\n+impact your Hazelcast Jet setup:\n+\n+1. As far as Hazelcast Jet is concerned, JDK version 8 is an antiquated\n+   runtime and shouldn't be used. None of its garbage collectors have\n+   satisfactory performance and their long GC pauses even result in\n+   nodes being kicked out of the cluster.\n+2. JDK 11 is the current Long-Term Support (LTS) version by Oracle and\n+   it is the lowest version of JDK we recommend. We found that its\n+   version of the G1, without any fine-tuning, already delivers\n+   next-generation GC performance. The default maximum GC pause target\n+   is 200 ms, which it meets in a very broad range of scenarios. By\n+   configuring a single JVM option (`-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis`), you can\n+   confine the maximum GC pause to 20-25 ms, which it can maintain at\n+   lower GC pressure levels.\n+4. There are two more GCs that are relevant, but as of this writing are\n+   in the experimental phase. They are the low-latency collectors:\n+   Oracle's Z and OpenJDK's Shenandoah. Testing on JDK 14, we found Z to\n+   be the better of the two and a viable replacement for G1 in scenarios\n+   that have low GC pressure, but very strict GC pause requirements. Z\n+   was able to keep the maximum pause within 10 milliseconds. Since the\n+   Z is available in OpenJDK as well, we recommend it for scenarios\n+   where G1's GC pauses are too long. The version of Z in JDK 14 has\n+   crude ergonomics to decide on a good background GC thread count, in\n+   some cases you can improve the throughput by using\n+   `-XX:ConcGCThreads`.\n+\n+Here are some more details, organized by the type of workload you are\n+using Jet for.\n+\n+## Moderate State, Low-Latency Stream Processing", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "92121960695006f2a9cbcd3a7d3e3231d5a4395c"}, "originalPosition": 39}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "86b16a81b252b2d44e1fe053f0458f36f796d306", "author": {"user": {"login": "mtopolnik", "name": "Marko Topolnik"}}, "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/commit/86b16a81b252b2d44e1fe053f0458f36f796d306", "committedDate": "2020-06-08T06:24:02Z", "message": "Touchups"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "985c81dcdb9b6045e08d5e248f55b38277082ff2", "author": {"user": {"login": "mtopolnik", "name": "Marko Topolnik"}}, "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/commit/985c81dcdb9b6045e08d5e248f55b38277082ff2", "committedDate": "2020-06-08T09:57:34Z", "message": "Change date of blog"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "17cef6e814d498365c16127499dbde45c31a4f09", "author": {"user": {"login": "mtopolnik", "name": "Marko Topolnik"}}, "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/commit/17cef6e814d498365c16127499dbde45c31a4f09", "committedDate": "2020-06-08T11:10:05Z", "message": "Touchups"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "196fd6ca5f57608a949d48fce292f46744fde8d4", "author": {"user": {"login": "mtopolnik", "name": "Marko Topolnik"}}, "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/commit/196fd6ca5f57608a949d48fce292f46744fde8d4", "committedDate": "2020-06-08T14:03:38Z", "message": "Remove Operations Guide"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDI2ODg1NDYw", "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/2272#pullrequestreview-426885460", "createdAt": "2020-06-09T08:04:53Z", "commit": {"oid": "196fd6ca5f57608a949d48fce292f46744fde8d4"}, "state": "APPROVED", "comments": {"totalCount": 0, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": null, "endCursor": null, "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": []}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 3810, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-01T14:51:55Z"}}}
