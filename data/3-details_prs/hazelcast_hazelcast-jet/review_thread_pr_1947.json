For details see the\n+https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/rn/index.html#4-0[IMDG Release Notes].\n+The most obvious change is that many classes that used to be in the\n+general `com.hazelcast.core` package are now in specific packages like\n+`com.hazelcast.map` or `com.hazelcast.collection`.\n+\n+* We moved the serializable variants of `java.util.function` interfaces\n+from `com.hazelcast.jet.function` to `com.hazelcast.function`:\n+`BiConsumerEx`,`BiFunctionEx`,`BinaryOperatorEx`, `BiPredicateEx`,\n+`ComparatorEx`, `ComparatorsEx`, `ConsumerEx`, `FunctionEx`, `Functions`,\n+`PredicateEx`, `SupplierEx`, `ToDoubleFunctionEx`, `ToIntFunctionEx`,\n+`ToLongFunctionEx`.\n+\n+* We updated/fixed the type parameters on several methods and classes, for\n+example the `EntryProcessor`. See the\n+https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/#introducing-lambda-friendly-interfaces[relevant section]\n+in the IMDG Migration Guide.\n+\n+* We changed the usage of the term \"group\" in configuration to \"cluster\".\n+See the code snippet below for an example.

It now takes a `ProcessorSupplier.Context`\n+instead of just `JetInstance`. We also added convenience methods in\n+`ServiceFactories` to simplify constructing the common variants:\n++\n+[source]\n+----\n+include::{javasource}/migration/Migration.java[tag=serviceFactory1]\n+----\n+\n+* We renamed `map/filter/flatMapUsingContext` to\n+`map/filter/flatMapUsingService`.\n++\n+[source]\n+----\n+include::{javasource}/migration/Migration.java[tag=pipeline2]\n+----\n+\n+* We removed the methods `withMaxPendingCallsPerProcessor(int)` and\n+`withUnorderedAsyncResponses()` from `ServiceFactory`. These properties\n+are relevant only in the context of asynchronous operations and were used\n+in conjunction with `GeneralStage.mapUsingServiceAsync(...)`. In Jet 4.0\n+the `GeneralStage.mapUsingServiceAsync(...)` method has a new variant with\n+explicit parameters for the above settings.\n++", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3ODI1ODI1NA=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "1ea9e5a4419a04de54f7bb9030d6a31619a918e8"}, "originalPosition": 136}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMjM0MDIzNzAzOnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "reference-manual/src/main/asciidoc/appendix.adoc", "isResolved": true, "comments": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMi0xMlQxMzo0NjoyMVrOFovFfA==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMi0xMlQxNToxNDo0MVrOFoygVQ==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3ODI1ODgxMg==", "bodyText": "Pipeline.drawFrom -> Pipeline.readFrom and GeneralStage.drainTo -> GeneralStage.writeTo", "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/1947#discussion_r378258812", "createdAt": "2020-02-12T13:46:21Z", "author": {"login": "cangencer"}, "path": "reference-manual/src/main/asciidoc/appendix.adoc", "diffHunk": "@@ -283,6 +284,158 @@ The URL used for phone home requests is\n http://phonehome.hazelcast.com/ping\n ----\n \n+[appendix]\n+= Migration Guides\n+\n+This appendix provides guidelines for upgrading to a new Hazelcast Jet\n+version.
