We will use Hazelcast Jet\n+image as base image and create an image with hello world job. You can\n+use the same approach to package any job.\n+\n+Create a file called `Dockerfile` in the <jet home> directory.\n+\n+```text\n+FROM hazelcast/hazelcast-jet\n+\n+ADD examples/hello-world.jar /examples/\n+\n+ENV ADDRESSES 172.17.0.2\n+\n+CMD [\"sh\", \"-c\", \"jet -a $ADDRESSES submit /examples/hello-world.jar\"]\n+```\n+\n+The first line specifies `hazelcast/hazelcast-jet` image as base image.\n+The `ADD` command copies the `hello-world.jar` to the `/examples`\n+directory inside the container image. `ENV` command defines an\n+environment variable `ADDRESSES` with default value of `172.17.0.2`.\n+This can be overriden via `-e` parameter of the `docker run`\n+command. The `CMD` command specifies what command to run.\n+\n+Then create the image by running the following command:\n+\n+```bash\n+docker build . -t hazelcast-jet-hello-world\n+```\n+\n+You should see output similar to this:\n+\n+```text\n+Sending build context to Docker daemon  77.35MB\n+Step 1/4 : FROM hazelcast/hazelcast-jet:{jet-version}\n+ ---> c126c24c3d0b\n+Step 2/4 : ADD examples/hello-world.jar /examples/\n+ ---> Using cache\n+ ---> 2e3fa98d0c7e\n+Step 3/4 : ENV ADDRESSES 172.17.0.2\n+ ---> Using cache\n+ ---> f96d01158d6e\n+Step 4/4 : CMD [\"sh\", \"-c\", \"jet -a $ADDRESSES submit /examples/hello-world.jar\"]\n+ ---> Using cache\n+ ---> 6bc0f527b69c\n+Successfully built 6bc0f527b69c\n+Successfully tagged hazelcast-jet-hello-world:latest\n+```\n+\n+Now you can submit the job by creating a container from the newly built\n+image:\n+\n+```bash\n+docker run -it hazelcast-jet-hello-world\n+```\n+\n+> You don't need the `-it` parameters if your job class exits after\n+> the jobs is submitted", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "f84e2b64522c5dea31e26c31ac93d8bd40144f4c"}, "originalPosition": 340}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMjY5MjgxMzM0OnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "site/website/versioned_docs/version-4.1/operations/docker.md", "isResolved": false, "comments": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNS0yOVQwODo0MTozMVrOGcT_Zw==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNS0yOVQxMToyODowNlrOGcY90Q==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzMjM0MDgzOQ==", "bodyText": "Notice the above comments for this document, too.", "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/2263#discussion_r432340839", "createdAt": "2020-05-29T08:41:31Z", "author": {"login": "Serdaro"}, "path": "site/website/versioned_docs/version-4.1/operations/docker.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,349 @@\n+---\n+title: Hazelcast Jet with Docker\n+description: How to use Jet in a Docker environment\n+id: version-4.1-docker\n+original_id: docker\n+---\n+", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "f84e2b64522c5dea31e26c31ac93d8bd40144f4c"}, "originalPosition": 7}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzMjQyMjM1Mw==", "bodyText": "Made same changes to both docs.", "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/2263#discussion_r432422353", "createdAt": "2020-05-29T11:28:06Z", "author": {"login": "frant-hartm"}, "path": "site/website/versioned_docs/version-4.1/operations/docker.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,349 @@\n+---\n+title: Hazelcast Jet with Docker\n+description: How to use Jet in a Docker environment\n+id: version-4.1-docker\n+original_id: docker\n+---\n+", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzMjM0MDgzOQ=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "f84e2b64522c5dea31e26c31ac93d8bd40144f4c"}, "originalPosition": 7}]}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 4723, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-12T20:44:06Z"}}}
