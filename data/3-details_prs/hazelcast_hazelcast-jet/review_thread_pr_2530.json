We want to measure both the performance impact of enabling\n+CDC on specific databases and the event throughput. This work is still\n+ongoing, we still have to publish our exact testing methodology, but the\n+results obtained so far are available [here](https://jet-start.sh/docs/next/design-docs/005-cdc-sources#performance).\n+\n+## Architecture\n+\n+I have stated above that when Debezium is integrated into Jet, the\n+latter takes on the role of service-provider as far as fault tolerance\n+and scalability are concerned.\n+\n+Jet doesn't delegate its cluster management and fault tolerance concerns\n+to an outside system like ZooKeeper. It reuses the groundwork\n+implemented for Hazelcast IMDG: cluster management and the IMap, and\n+adds its own implementation of Chandy-Lamport distributed snapshots. If\n+a cluster member fails, Jet will restart the job on the remaining\n+members, restore the state of processing from the last snapshot, and\n+then seamlessly continue from that point. For further details, consult\n+our [documentation on the\n+topic](https://jet-start.sh/docs/next/architecture/fault-tolerance).\n+\n+Extending this functionality umbrella to cover Debezium has been\n+surprisingly simple. All that was really needed was to add Debezium\u2019s\n+source offset to Jet\u2019s snapshots. This way, whenever Jet needs to\n+execute a recovery, it can also pass the recovered offset to Debezium,\n+which in turn is able to resume the data flow from that offset.\n+\n+One other thing we did and might be worth mentioning is that the Jet\n+integration also makes use of Debezium\u2019s [new record state\n+extraction](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/1.2/configuration/event-flattening.html)\n+SMT (Simple Message Transformation), for the purpose of message\n+structure simplification. With this transformation in effect, only the\n+\"after\" structure of the Debezium event envelope is processed by Jet.\n+However, whether this is a good idea or not, only time will tell.

It becomes possible to safely\n+extend old systems with all kinds of new functionality: real-time\n+analytics, complex event processing, anomaly & fraud detection and so\n+on.\n+\n+## Integration\n+\n+When we first considered integrating Debezium into Jet, the most\n+important decisions were centered around the fact that Debezium is\n+designed to be deployed via Apache [Kafka\n+Connect](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect), which then\n+takes care of *fault tolerance* and *scalability*. Fortunately, Jet is\n+fully capable of providing these crucial services. Also, Kafka Connect\n+is a good enough abstraction that we were able to mimic it for Debezium.\n+\n+We are aware that Debezium also offers an *embedded mode* for\n+applications not interested in fault-tolerance guarantees such as\n+exactly-once processing and resilience, but since Jet does not have a\n+\u201cdumbed down\u201dversion (even as full-blown is light enough to be\n+embedded), we quickly discarded this approach.\n+\n+So, first, we added generic support for Kafka Connect sources to Jet,\n+which should be a valuable feature even outside the scope of CDC. Then\n+we\u2019ve used Debezium to build a Kafka Connect source for Jet. Well\u2026\n+\u201cbuild\u201d might be overstating it. Debezium already is a Kafka Connect\n+source. We just had to make sure that Jet\u2019s specific fault-tolerance\n+mechanisms will interact with it properly, through the Kafka Connect\n+API.\n+\n+## Synergy\n+\n+One immediate benefit that Jet offers to Debezium users is eliminating\n+the need for *external services*. No Zookeeper, no Kafka needed. When\n+using Debezium through Jet, the latter takes care of the whole lifecycle\n+and fault tolerance of all the components involved. The setup is greatly\n+simplified.\n+\n+Then, obviously, there is the *stream processing capability*, because\n+that\u2019s what Jet does. Not only do you get access to the data, but you\n+also have the toolbox to process it, extract whatever insights you need\n+from it.\n+\n+In addition, Jet also aims to offer *further convenience* wrappers when\n+the Debezium source is being used. For example:\n+\n+* builders for the most common configuration properties to make setting\n+  up Debezium for some specific DB as simple as possible\n+* standard Java interfaces to give structure to the complex Debezium\n+  events\n+* JSON parsing, including mapping to Objects, based on [Jackson\n+  jr](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-jr), to simplify how parts\n+  of- or even entire Debezium events can be interpreted\n+\n+For an example look at this sample from our [CDC\n+tutorial](https://jet-start.sh/docs/tutorials/cdc#6-define-jet-job).

Jet stores\n+computational state in [fault-tolerant, distributed in-memory\n+storage](https://jet-start.sh/docs/api/data-structures), allowing\n+thousands of concurrent users granular and fast access to your data\n+without breaking a sweat.\n+\n+While stream processing is a natural solution for providing insight into\n+many big-data workloads, it\u2019s a relatively new evolution over its\n+predecessor - offline batch processing. Utilizing stream processing\n+effectively requires re-architecting existing systems to event-driven\n+architectures and introducing several new components. This process is\n+not always straightforward and also requires a shift in mindset.\n+\n+In this context, the functionality provided by change data capture\n+technologies, for which Debezium is one of the, if not THE best\n+open-source alternative, is a godsend. To be able to ingest data from\n+relational databases, without affecting the applications that use them,\n+changes the game for streaming systems. It becomes possible to safely\n+extend old systems with all kinds of new functionality: real-time\n+analytics, complex event processing, anomaly & fraud detection and so\n+on.\n+\n+## Integration\n+\n+When we first considered integrating Debezium into Jet, the most\n+important decisions were centered around the fact that Debezium is\n+designed to be deployed via Apache [Kafka\n+Connect](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect), which then\n+takes care of *fault tolerance* and *scalability*. Fortunately, Jet is\n+fully capable of providing these crucial services. Also, Kafka Connect\n+is a good enough abstraction that we were able to mimic it for Debezium.\n+\n+We are aware that Debezium also offers an *embedded mode* for\n+applications not interested in fault-tolerance guarantees such as\n+exactly-once processing and resilience, but since Jet does not have a\n+\u201cdumbed down\u201dversion (even as full-blown is light enough to be\n+embedded), we quickly discarded this approach.\n+\n+So, first, we added generic support for Kafka Connect sources to Jet,\n+which should be a valuable feature even outside the scope of CDC. Then\n+we\u2019ve used Debezium to build a Kafka Connect source for Jet. Well\u2026\n+\u201cbuild\u201d might be overstating it. Debezium already is a Kafka Connect\n+source. We just had to make sure that Jet\u2019s specific fault-tolerance\n+mechanisms will interact with it properly, through the Kafka Connect\n+API.\n+\n+## Synergy\n+\n+One immediate benefit that Jet offers to Debezium users is eliminating\n+the need for *external services*. No Zookeeper, no Kafka needed. When\n+using Debezium through Jet, the latter takes care of the whole lifecycle\n+and fault tolerance of all the components involved. The setup is greatly\n+simplified.\n+\n+Then, obviously, there is the *stream processing capability*, because\n+that\u2019s what Jet does. Not only do you get access to the data, but you\n+also have the toolbox to process it, extract whatever insights you need\n+from it.\n+\n+In addition, Jet also aims to offer *further convenience* wrappers when\n+the Debezium source is being used. For example:\n+\n+* builders for the most common configuration properties to make setting\n+  up Debezium for some specific DB as simple as possible\n+* standard Java interfaces to give structure to the complex Debezium\n+  events\n+* JSON parsing, including mapping to Objects, based on [Jackson\n+  jr](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-jr), to simplify how parts\n+  of- or even entire Debezium events can be interpreted\n+\n+For an example look at this sample from our [CDC\n+tutorial](https://jet-start.sh/docs/tutorials/cdc#6-define-jet-job). All\n+the code you would need to build an in-memory replica of your MySQL\n+database table would be something like:\n+\n+```java\n+StreamSource<ChangeRecord> source = MySqlCdcSources.mysql(\"source\")\n+        .setDatabaseAddress(\"127.0.0.1\")\n+        .setDatabasePort(3306)\n+        .setDatabaseUser(\"debezium\")\n+        .setDatabasePassword(\"dbz\")\n+        .setClusterName(\"dbserver1\")\n+        .setDatabaseWhitelist(\"inventory\")\n+        .setTableWhitelist(\"inventory.customers\")\n+        .build();\n+\n+Pipeline pipeline = Pipeline.create();\n+pipeline.readFrom(source)\n+        .withoutTimestamps()\n+        .peek()\n+        .writeTo(CdcSinks.map(\"customers\",\n+                r -> r.key().toMap().get(\"id\"),\n+                r -> r.value().toObject(Customer.class).toString()));\n+\n+JobConfig cfg = new JobConfig().setName(\"mysql-monitor\");\n+Jet.bootstrappedInstance().newJob(pipeline, cfg);\n+```\n+\n+One last service that Jet aims to add to Debezium\u2019s value is performance\n+benchmarks. We want to measure both the performance impact of enabling\n+CDC on specific databases and the event throughput. This work is still\n+ongoing, we still have to publish our exact testing methodology, but the\n+results obtained so far are available [here](https://jet-start.sh/docs/next/design-docs/005-cdc-sources#performance).\n+\n+## Architecture\n+\n+I have stated above that when Debezium is integrated into Jet, the\n+latter takes on the role of service-provider as far as fault tolerance\n+and scalability are concerned.\n+\n+Jet doesn't delegate its cluster management and fault tolerance concerns\n+to an outside system like ZooKeeper. It reuses the groundwork\n+implemented for Hazelcast IMDG: cluster management and the IMap, and\n+adds its own implementation of Chandy-Lamport distributed snapshots. If\n+a cluster member fails, Jet will restart the job on the remaining\n+members, restore the state of processing from the last snapshot, and\n+then seamlessly continue from that point. For further details, consult\n+our [documentation on the\n+topic](https://jet-start.sh/docs/next/architecture/fault-tolerance).\n+\n+Extending this functionality umbrella to cover Debezium has been\n+surprisingly simple. All that was really needed was to add Debezium\u2019s\n+source offset to Jet\u2019s snapshots. This way, whenever Jet needs to\n+execute a recovery, it can also pass the recovered offset to Debezium,\n+which in turn is able to resume the data flow from that offset.\n+\n+One other thing we did and might be worth mentioning is that the Jet\n+integration also makes use of Debezium\u2019s [new record state\n+extraction](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/1.2/configuration/event-flattening.html)\n+SMT (Simple Message Transformation), for the purpose of message\n+structure simplification. With this transformation in effect, only the\n+\"after\" structure of the Debezium event envelope is processed by Jet.\n+However, whether this is a good idea or not, only time will tell.

Jet stores\n+computational state in [fault-tolerant, distributed in-memory\n+storage](https://jet-start.sh/docs/api/data-structures), allowing\n+thousands of concurrent users granular and fast access to your data\n+without breaking a sweat.\n+\n+While stream processing is a natural solution for providing insight into\n+many big-data workloads, it\u2019s a relatively new evolution over its\n+predecessor - offline batch processing. Utilizing stream processing\n+effectively requires re-architecting existing systems to event-driven\n+architectures and introducing several new components. This process is\n+not always straightforward and also requires a shift in mindset.\n+\n+In this context, the functionality provided by change data capture\n+technologies, for which Debezium is one of the, if not THE best\n+open-source alternative, is a godsend. To be able to ingest data from\n+relational databases, without affecting the applications that use them,\n+changes the game for streaming systems. It becomes possible to safely\n+extend old systems with all kinds of new functionality: real-time\n+analytics, complex event processing, anomaly & fraud detection and so\n+on.\n+\n+## Integration\n+\n+When we first considered integrating Debezium into Jet, the most\n+important decisions were centered around the fact that Debezium is\n+designed to be deployed via Apache [Kafka\n+Connect](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect), which then\n+takes care of *fault tolerance* and *scalability*. Fortunately, Jet is\n+fully capable of providing these crucial services. Also, Kafka Connect\n+is a good enough abstraction that we were able to mimic it for Debezium.\n+\n+We are aware that Debezium also offers an *embedded mode* for\n+applications not interested in fault-tolerance guarantees such as\n+exactly-once processing and resilience, but since Jet does not have a\n+\u201cdumbed down\u201dversion (even as full-blown is light enough to be\n+embedded), we quickly discarded this approach.\n+\n+So, first, we added generic support for Kafka Connect sources to Jet,\n+which should be a valuable feature even outside the scope of CDC. Then\n+we\u2019ve used Debezium to build a Kafka Connect source for Jet. Well\u2026\n+\u201cbuild\u201d might be overstating it. Debezium already is a Kafka Connect\n+source. We just had to make sure that Jet\u2019s specific fault-tolerance\n+mechanisms will interact with it properly, through the Kafka Connect\n+API.\n+\n+## Synergy\n+\n+One immediate benefit that Jet offers to Debezium users is eliminating\n+the need for *external services*. No Zookeeper, no Kafka needed. When\n+using Debezium through Jet, the latter takes care of the whole lifecycle\n+and fault tolerance of all the components involved. The setup is greatly\n+simplified.\n+\n+Then, obviously, there is the *stream processing capability*, because\n+that\u2019s what Jet does. Not only do you get access to the data, but you\n+also have the toolbox to process it, extract whatever insights you need\n+from it.\n+\n+In addition, Jet also aims to offer *further convenience* wrappers when\n+the Debezium source is being used. For example:\n+\n+* builders for the most common configuration properties to make setting\n+  up Debezium for some specific DB as simple as possible\n+* standard Java interfaces to give structure to the complex Debezium\n+  events\n+* JSON parsing, including mapping to Objects, based on [Jackson\n+  jr](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-jr), to simplify how parts\n+  of - or even entire Debezium events can be interpreted\n+\n+For an example look at this sample from our [CDC\n+tutorial](https://jet-start.sh/docs/tutorials/cdc#6-define-jet-job). All\n+the code you would need to build an in-memory replica of your MySQL\n+database table would be something like:\n+\n+```java\n+StreamSource<ChangeRecord> source = MySqlCdcSources.mysql(\"source\")\n+        .setDatabaseAddress(\"127.0.0.1\")\n+        .setDatabasePort(3306)\n+        .setDatabaseUser(\"debezium\")\n+        .setDatabasePassword(\"dbz\")\n+        .setClusterName(\"dbserver1\")\n+        .setDatabaseWhitelist(\"inventory\")\n+        .setTableWhitelist(\"inventory.customers\")\n+        .build();\n+\n+Pipeline pipeline = Pipeline.create();\n+pipeline.readFrom(source)\n+        .withoutTimestamps()\n+        .peek()\n+        .writeTo(CdcSinks.map(\"customers\",\n+                r -> r.key().toMap().get(\"id\"),\n+                r -> r.value().toObject(Customer.class).toString()));\n+\n+JobConfig cfg = new JobConfig().setName(\"mysql-monitor\");\n+Jet.bootstrappedInstance().newJob(pipeline, cfg);\n+```\n+\n+One last service that Jet aims to add to Debezium\u2019s value is performance\n+benchmarks.
