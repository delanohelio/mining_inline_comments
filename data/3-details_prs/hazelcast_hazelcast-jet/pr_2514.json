If the events are sparse, time will effectively stop until a\n+newer event arrives. This causes high latency for time-sensitive\n+operations such as window aggregation. In addition, Jet tracks event\n+time for every source partition separately, and if just one partition\n+has sparse events, time progress in the whole job is hindered.\n+\n+## Ingestion Time\n+\n+When you use `withIngestionTime()` on the pipeline, Jet won't extract\n+the timestamp from the event, but will set it according to the local\n+system time on the server. This way of assigning timestamps is inferior\n+because the event isn't associated with the time at which it occurred,\n+but at which Jet received it, causing inaccuracy in the calculations. A\n+specifically bad problem is that, if the job restarts due to a crash,\n+Jet must receive again some of the events it already received and\n+processed before the crash. These events will now get different\n+timestamps, affecting a different piece of the aggregation state.\n+\n+On the other hand, this timestamping approach provides the best latency:\n+the job will never wait for delayed items, there's no need to allow any\n+event lag as with event-time processing.\n+\n+## The Improvement\n+\n+We first implemented `WatermarkPolicy.limitingRealTimeLag()`. This\n+policy emits a watermark that lags behind the system clock by a fixed\n+amount. This policy doesn't depend on the events processed, it\n+depends solely on the system clock. Currently, this policy is available\n+only in Core API.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "f99d97c6e9e9c18bb332153be15a8e62c2ad1a5c"}, "originalPosition": 39}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDg3NzE0NDc0", "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/2514#pullrequestreview-487714474", "createdAt": "2020-09-14T12:45:05Z", "commit": {"oid": "f99d97c6e9e9c18bb332153be15a8e62c2ad1a5c"}, "state": "APPROVED", "comments": {"totalCount": 0, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": null, "endCursor": null, "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": []}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 3597, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-01T14:51:55Z"}}}
