This is a step-by-step guide how to deploy Hazelcast Jet\n+cluster together with Management Center on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+## Prerequisites\n+\n+- Kubernetes cluster (with admin rights) and the `kubectl` command\n+  configured (you may use [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/)\n+  )\n+\n+## Installation\n+\n+Hazelcast Jet Operator is published on [OperatorHub.io](https://operatorhub.io/)\n+, registry for Kubernetes Operators. It can be either installed via\n+Operator Lifecycle Manager or manually.\n+\n+### Installing with Operator Lifecycle Manager(OLM)\n+\n+Operator Lifecycle Manager helps you to install, update, and generally\n+manage the lifecycle of all of the operators (and their associated\n+services) running across your clusters.\n+\n+#### Installing the OLM\n+\n+You need to install the OLM to your cluster if it's not yet installed.\n+\n+Check out the [latest releases on GitHub](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/releases)\n+for release-specific install instructions for OLM.\n+\n+To install the OLM, Download the `install.sh` script from the Github\n+Releases page and execute it with the latest OLM version like below:\n+\n+```bash\n+chmod +x install.sh\n+./install.sh <olm-version>\n+```\n+\n+Then you can verify that the OLM is installed and running on your cluster\n+with the command below:\n+\n+```bash\n+$ kubectl get pods -n olm\n+NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\n+catalog-operator-66cf4f96f4-d9t4w   1/1     Running   0          1m\n+olm-operator-9b64f8547-cd67m        1/1     Running   0          1m\n+operatorhubio-catalog-7z5wh         1/1     Running   0          1m\n+packageserver-854879f5cf-49z64      1/1     Running   0          1m\n+packageserver-854879f5cf-r7kzz      1/1     Running   0          1m\n+```\n+\n+#### Installing the Hazelcast Jet Operator\n+\n+Install the Hazelcast Jet Operator by running the following command:\n+\n+```bash\n+kubectl create -f https://operatorhub.io/install/hazelcast-jet-operator.yaml\n+```\n+\n+Hazelcast Jet Operator will be installed in the `operators` namespace\n+and will be usable from all namespaces in the cluster.\n+\n+After install, watch your operator come up using the following command.\n+It might take around a minute for installation to be succeed.\n+\n+```bash\n+$ kubectl get csv -n operators\n+NAME                            DISPLAY                  VERSION   REPLACES   PHASE\n+hazelcast-jet-operator.v0.1.0   Hazelcast Jet Operator   0.1.0                Succeeded\n+```\n+\n+### Manual Installation\n+\n+If you'd like to manually install the Hazelcast Jet Operator without\n+installing the OLM, please follow the README on [Hazelcast Jet Operator](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet-operator/tree/master/hazelcast-jet-operator)\n+GitHub repository.\n+\n+## Creating a Hazelcast Jet Cluster\n+\n+After successfully installing the Hazelcast Jet Operator to your cluster\n+we can now create Hazelcast Jet clusters with the `HazelcastJet` custom\n+resource.\n+\n+Create a file name `hazelcast-jet.yaml` with the contents below:\n+\n+```yaml\n+apiVersion: hazelcast.com/v1alpha1\n+kind: HazelcastJet\n+metadata:\n+  name: jet-cluster\n+spec:\n+  cluster:\n+    memberCount: 2\n+  securityContext:\n+    runAsUser: \"\"\n+    runAsGroup: \"\"\n+    fsGroup: \"\"\n+```\n+\n+**Note:** You can use [this\n+file](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet-operator/blob/master/hazelcast-jet-operator/hazelcast-jet-full.yaml)\n+for configuration options reference.\n+\n+>### Setting the License Key for Management Center (Optional)\n+>\n+>If you do have an\n+>active license subscription for Hazelcast Jet Management Center, use\n+>the configuration below to start your cluster.

This is a step-by-step guide how to deploy Hazelcast Jet\n+cluster together with Management Center on your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+## Prerequisites\n+\n+- Kubernetes cluster (with admin rights) and the `kubectl` command\n+  configured (you may use [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/)\n+  )\n+\n+## Installation\n+\n+Hazelcast Jet Operator is published on [OperatorHub.io](https://operatorhub.io/)\n+, registry for Kubernetes Operators. It can be either installed via\n+Operator Lifecycle Manager or manually.\n+\n+### Installing with Operator Lifecycle Manager(OLM)\n+\n+Operator Lifecycle Manager helps you to install, update, and generally\n+manage the lifecycle of all of the operators (and their associated\n+services) running across your clusters.\n+\n+#### Installing the OLM\n+\n+You need to install the OLM to your cluster if it's not yet installed.\n+\n+Check out the [latest releases on GitHub](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/releases)\n+for release-specific install instructions for OLM.\n+\n+To install the OLM, Download the `install.sh` script from the Github\n+Releases page and execute it with the latest OLM version like below:\n+\n+```bash\n+chmod +x install.sh\n+./install.sh <olm-version>\n+```\n+\n+Then you can verify that the OLM is installed and running on your cluster\n+with the command below:\n+\n+```bash\n+$ kubectl get pods -n olm\n+NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\n+catalog-operator-66cf4f96f4-d9t4w   1/1     Running   0          1m\n+olm-operator-9b64f8547-cd67m        1/1     Running   0          1m\n+operatorhubio-catalog-7z5wh         1/1     Running   0          1m\n+packageserver-854879f5cf-49z64      1/1     Running   0          1m\n+packageserver-854879f5cf-r7kzz      1/1     Running   0          1m\n+```\n+\n+#### Installing the Hazelcast Jet Operator\n+\n+Install the Hazelcast Jet Operator by running the following command:\n+\n+```bash\n+kubectl create -f https://operatorhub.io/install/hazelcast-jet-operator.yaml\n+```\n+\n+Hazelcast Jet Operator will be installed in the `operators` namespace\n+and will be usable from all namespaces in the cluster.\n+\n+After install, watch your operator come up using the following command.\n+It might take around a minute for installation to be succeed.\n+\n+```bash\n+$ kubectl get csv -n operators\n+NAME                            DISPLAY                  VERSION   REPLACES   PHASE\n+hazelcast-jet-operator.v0.1.0   Hazelcast Jet Operator   0.1.0                Succeeded\n+```\n+\n+### Manual Installation\n+\n+If you'd like to manually install the Hazelcast Jet Operator without\n+installing the OLM, please follow the README on [Hazelcast Jet Operator](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet-operator/tree/master/hazelcast-jet-operator)\n+GitHub repository.\n+\n+## Creating a Hazelcast Jet Cluster\n+\n+After successfully installing the Hazelcast Jet Operator to your cluster\n+we can now create Hazelcast Jet clusters with the `HazelcastJet` custom\n+resource.\n+\n+Create a file name `hazelcast-jet.yaml` with the contents below:\n+\n+```yaml\n+apiVersion: hazelcast.com/v1alpha1\n+kind: HazelcastJet\n+metadata:\n+  name: jet-cluster\n+spec:\n+  cluster:\n+    memberCount: 2\n+  securityContext:\n+    runAsUser: \"\"\n+    runAsGroup: \"\"\n+    fsGroup: \"\"\n+```\n+\n+**Note:** You can use [this\n+file](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet-operator/blob/master/hazelcast-jet-operator/hazelcast-jet-full.yaml)\n+for configuration options reference.\n+\n+>### Setting the License Key for Management Center (Optional)\n+>\n+>If you do have an\n+>active license subscription for Hazelcast Jet Management Center, use\n+>the configuration below to start your cluster.
