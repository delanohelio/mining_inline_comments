Applicable also to OBJECT type, if the underlying value is `java.lang.Comparable` |\n+|`MAX(any)` :: _same as input_ | Computes the maximum of the non-null input values. Applicable also to OBJECT type, if the underlying value is `java.lang.Comparable` |\n+\n+Except for `COUNT` the functions return NULL when no rows are\n+aggregated. The functions cannot be applied to streaming inputs: they\n+need to accumulate the whole of input to produce some results and you\n+can't do this with input data.

Trades are\n+encoded as JSON messages:\n+\n+```json\n+{ \"ticker\": \"ABCD\", \"price\": 5.5 }\n+```\n+\n+To use a remote topic as a table in Jet, first create an `EXTERNAL\n+MAPPING`. It maps the JSON messages to a fixed list of columns with\n+data types:\n+\n+```sql\n+CREATE MAPPING trades (\n+    ticker VARCHAR,\n+    value DECIMAL)\n+TYPE Kafka\n+OPTIONS (\n+    valueFormat 'json',\n+    \"bootstrap.servers\" '1.2.3.4',\n+    \"value.deserializer\" 'org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonSerializer')\n+```\n+\n+To submit the above query, use the Java API (we plan JDBC support and\n+support in non-Java clients in the future):\n+\n+```java\n+JetInstance inst = ...;\n+inst.getSql().execute( /* query text */ );\n+```\n+\n+A SQL query can now be used to read from the `trades` topic, as if it\n+was a table:\n+\n+```java\n+JetInstance inst = ...;\n+try (SqlResult result = inst.getSql().execute(\"SELECT * FROM trades\")) {\n+    for (SqlRow row : result) {", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyMjE1ODYyNg=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "ff9deec0825d2c3f508e191d5227c0cb0a1176b5"}, "originalPosition": 74}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMzI3MzU5NTAyOnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "site/docs/sql/00-intro.md", "isResolved": true, "comments": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0xMlQxNDo0NTo0M1rOHx-HYg==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0xNlQwNzo1ODozMlrOHzrgNw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyMjE1OTk3MA==", "bodyText": "\"Aggregating data from files\" - data from Kafka cannot be aggregated?", "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/2636#discussion_r522159970", "createdAt": "2020-11-12T14:45:43Z", "author": {"login": "olukas"}, "path": "site/docs/sql/00-intro.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,202 @@\n+---\n+title: Hazelcast Jet SQL\n+description: Introduction to Hazelcast Jet SQL features.\n+---\n+\n+Hazelcast Jet allows you to create a Jet processing job using the\n+familiar SQL language.
