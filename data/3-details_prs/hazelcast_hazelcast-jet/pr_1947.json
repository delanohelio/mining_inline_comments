For details see link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/rn/index.html#4-0[IMDG Release Notes]. The change most obvious\n+in Jet is that many classes have been moved from the generic `com.hazelcast.core` package to more specific packages,\n+like `com.hazelcast.map` or `com.hazelcast.collection`.\n+\n+* Serializable variants of `java.util.function` interfaces have been moved from Jet (`com.hazelcast.jet.function` package)\n+to IMDG (`com.hazelcast.function` package): `BiConsumerEx`,`BiFunctionEx`, `BinaryOperatorEx`, `BiPredicateEx`,\n+`ComparatorEx`, `ComparatorsEx`, `ConsumerEx`, `FunctionEx`,`Functions`, `PredicateEx`, `SupplierEx`,\n+`ToDoubleFunctionEx`, `ToIntFunctionEx`, `ToLongFunctionEx`.\n+\n+* Generic parameters on several methods and classes have been updated/fixed (i.e. `EntryProcessor`) (see\n+link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/#introducing-lambda-friendly-interfaces[relevant section]\n+in IMDG Migration Guide). These changes have been adopted in Jet.\n+\n+* \"Group name\" config option is now called \"cluster name\". See next code snippet. These changes have been adapted to the\n+Jet Command Line too(`-g/--groupName` replaced by `-n/--cluster-name` option).\n++\n+[source]\n+----\n+include::{javasource}/migration/Migration.java[tag=config1]\n+----\n+\n+* `EventJournalConfig` has been moved from top level `Config` class to data-structure specific configs (`MapConfig`,\n+`CacheConfig`).\n++\n+[source]\n+----\n+include::{javasource}/migration/Migration.java[tag=config2]\n+----\n+\n+* Async methods in IMDG return `CompletionStage` now rather than the old `ICompletableFuture` (see\n+link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/#removal-of-icompletablefuture[relevant section] in\n+IMDG Migration Guide) and these have been adopted in Jet.\n+\n+=== Jet API Changes\n+Jet 4.0 makes multiple breaking changes in its own APIs:\n+\n+* `IMapJet`, `ICacheJet` and `IListJet` interfaces have been removed and have been replaced with IMDG's `IMap`, `ICache`\n+and `IList`.\n+\n+* `Pipeline.drawFrom` has been renamed to `Pipeline.readFrom` and `GeneralStage.drainTo` has been renamed to `GeneralStage.writeTo`.\n++\n+[source]\n+----\n+include::{javasource}/migration/Migration.java[tag=pipeline1]\n+----\n+\n+* ``ContextFactory`` has been renamed to `ServiceFactory` and support for instance-wide initialization has been added\n+to it. It takes `ProcessorSupplier.Context` instead of just `JetInstance` and the convenience methods from `ServiceFactories`\n+should be used for initialization.\n++\n+[source]\n+----\n+include::{javasource}/migration/Migration.java[tag=serviceFactory1]\n+----\n+\n+* `map/filter/flatMapUsingContext` has been renamed to `map/filter/flatMapUsingService`.\n++\n+[source]\n+----\n+include::{javasource}/migration/Migration.java[tag=pipeline2]\n+----\n+\n+* `withMaxPendingCallsPerProcessor(int)` and `withUnorderedAsyncResponses()` methods have been removed from `ServiceFactory`.\n+They have been properties relevant in the context of asynchronous operations, so have been used in conjunction with\n+`GeneralStage.mapUsingServiceAsync(...)` calls.

For details see the\n+https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/rn/index.html#4-0[IMDG Release Notes].\n+The most obvious change is that many classes that used to be in the\n+general `com.hazelcast.core` package are now in specific packages like\n+`com.hazelcast.map` or `com.hazelcast.collection`.\n+\n+* We moved the serializable variants of `java.util.function` interfaces\n+from `com.hazelcast.jet.function` to `com.hazelcast.function`:\n+`BiConsumerEx`,`BiFunctionEx`,`BinaryOperatorEx`, `BiPredicateEx`,\n+`ComparatorEx`, `ComparatorsEx`, `ConsumerEx`, `FunctionEx`, `Functions`,\n+`PredicateEx`, `SupplierEx`, `ToDoubleFunctionEx`, `ToIntFunctionEx`,\n+`ToLongFunctionEx`.\n+\n+* We updated/fixed the type parameters on several methods and classes, for\n+example the `EntryProcessor`. See the\n+https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/#introducing-lambda-friendly-interfaces[relevant section]\n+in the IMDG Migration Guide.\n+\n+* We changed the usage of the term \"group\" in configuration to \"cluster\".\n+See the code snippet below for an example. This changes a Jet Command Line\n+parameter as well (`-g/--groupName` renamed to `-n/--cluster-name`).\n++\n+[source]\n+----\n+include::{javasource}/migration/Migration.java[tag=config1]\n+----\n+\n+* We moved `EventJournalConfig` from the top-level `Config` class to\n+data structure-specific configs (`MapConfig`,`CacheConfig`).\n++\n+[source]\n+----\n+include::{javasource}/migration/Migration.java[tag=config2]\n+----\n+\n+* Async methods that used to return `ICompletableFuture` now return\n+`CompletionStage` (see the\n+https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/#removal-of-icompletablefuture[relevant section]\n+in the IMDG Migration Guide).\n+\n+=== Jet API Changes\n+\n+We made multiple breaking changes in Jet's own APIs too:\n+\n+* We removed the Jet-specific interfaces `IMapJet`, `ICacheJet` and\n+`IListJet` and now use IMDG's `IMap`, `ICache` and `IList` directly.\n+\n+* We renamed `Pipeline.drawFrom` to `Pipeline.readFrom` and\n+`GeneralStage.drainTo` to `GeneralStage.writeTo`.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "1ea9e5a4419a04de54f7bb9030d6a31619a918e8"}, "originalPosition": 105}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3MzU3NTI5ODAx", "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/1947#pullrequestreview-357529801", "createdAt": "2020-02-12T15:09:39Z", "commit": {"oid": "1ea9e5a4419a04de54f7bb9030d6a31619a918e8"}, "state": "APPROVED", "comments": {"totalCount": 0, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": null, "endCursor": null, "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": []}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "6201af694b08689c9af0cb6e78992db67f8bd3e3", "author": {"user": {"login": "mtopolnik", "name": "Marko Topolnik"}}, "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/commit/6201af694b08689c9af0cb6e78992db67f8bd3e3", "committedDate": "2020-02-12T15:35:42Z", "message": "Push key words to the start of bullet points"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3MzU3OTk3NTI2", "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/1947#pullrequestreview-357997526", "createdAt": "2020-02-13T07:19:53Z", "commit": {"oid": "6201af694b08689c9af0cb6e78992db67f8bd3e3"}, "state": "APPROVED", "comments": {"totalCount": 0, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": null, "endCursor": null, "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": []}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "0f354ae66e9a6527ac9872966fc0152c23439cce", "author": {"user": null}, "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/commit/0f354ae66e9a6527ac9872966fc0152c23439cce", "committedDate": "2020-02-13T08:38:56Z", "message": "Add missing items"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3MzU4MDk2MzQ3", "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/1947#pullrequestreview-358096347", "createdAt": "2020-02-13T10:13:43Z", "commit": {"oid": "0f354ae66e9a6527ac9872966fc0152c23439cce"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMi0xM1QxMDoxMzo0NFrOFpOCuA==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMi0xM1QxMDoxMzo0NFrOFpOCuA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3ODc2NjAwOA==", "bodyText": "it would be better to return a List<> and then use Traversers.traverseIterable() in the following step", "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/1947#discussion_r378766008", "createdAt": "2020-02-13T10:13:44Z", "author": {"login": "cangencer"}, "path": "reference-manual/src/main/java/migration/Migration.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,192 @@\n+/*\n+ * Copyright (c) 2008-2020, Hazelcast, Inc.
