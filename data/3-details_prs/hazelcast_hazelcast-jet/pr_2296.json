It was designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe\n+messaging transport.\n+\n+## MQTT Protocol\n+\n+### Publish\n+\n+MQTT utilizes subject-based(topics) filtering of the messages on the\n+broker. Each message contains a topic name, payload (binary format),\n+QoS (Quality of Service Level), identifier and retain-flag.\n+\n+Topic Name: a simple string that is hierarchically structured with\n+'/' as delimiters. For example, \u201cmyhome/livingroom/temperature\u201d.\n+\n+Payload: the actual content of the message in binary format.\n+\n+QoS: a number indicates the delivery guarantee of the message.\n+\n+- 0, fire and forget\n+- 1, at least once (using acknowledgement)\n+- 2, exactly once (using 2-phase acknowledgement)\n+\n+Identifier: a short number that uniquely identifies the messages\n+between the client and broker. This is relevant only for QoS levels\n+greater than 0. Identifier is not unique between all clients and once\n+the message flow is complete can be re-used.\n+\n+Retain Flag: flag that defines whether the message is saved by the\n+broker as the last known good value for the specified topic. When a new\n+client subscribes to a topic, it receives the last message that is\n+retained on that topic.\n+\n+Publishing means sending a message for a specific topic. The broker\n+reads, acknowledges (according to QoS) and processes the message.\n+Processing means determining the clients subscribed to the specified\n+topic and sending the message to them. The publishing client does not\n+know anything about the processing.\n+\n+### Subscribe\n+\n+To receive messages on topics of interest, the client sends a\n+`SUBSCRIBE` message to the broker. The message contains a list of\n+subscriptions which are made of a topic and a QoS level. The topic can\n+contain wildcards that make it possible to subscribe to a topic pattern\n+rather than a specific topic.\n+\n+The broker sends back a return code indicating the QoS level granted\n+for each of the subscription. Messages published at a lower QoS will be\n+received at the published QoS. Messages published at a higher quality\n+of service will be received using the QoS specified on the subscription.\n+If the broker refuses a subscription, the return code indicates the\n+failure rather than QoS. For example, the client may have insufficient\n+permission to subscribe to the topic, or the topic may be malformed.\n+\n+All messages sent with QoS 1 and 2 are queued for offline clients until\n+the client is available again. However, this queuing is only possible\n+if the client has a persistent session.\n+\n+## MQTT Clients\n+\n+We need to pick a java mqtt client for source and sink to connect to\n+the broker. There are several options out there:\n+\n+### Paho Java Client\n+\n+The Eclipse Paho project provides open-source client implementations of\n+MQTT protocols for various languages and [Paho Java Client](https://www.eclipse.org/paho/clients/java/)\n+is one of them. The client offers synchronous and asynchronous APIs, the\n+sync one is a wrapper to the asynchronous one. Paho Java Client does\n+not support MQTT 5.0 protocol yet, it is a work in progress.\n+\n+If not configured explicitly, client will try to connect to the broker\n+using MQTT 3.1.1 protocol and if fails to connect falls back to MQTT\n+3.0 protocol.\n+\n+The client supports:\n+\n+- LWT: Last will and testament\n+- SSL/TLS: secure connection\n+- Message persistence: Client persists messages in case of an\n+  application crash\n+- Automatic reconnect: Automatically reconnects\n+- Offline buffering: Client buffers messages whilst offline to send\n+  when reconnects.\n+- WebSocket: Client can connect to brokers that support WebSockets\n+- High Availability: You can configure multiple brokers and in case of\n+  a failure, client tries other brokers.\n+\n+It is really lightweight(240 KB), single jar without any dependencies.\n+We can say that it is one of the most popular clients.\n+\n+### HiveMQ Client\n+\n+HiveMQ Client uses `Netty` for handling networking and `RxJava` for\n+handling the asynchronous streaming of messages. The client provides\n+three distinct flavours of API: blocking, asynchronous and reactive.\n+HiveMQ Client supports MQTT 5.0 protocol as well as 3.1.1.\n+\n+The client supports:\n+\n+- LWT: Last will and testament\n+- SSL/TLS: secure connection\n+- Automatic reconnect: Automatically reconnects\n+- Offline buffering: Client buffers messages whilst offline to send\n+  when reconnects.\n+- WebSocket: Client can connect to brokers that support WebSockets\n+- Backpressure handling: ask the producers to throttle their output\n+  back (MQTT 5.0 feature, broker needs to have/enabled the feature)\n+\n+HiveMQ Client is not lightweight compared to Paho Java client, 1.1 MB.\n+It has also netty and rxjava dependencies.\n+\n+## MQTT Versions\n+\n+- 1999 MQTT invention\n+- 2010 MQTT 3.1 Royalty-free release\n+- 2014 MQTT 3.1.1 OASIS standard\n+- 2016 MQTT 3.1.1 ISO standard\n+- 2018 MQTT 5 Initial release\n+- 2019 MQTT 5 OASIS standard\n+\n+MQTT 5 brings new features like `Shared subscriptions` and `Time to\n+live` for messages and client sessions and many more. While these new\n+features looks promising, I couldn't find any information regarding the\n+adoption rate of MQTT 5. The only java client supports MQTT 5 is\n+`HiveMQ Client` and for other languages I've found only a single\n+library or none at all.\n+\n+## MQTT Connector\n+\n+We choose `Paho Java Client` over `HiveMQ Client` since it is\n+lightweight and without dependencies. `Paho Java Client` does not\n+support MQTT 5, but the adoption rate of MQTT 5 is questionable.\n+\n+### Source\n+\n+We use our `SourceBuilder` to create a streaming source for MQTT\n+messages. Source is not distributed, it creates a client on one of the\n+members and subscribes to the topics.\n+\n+The subscription mechanism is push-based. We set a callback to the\n+client, and it is called as the messages arrived. Since our\n+`SourceBuilder` is designed for pull based systems, we buffer the\n+messages to a blocking queue and drain them in the `fillBufferFn`. We\n+apply the given mapping function to the binary message and keep the\n+mapped item in the queue.\n+\n+#### API\n+\n+Since there are several configuration options for the source, we\n+created a `MqttSourceBuilder` to configure and build the source. We've\n+also introduced a class named `Subscription` which consists of the\n+topic and quality of service for that topic.\n+\n+Below is a usage example of the source builder with all the\n+configuration options:\n+\n+```java\n+MqttSources.builder()\n+        .clientId(\"consumer\")\n+        .broker(\"tcp://localhost:1883\")\n+        .auth(\"username\", \"password\".toCharArray())\n+        .topic(\"topic\")\n+        .qualityOfService(QualityOfService.EXACTLY_ONCE)\n+        .autoReconnect()\n+        .keepSession()\n+        .mapToItemFn((topic, message) -> message.toString())\n+        .build();\n+```\n+\n+You can also subscribe to multiple topics and can provide a\n+`MqttConnectOptions` function instead of configuring the options one by\n+one:\n+\n+```java\n+MqttSources.builder()\n+        .clientId(\"consumer\")\n+        .broker(\"tcp://localhost:1883\")\n+        .subscriptions(Subscription.of(\"topic1\"), Subscription.of(\"topic2\", QualityOfService.EXACTLY_ONCE))\n+        .connectOptionsFn(() -> {\n+            MqttConnectOptions options = new MqttConnectOptions();\n+            options.setCleanSession(false);\n+            options.setAutomaticReconnect(true);\n+            options.setUserName(\"username\");\n+            options.setPassword(\"password\".toCharArray());\n+            options.setMaxInflight(100);\n+            return options;\n+        })\n+        .mapToItemFn((topic, message) -> message.toString())\n+        .build();\n+```\n+\n+#### Fault Tolerance\n+\n+Mqtt protocol defines these quality of services for subscribing the\n+topics: `AT_MOST_ONCE`, `AT_LEAST_ONCE`, `EXACTLY_ONCE`. But I've\n+confirmed loss of message with `EXACTLY_ONCE` configuration even when\n+the client restarted gracefully. I'm not sure if this is an issue of\n+the client or the broker. I'll test the behaviour with HiveMQ client\n+too.\n+\n+If a client subscribes to a topic with quality of service `AT_LEAST_ONCE`\n+or `EXACTLY_ONCE` and connects to the broker with `cleanSession=false`,\n+then the broker keeps the messages in case of a disconnection. Broker\n+serves these buffered messages once the client is re-connected. You\n+need to use a unique identifier for the client.\n+\n+The source itself is not fault tolerant and does not save any state. In\n+case of a restart, source does not know where it left and relies on the\n+broker. If broker keeps a session for the client (above situation),\n+source continues where it left otherwise the source emits messages after\n+the subscription.\n+\n+Paho client has an `autoReconnect` option, in case of a disconnect\n+client tries to reconnect to the broker. After the reconnection, source\n+re-subscribes to the topics.\n+\n+### Sink\n+\n+We use `SinkBuilder` to create a sink for MQTT messages. The sink\n+creates a client for each processor and publishes messages to the\n+specified topic. We append the global processor index to the specified\n+clientId for uniqueness, e.g `producer-1`, `producer-2`...\n+\n+Paho client has a configuration called `maxInflight` which limits the\n+`in-flight` messages with quality of service `AT_LEAST_ONCE` and\n+`EXACTLY_ONCE`. This limitation is per client. Sink uses a semaphore\n+with the permit count of specified `maxInflight` to limit the messages.\n+Sink does not apply this limiting to the messages with quality of\n+service `AT_MOST_ONCE`.\n+\n+#### API\n+\n+Since there are several configuration options for the sink, we created\n+a `MqttSinkBuilder` to configure and build the sink.\n+\n+Below is a usage example of the sink builder with all the configuration\n+options:\n+\n+```java\n+MqttSinks.builder()\n+        .clientId(\"producer\")\n+        .broker(\"tcp://localhost:1883\")\n+        .auth(\"username\", \"password\".toCharArray())\n+        .topic(\"topic\")\n+        .autoReconnect()\n+        .keepSession()\n+        .messageFn(item -> {\n+            MqttMessage message = new MqttMessage(item.getBytes());\n+            message.setQos(2);\n+            return message;\n+        })\n+        .build();\n+```\n+\n+You can also provide a `MqttConnectOptions` function instead of\n+configuring the options one by one:\n+\n+```java\n+MqttSinks.builder()\n+        .clientId(\"producer\")\n+        .broker(\"tcp://localhost:1883\")\n+        .connectOptionsFn(() -> {\n+            MqttConnectOptions options = new MqttConnectOptions();\n+            options.setCleanSession(false);\n+            options.setAutomaticReconnect(true);\n+            options.setUserName(\"username\");\n+            options.setPassword(\"password\".toCharArray());\n+            options.setMaxInflight(100);\n+            return options;\n+        })\n+        .topic(\"topic\")\n+        .messageFn(item -> {\n+            MqttMessage message = new MqttMessage(item.getBytes());\n+            message.setQos(2);\n+            return message;\n+        })\n+        .build();\n+```\n+\n+#### Fault Tolerance\n+\n+The sink is not fault tolerant and does not save any state.

The broker\n+serves these buffered messages once the client is re-connected. You\n+need to use a unique identifier for the client.\n+\n+The source itself is not fault-tolerant and does not save any state. In\n+case of a restart, the source does not know where it left and relies on\n+the broker. If the broker keeps a session for the client (above\n+situation), the source continues where it left otherwise the source\n+emits messages after the subscription.\n+\n+Paho client has an `autoReconnect` option, in case of a disconnect, the\n+client tries to reconnect to the broker. After the reconnection, source\n+re-subscribes to the topics.\n+\n+### Sink\n+\n+We use `SinkBuilder` to create a sink for MQTT messages. The sink\n+creates a client for each processor and publishes messages to the\n+specified topic. We append the global processor index to the specified\n+clientId for uniqueness, e.g `producer-1`, `producer-2`...\n+\n+#### API\n+\n+Since there are several configuration options for the sink, we created\n+a `MqttSinkBuilder` to configure and build the sink.\n+\n+Below is a usage example of the sink builder with all the configuration\n+options:\n+\n+```java\n+MqttSinks.builder()\n+        .clientId(\"producer\")\n+        .broker(\"tcp://localhost:1883\")\n+        .auth(\"username\", \"password\".toCharArray())\n+        .topic(\"topic\")\n+        .autoReconnect()\n+        .keepSession()\n+        .retryCount(5)\n+        .messageFn(item -> {\n+            MqttMessage message = new MqttMessage(item.getBytes());\n+            message.setQos(2);\n+            return message;\n+        })\n+        .build();\n+```\n+\n+You can provide a `MqttConnectOptions` function instead of configuring\n+the options one by one.\n+\n+```java\n+MqttSinks.builder()\n+        .clientId(\"producer\")\n+        .broker(\"tcp://localhost:1883\")\n+        .connectOptionsFn(() -> {\n+            MqttConnectOptions options = new MqttConnectOptions();\n+            options.setCleanSession(false);\n+            options.setAutomaticReconnect(true);\n+            options.setUserName(\"username\");\n+            options.setPassword(\"password\".toCharArray());\n+            options.setMaxInflight(100);\n+            return options;\n+        })\n+        .retryFn((exception, tryCount) -> {\n+            if(tryCount > 5) {\n+                return 0;\n+            }\n+            if(exception.getReasonCode() != MqttException.REASON_CODE_BROKER_UNAVAILABLE) {\n+                return 0;\n+            }\n+            return 200;\n+        })\n+        .topic(\"topic\")\n+        .messageFn(item -> {\n+            MqttMessage message = new MqttMessage(item.getBytes());\n+            message.setQos(2);\n+            return message;\n+        })\n+        .build();\n+```\n+\n+#### Fault Tolerance\n+\n+The sink is not fault-tolerant and does not save any state. In case of\n+a restart, some messages can be duplicated.\n+\n+#### Error handling\n+\n+The sink uses sync client to publish the messages. Any error/exception\n+encountered while publishing the messages will fail the job. User can\n+configure the retrying of the messages by providing a retry function.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "7e157e3b86884dabb8596c0488db9d99d92fdcb2"}, "originalPosition": 301}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NTI4MTg1ODA4", "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/2296#pullrequestreview-528185808", "createdAt": "2020-11-11T13:48:16Z", "commit": {"oid": "7e157e3b86884dabb8596c0488db9d99d92fdcb2"}, "state": "APPROVED", "comments": {"totalCount": 0, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": null, "endCursor": null, "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": []}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NTI4ODU0NTc3", "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/2296#pullrequestreview-528854577", "createdAt": "2020-11-12T08:34:39Z", "commit": {"oid": "7e157e3b86884dabb8596c0488db9d99d92fdcb2"}, "state": "APPROVED", "comments": {"totalCount": 0, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": null, "endCursor": null, "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": []}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "981b54b97b22c514739de46396e9ca504c761ea3", "author": {"user": null}, "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/commit/981b54b97b22c514739de46396e9ca504c761ea3", "committedDate": "2020-11-23T07:16:35Z", "message": "update retry-strategy"}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 3645, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-01T14:51:55Z"}}}
