My vote is to keep return type to \"void\" .\nWith the \"void\", it means that exception is thrown for the client if something is bad (duplicate name etc). Which is in general better IMO as client knows that something was wrong. With \"Response\", the client explicitly needs to check if response status was correct, also he may need to close the responses etc. Just my 2 cents.\n@stianst wdyt about this?\nBTV. It is fine to change the server method with return type \"Response\" and just the client keep to \"void\" .

I was trying to follow convention of other API's.  Now I see that some use an exception while others stuff an error into a Response.  (I also found that the admin UI handles a Response better than an exception.  In the future we need to handle errors consistently and also localize the error messages.)\nI would prefer to not change this code just because I would have to go in and rewrite a lot of stuff, especially the tests.

There is no other @put method, which returns \"Response\" . Also changing org.keycloak.admin.client.resource.GroupResource.update to return \"Response\" instead of \"void\" can theoretically break backwards compatibility for some clients, who use this (they rely on catching the Exception and now they will need to change to rely on checking Response status).\nAlso I think that admin client is unrelated to the admin UI as admin UI doesn't use admin-client? IMO it's not an issue to keep just org.keycloak.admin.client.resource.GroupResource.update to return \"void\", but return \"Response\" from the server-side org.keycloak.services.resources.admin.GroupResource .
