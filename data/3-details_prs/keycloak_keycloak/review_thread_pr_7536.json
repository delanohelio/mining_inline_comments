I understand it is not possible now, as apparently there is a lot of code relying on it, but we should not support using it, therefore I would leave the @deprecated comment as is or at least I would add some warning to the javadoc that this should be used only in case it is really necessary.", "url": "https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/pull/7536#discussion_r512640458", "createdAt": "2020-10-27T12:10:25Z", "author": {"login": "mhajas"}, "path": "server-spi/src/main/java/org/keycloak/models/ClientModel.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -34,10 +36,33 @@\n     String PUBLIC_KEY = \"publicKey\";\n     String X509CERTIFICATE = \"X509Certificate\";\n \n+    interface ClientCreationEvent extends ProviderEvent {\n+        ClientModel getCreatedClient();\n+    }\n+\n+    // Called also during client creation after client is fully initialized (including all attributes etc)\n+    interface ClientUpdatedEvent extends ProviderEvent {\n+        ClientModel getUpdatedClient();\n+        KeycloakSession getKeycloakSession();\n+    }\n+\n+    interface ClientRemovedEvent extends ProviderEvent {\n+        ClientModel getClient();\n+        KeycloakSession getKeycloakSession();\n+    }\n+\n     /**\n-     * Stores the current state of the client immediately to the underlying store, similarly to a commit.\n+     * Notifies other providers that this client has been updated.\n+     * <p>\n+     * After a client is updated, providers can register for {@link ClientUpdatedEvent}.\n+     * The setters in this model do not send an update for individual updates of the model.\n+     * This method is here to allow for sending this event for this client,\n+     * allowsing for to group multiple changes of a client and signal that\n+     * all the changes in this client have been performed.\n      *\n-     * @deprecated Do not use, to be removed\n+     * @see ProviderEvent\n+     * @see ProviderEventManager\n+     * @see ClientUpdatedEvent\n      */\n     void updateClient();", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "12ed78a41d4f406c1f1bf6f43830fbedde5cf385"}, "originalPosition": 43}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxMjY1MDE0NQ==", "bodyText": "You are right, I missed the removal of this comment.
