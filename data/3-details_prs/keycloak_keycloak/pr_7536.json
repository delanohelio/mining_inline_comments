I understand it is not possible now, as apparently there is a lot of code relying on it, but we should not support using it, therefore I would leave the @deprecated comment as is or at least I would add some warning to the javadoc that this should be used only in case it is really necessary.", "url": "https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/pull/7536#discussion_r512640458", "createdAt": "2020-10-27T12:10:25Z", "author": {"login": "mhajas"}, "path": "server-spi/src/main/java/org/keycloak/models/ClientModel.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -34,10 +36,33 @@\n     String PUBLIC_KEY = \"publicKey\";\n     String X509CERTIFICATE = \"X509Certificate\";\n \n+    interface ClientCreationEvent extends ProviderEvent {\n+        ClientModel getCreatedClient();\n+    }\n+\n+    // Called also during client creation after client is fully initialized (including all attributes etc)\n+    interface ClientUpdatedEvent extends ProviderEvent {\n+        ClientModel getUpdatedClient();\n+        KeycloakSession getKeycloakSession();\n+    }\n+\n+    interface ClientRemovedEvent extends ProviderEvent {\n+        ClientModel getClient();\n+        KeycloakSession getKeycloakSession();\n+    }\n+\n     /**\n-     * Stores the current state of the client immediately to the underlying store, similarly to a commit.\n+     * Notifies other providers that this client has been updated.\n+     * <p>\n+     * After a client is updated, providers can register for {@link ClientUpdatedEvent}.\n+     * The setters in this model do not send an update for individual updates of the model.\n+     * This method is here to allow for sending this event for this client,\n+     * allowsing for to group multiple changes of a client and signal that\n+     * all the changes in this client have been performed.\n      *\n-     * @deprecated Do not use, to be removed\n+     * @see ProviderEvent\n+     * @see ProviderEventManager\n+     * @see ClientUpdatedEvent\n      */\n     void updateClient();", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "12ed78a41d4f406c1f1bf6f43830fbedde5cf385"}, "originalPosition": 43}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "ecffcec40ff4994f29cab833fdc230c9f756d054", "author": {"user": {"login": "hmlnarik", "name": "Hynek Mlna\u0159\u00edk"}}, "url": "https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/commit/ecffcec40ff4994f29cab833fdc230c9f756d054", "committedDate": "2020-10-27T12:27:49Z", "message": "KEYCLOAK-16077 Remove need for MapStorage.replace"}}, {"__typename": "HeadRefForcePushedEvent", "beforeCommit": {"oid": "12ed78a41d4f406c1f1bf6f43830fbedde5cf385", "author": {"user": {"login": "hmlnarik", "name": "Hynek Mlna\u0159\u00edk"}}, "url": "https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/commit/12ed78a41d4f406c1f1bf6f43830fbedde5cf385", "committedDate": "2020-10-26T11:19:28Z", "message": "KEYCLOAK-16021 Remove need for MapStorage.replace"}, "afterCommit": {"oid": "ecffcec40ff4994f29cab833fdc230c9f756d054", "author": {"user": {"login": "hmlnarik", "name": "Hynek Mlna\u0159\u00edk"}}, "url": "https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/commit/ecffcec40ff4994f29cab833fdc230c9f756d054", "committedDate": "2020-10-27T12:27:49Z", "message": "KEYCLOAK-16077 Remove need for MapStorage.replace"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NTE3NjczNjM2", "url": "https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/pull/7536#pullrequestreview-517673636", "createdAt": "2020-10-27T12:59:51Z", "commit": {"oid": "ecffcec40ff4994f29cab833fdc230c9f756d054"}, "state": "APPROVED", "comments": {"totalCount": 0, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": null, "endCursor": null, "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": []}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NTE5NzM2NzEx", "url": "https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/pull/7536#pullrequestreview-519736711", "createdAt": "2020-10-29T14:39:42Z", "commit": {"oid": "ecffcec40ff4994f29cab833fdc230c9f756d054"}, "state": "APPROVED", "comments": {"totalCount": 0, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": null, "endCursor": null, "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": []}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 3379, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-01T15:33:45Z"}}}
