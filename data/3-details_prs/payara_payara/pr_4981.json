If the EJB had methods annotated with PermitAll however, this would prevent you from accessing these methods without providing authentication since you could not perform the initial context lookup.\nImportant Info\nThis should ideally be run through the JakartaEE TCK before being merged, due to the security implication of me cracking the door open slightly.\nDependant PRs\nNone\nBlockers\nNone\nTesting\nAdded some new tests and ran some small bits of the Jakarta TCK and Java EE7 Samples.\nNew tests\nAdded a new sample to payara-samples, which only runs if using the payara-server-remote profile.\nIt runs the following checks:\n\nEJB can be injected into a servlet without authentication (working as it did before these changes).\n\nMethod annotated with PermitAll can be accessed (working as it did before these changes).\nMethod annotated with RolesAllowed can not be accessed (working as it did before these changes).\n\n\nStandalone Java client can perform lookup on EJB annotated with a mix of RolesAllowed and PermitAll annotations\n\nMethod annotated with PermitAll can be accessed\nMethod annotated with RolesAllowed can not be accessed\n\n\nStandalone Java client can not perform lookup on an EJB annotated only with RolesAllowed.\n\nDocumentation\nN/A\nNotes for Reviewers\nI can't find the CSIv2 spec so I don't know if this default behaviour of locking the door for lookups if a single checked method is detected is expected.", "createdAt": "2020-11-04T14:03:01Z", "url": "https://github.com/payara/Payara/pull/4981", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "397fb8be229ab37776b0a6caf467af4642b46def"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-11-13T15:24:56Z", "author": {"login": "Pandrex247"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 9, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABdbvxLvgFqTUyODkzNTc3MA==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABdcDs3TABqjM5OTI2MDY3MjA=", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NTI4OTM1Nzcw", "url": "https://github.com/payara/Payara/pull/4981#pullrequestreview-528935770", "createdAt": "2020-11-12T10:12:27Z", "commit": {"oid": "a3cdc67aee5be84e2546f6197b44095e7e588b38"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 0, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": null, "endCursor": null, "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": []}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NTI5MDY0NDEz", "url": "https://github.com/payara/Payara/pull/4981#pullrequestreview-529064413", "createdAt": "2020-11-12T13:03:07Z", "commit": {"oid": "f727a1fe5e6365240eb1f31fbfb992d8001b1be8"}, "state": "CHANGES_REQUESTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 4, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0xMlQxMzowMzowN1rOHx5zvQ==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0xMlQxMzowNDoyNVrOHx52mw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyMjA4OTQwNQ==", "bodyText": "Rebase to a new snapshot version, please ... now it is 5.2020.7-SNAPSHOT", "url": "https://github.com/payara/Payara/pull/4981#discussion_r522089405", "createdAt": "2020-11-12T13:03:07Z", "author": {"login": "dmatej"}, "path": "appserver/tests/payara-samples/samples/rolesallowed-unprotected-methods/pom.xml", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,75 @@\n+<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n+<!--\n+  DO NOT ALTER OR REMOVE COPYRIGHT NOTICES OR THIS HEADER.\n+\n+  Copyright (c) 2020 Payara Foundation and/or its affiliates.
