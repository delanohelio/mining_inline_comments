This exception is also thrown at least to xroad-proxy, signer-cli, and in theory could by unwanted in those. It is just a text change so the probability of it breaking things should be minimal, though.\nMaybe we should add a way to define core error messages (or overrides to default messages) inside proxy-ui-api module.\nLet's work on this if we get more of these UI-rooted needs to change error messages.
