Issues: Bug Reports\n+One of the foundations for good software is reliability. To facilitate this reliability, our community must work together to crush bugs that arise. \n+This of course requires good information and knowledge about ongoing bugs and issues though.\n+\n+You can help this project by reporting a bug on our [Issues Tracker](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/issues).<br>\n+Please adhere to the provided template and provide as much information as possible.\n+For more info on how to make good and helpful bug reports, check out our article on [How to report bugs](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/How-to-report-bugs).\n+\n+If you encounter an issue which has already been reported, please don't open a new one.<br>\n+It would be awesome though if you could post a comment on the existing issue which explains how you were able to reproduce this yourself.\n+The more context and information we get, the easier we can fix it\n+\n+## 2. Pull Requests: Bug Fixes\n+Bugs that have been reported need to be fixed of course.<br>\n+Any open Issue on our [Issues Tracker](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/issues) is waiting to be fixed.\n+\n+This is an Open-Source project and we love Pull Requests. \n+So if you have an idea on how to approach a known issue, feel free to make a [Pull Request](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/pulls) which fixes this bug.\n+You can also comment on the existing Issue, proposing your idea or communicating that you wanna work on this.\n+\n+## 3.

Wiki contributions\n+Slimefun is a very large project and might be quite intimidating for new players.\n+That's why good documentation is always nice and helpful.\n+If you have played with Slimefun for a while and gotten yourself familiar with how things work, please consider contributing your experiences and knowledge to others via the wiki!\n+It would help out a lot <3\n+\n+You can find a tutorial on how to contribute to our wiki right here:<br>\n+https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Expanding-the-Wiki\n+\n+## 6. Pull Requests: Code Quality\n+Slimefun uses [sonarcloud.io](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=TheBusyBiscuit_Slimefun4) to monitor Code Quality.\n+\n+We always welcome quality improvements to the code and the \"Code Smells\" section on [sonarcloud.io](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=TheBusyBiscuit_Slimefun4) is a great place to start.\n+But please keep in mind that some design patterns may not be changed too abruptly if an addon depends on them. \n+To prevent any accidents from happening, please contact us on our [Discord Server](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4#discord) before-hand and state your intended changes.\n+\n+#### documentation", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "ec6d76d46d73b8f40e3b6a9ab8a5477ff8e01f02"}, "originalPosition": 64}]}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 327, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-12T12:57:47Z"}}}
