In this case, even though there is some state on disk, we will delete it. The state on disk might have helped this replica in catching up with existing replicas quicker. But I assuming that we are ignoring this scenario because we don't have a way to identify this scenario.

Note that, if this added replica was ready in BOOTSTRAP -> STANDBY before node crashed, that means it should have already updated InstanceConfig in Helix (this is the last step in OFFLINE -> BOOTSTRAP). So, after node reboots, storage manager/disk manager should be aware of this replica and don't attempt to add it again.\nThe failure I want to address in this PR occurs before new added replica updates InstanceConfig, so the new replica may be created but still empty.
