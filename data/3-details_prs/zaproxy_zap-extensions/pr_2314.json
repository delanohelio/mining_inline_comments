This also includes minor help updates, formatting, and the README documents in the master branch of the main repo at https://github.com/veggiespam/ImageLocationScanner .  With respect to the help docs, I believe I created them in the correct location, but I am unsure how to generate everything.\nAdditionally, from the gradle build process created by the ZAP team in zap-extensions, the ticket for zaproxy/zaproxy#4295 may now be ready for promotion.  I had to drop the project temporarily and appreciate your team continuing with the efforts.\nPlease let me know of any mods/updates needed to get the updates into ZAP.
