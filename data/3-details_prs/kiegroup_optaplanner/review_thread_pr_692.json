(I am not saying it is an abstracted test)\nI personally favor concrete tests a lot of abstracted tests.\nFor example:\n// Concrete test\nassertEquals(7, calculator.sum(2, 5));\nassertEquals(7, calculator.sum(4, 3));\nassertEquals(9, calculator.sum(4, 5));\n\n// Abstracted test\nfor (i = 0; i < 7; i++) {\n  for (j = 0; j < 7; i++) {\n   assertEquals(i + j, calculator.sum(i, j));\n  }\n}\n\nAbstracted tests do more tests, but often don't increase test coverage. They make it hard to read what happens in corner cases - which can lead to invalid tests. And they often copy-paste the mistakes from the unit into the unit test code (especially corner cases).", "url": "https://github.com/kiegroup/optaplanner/pull/692#discussion_r380529966", "createdAt": "2020-02-18T08:51:05Z", "author": {"login": "ge0ffrey"}, "path": "optaplanner-core/src/test/java/org/optaplanner/core/api/score/stream/ConstraintCollectorsTest.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -1324,13 +1325,229 @@ public void minNotComparable() {\n         assertResult(collector, container, null);\n     }\n \n+    @Test\n+    public void minComparableMapped() {", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "8ee64c636beda1959871089f79fdf7f04493ad05"}, "originalPosition": 67}]}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 4631, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-12T20:44:06Z"}}}
