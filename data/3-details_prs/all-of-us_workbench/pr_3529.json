Since our `EmployeeDbEntity` class doesn't have an attribute named `name`\n+(or a `getName()` method), it doesn't just grab any String property from that class and hope for the\n+best. We had to tell it in a `@Mapping` annotation that it can in fact get a `String` called \"name\" from this\n+`employeeDbEntity` if it looks a little harder.\n+\n+Since our default method takes in the entity and returns a string, this is a good candidate, and\n+that's what it uses.\n+\n+What if we hadn't named it `toName()`? I tried that just now and the answer was slightly surprising:\n+it generated a line like `employeeModel.setName( toNickname( employeeDbEntity ) );`. I, for one,\n+welcome our new automatically programmed overlords.\n+\n+We have two more properties to fix: the enum `department`, and the `double salary`. Let's start with\n+the enum. It's class definition looks like this:\n+```java\n+public enum Department {\n+  SALES(0),\n+  MARKETING(1),\n+  IT(2);\n+\n+  private int departmentCode;\n+\n+  Department(int departmentCode) {\n+    this.departmentCode = departmentCode;\n+  }\n+\n+  public int getDepartmentCode() {\n+    return departmentCode;\n+  }\n+\n+  public static Department fromDepartmentCode(int code) {\n+    switch(code) {\n+      case 0:\n+        return SALES;\n+      case 1:\n+        return MARKETING;\n+      case 2:\n+        return IT;\n+      default:\n+        return SALES; // they never know their code, so probably them\n+    }\n+  }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+I thought I'd be clever and just pull in the enum type via a `uses` directive at the top of the mapper:\n+```java\n+@Mapper(uses = Department.class)\n+```\n+This did exactly the wrong thing.

Then\n+proceed one property at a time until all the warnings are gone.\n+ \n+### Proofread the generated code\n+First, you should *always* look at the generated code and step through it in the debugger. This is\n+because, while the codegen should be deterministic, most of us don't go around with its order of\n+operator precedence in our head. Particularly if you have many input parameters with multiple fields\n+with common names, you may find that `foo.id` is getting used instead of `bar.id` becase one's a \n+`long` and the other an `int`. Or something. \n+\n+In general, the library gives very reasonable error\n+messages and is very cranky at compile time. This is A Good Thing.\n+\n+## Write tests for mappers\n+It's pretty tedious to write tests for generated code, as the computer is coding faster than you.\n+I still think it's worth it, because,\n+- it documents usage of your generated methods\n+- you catch things the compiler can't (such as when a string format changes)\n+- it's a good opportunity to update old test code\n+- It makes it look less magical\n+\n+### Consider other use cases\n+It's possible to write a mapper from a type to itself and use that as a copy constructor of sorts.\n+\n+### Tune the classes' public APIs\n+If you find yourself writing arcane helper methods, ask yourself if adding a simple setter or\n+getter on one of your classes would make the job easier and the generated code cleaner. Since our\n+model classes are generated, we frequently have to have external helper methods defined in either\n+the mapper class or a utility class.\n+\n+## Handling missing target properties\n+### Avoid `ignore = true` unless absolutely necessary\n+It's annoying to see warnings about missing target properties, and for good reason. The quick way to\n+stifle these is to use the `ignore` parameter, which tells MapStruct to elide the setter code for\n+that target property.\n+```java\n+@Mapping(target = \"billingAccountName\", ignore = true)\n+```\n+\n+While there are some places this is necessary, it should really be a last resort, for a couple of\n+reasons.\n+\n+First, we plan to use mappers to replace existing chunks of code in a clean way.

Why do I need it?\n+Everything MapStruct does is simple and deterministic, and every programmer has done it before. So why\n+bring in another library and codegen step? What's the advantage?\n+\n+First, by defining a mapper, you're adding some executable documentation to your types, and being\n+explicit about how they should map.\n+ \n+Second, you don't have to rely on developers to perform awkward null\n+checks for every field, as you get that for free. The generated code is very uniform and thus\n+quite readable.\n+\n+Third, and most important, is that once you've defined a mapper, maintenance is very easy. New fields\n+will simply be mapped for you (assuming they exist on both the source and the target type). If there's\n+a new target field that doesn't have a sourcce, youll gget a compile-time warning reminding you. (It's\n+important to stay on top of those). \n+\n+### Examples\n+Consider an `EmployeeModel` class:\n+```java\n+public class EmployeeModel {\n+  private String name;\n+  private Department department;\n+  private String address;\n+  private double salary;\n+\n+  public EmployeeModel() {\n+  }\n+\n+  public EmployeeModel(String name,\n+      Department department, String address, double salary) {\n+    this.name = name;\n+    this.department = department;\n+    this.address = address;\n+    this.salary = salary;\n+  }\n+\n+  public String getName() {\n+    return name;\n+  }\n+  public void setName(String name) {\n+    this.name = name;\n+  }\n+\n+  public Department getDepartment() {\n+    return department;\n+  }\n+  public void setDepartment(Department department) {\n+    this.department = department;\n+  }\n+\n+  public double getSalary() {\n+    return salary;\n+  }\n+  public void setSalary(double salary) {\n+    this.salary = salary;\n+  }\n+\n+  public double getWeeklySalary() {\n+    return getSalary() / 52.0;\n+  }\n+\n+  public String getAddress() {\n+    return address;\n+  }\n+\n+  public void setAddress(String address) {\n+    this.address = address;\n+  }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Additionally, we have a (nearly) corresponding entity in the database.

Since our `EmployeeDbEntity` class doesn't have an attribute named `name`\n+(or a `getName()` method), it doesn't just grab any String property from that class and hope for the\n+best. We had to tell it in a `@Mapping` annotation that it can in fact get a `String` called \"name\" from this\n+`employeeDbEntity` if it looks a little harder.\n+\n+Since our default method takes in the entity and returns a string, this is a good candidate, and\n+that's what it uses.\n+\n+What if we hadn't named it `toName()`?

Then\n+proceed one property at a time until all the warnings are gone.\n+ \n+### Proofread the generated code\n+First, you should *always* look at the generated code and step through it in the debugger. This is\n+because, while the codegen should be deterministic, most of us don't go around with its order of\n+operator precedence in our head. Particularly if you have many input parameters with multiple fields\n+with common names, you may find that `foo.id` is getting used instead of `bar.id` becase one's a \n+`long` and the other an `int`. Or something. \n+\n+In general, the library gives very reasonable error\n+messages and is very cranky at compile time. This is A Good Thing.\n+\n+## Write tests for mappers\n+It's pretty tedious to write tests for generated code, as the computer is coding faster than you.\n+I still think it's worth it, because,\n+- it documents usage of your generated methods\n+- you catch things the compiler can't (such as when a string format changes)\n+- it's a good opportunity to update old test code\n+- It makes it look less magical\n+\n+### Consider other use cases\n+It's possible to write a mapper from a type to itself and use that as a copy constructor of sorts.\n+\n+### Tune the classes' public APIs\n+If you find yourself writing arcane helper methods, ask yourself if adding a simple setter or\n+getter on one of your classes would make the job easier and the generated code cleaner. Since our\n+model classes are generated, we frequently have to have external helper methods defined in either\n+the mapper class or a utility class.\n+\n+## Handling missing target properties\n+### Avoid `ignore = true` unless absolutely necessary\n+It's annoying to see warnings about missing target properties, and for good reason. The quick way to\n+stifle these is to use the `ignore` parameter, which tells MapStruct to elide the setter code for\n+that target property.\n+```java\n+@Mapping(target = \"billingAccountName\", ignore = true)\n+```\n+\n+While there are some places this is necessary, it should really be a last resort, for a couple of\n+reasons.\n+\n+First, we plan to use mappers to replace existing chunks of code in a clean way.

Then\n+proceed one property at a time until all the warnings are gone.\n+ \n+### Proofread the generated code\n+First, you should *always* look at the generated code and step through it in the debugger. This is\n+because, while the codegen should be deterministic, most of us don't go around with its order of\n+operator precedence in our head. Particularly if you have many input parameters with multiple fields\n+with common names, you may find that `foo.id` is getting used instead of `bar.id` becase one's a \n+`long` and the other an `int`. Or something. \n+\n+In general, the library gives very reasonable error\n+messages and is very cranky at compile time. This is A Good Thing.\n+\n+## Write tests for mappers\n+It's pretty tedious to write tests for generated code, as the computer is coding faster than you.\n+I still think it's worth it, because,\n+- it documents usage of your generated methods\n+- you catch things the compiler can't (such as when a string format changes)\n+- it's a good opportunity to update old test code\n+- It makes it look less magical\n+\n+### Consider other use cases\n+It's possible to write a mapper from a type to itself and use that as a copy constructor of sorts.\n+\n+### Tune the classes' public APIs\n+If you find yourself writing arcane helper methods, ask yourself if adding a simple setter or\n+getter on one of your classes would make the job easier and the generated code cleaner. Since our\n+model classes are generated, we frequently have to have external helper methods defined in either\n+the mapper class or a utility class.\n+\n+## Handling missing target properties\n+### Avoid `ignore = true` unless absolutely necessary\n+It's annoying to see warnings about missing target properties, and for good reason. The quick way to\n+stifle these is to use the `ignore` parameter, which tells MapStruct to elide the setter code for\n+that target property.\n+```java\n+@Mapping(target = \"billingAccountName\", ignore = true)\n+```\n+\n+While there are some places this is necessary, it should really be a last resort, for a couple of\n+reasons.\n+\n+First, we plan to use mappers to replace existing chunks of code in a clean way. We don't want to\n+have to docment that mapping function X leaves the created object in state Y with respect to fields\n+P, Q, and R. Many of our objects are relatively complex, and it's not obvious when looking at a call\n+to `fooMapper.toModel()` that the output model is incomplete in some way(s).\n+\n+Second, if a target property is difficuult to satisfy, this is a signal that either our class design\n+could be better, or we've left out a prereqisite.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "84460942f76b953a05feded4ecc46f5575753e98"}, "originalPosition": 526}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQxOTY0NTg3Mg==", "bodyText": "defauld -> default", "url": "https://github.com/all-of-us/workbench/pull/3529#discussion_r419645872", "createdAt": "2020-05-04T18:39:03Z", "author": {"login": "als364"}, "path": "api/docs/mapstruct.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,608 @@\n+# MapStruct Best Practices\n+## What is MapStruct?\n+[MapStruct](https://mapstruct.org/documentation/stable/reference/html/) is a Java code generator specializing in writing\n+conversion or mapping functions between an object instance and an instance of\n+a corresponding object in a class designed for another architectural tier, protocol, or technology.\n+It works mainly by matching types and names via reflection, or using programmer-provided\n+hints where that strategy isn't effective.\n+## Is this a gimmick? Why do I need it?\n+Everything MapStruct does is simple and deterministic, and every programmer has done it before. So why\n+bring in another library and codegen step? What's the advantage?\n+\n+First, by defining a mapper, you're adding some executable documentation to your types, and being\n+explicit about how they should map.\n+ \n+Second, you don't have to rely on developers to perform awkward null\n+checks for every field, as you get that for free. The generated code is very uniform and thus\n+quite readable.\n+\n+Third, and most important, is that once you've defined a mapper, maintenance is very easy. New fields\n+will simply be mapped for you (assuming they exist on both the source and the target type).

Then\n+proceed one property at a time until all the warnings are gone.\n+ \n+### Proofread the generated code\n+First, you should *always* look at the generated code and step through it in the debugger. This is\n+because, while the codegen should be deterministic, most of us don't go around with its order of\n+operator precedence in our head. Particularly if you have many input parameters with multiple fields\n+with common names, you may find that `foo.id` is getting used instead of `bar.id` becase one's a \n+`long` and the other an `int`. Or something. \n+\n+In general, the library gives very reasonable error\n+messages and is very cranky at compile time. This is A Good Thing.\n+\n+## Write tests for mappers\n+It's pretty tedious to write tests for generated code, as the computer is coding faster than you.\n+I still think it's worth it, because,\n+- it documents usage of your generated methods\n+- you catch things the compiler can't (such as when a string format changes)\n+- it's a good opportunity to update old test code\n+- It makes it look less magical\n+\n+### Consider other use cases\n+It's possible to write a mapper from a type to itself and use that as a copy constructor of sorts.\n+\n+### Tune the classes' public APIs\n+If you find yourself writing arcane helper methods, ask yourself if adding a simple setter or\n+getter on one of your classes would make the job easier and the generated code cleaner. Since our\n+model classes are generated, we frequently have to have external helper methods defined in either\n+the mapper class or a utility class.\n+\n+## Handling missing target properties\n+### Avoid `ignore = true` unless absolutely necessary\n+It's annoying to see warnings about missing target properties, and for good reason. The quick way to\n+stifle these is to use the `ignore` parameter, which tells MapStruct to elide the setter code for\n+that target property.\n+```java\n+@Mapping(target = \"billingAccountName\", ignore = true)\n+```\n+\n+While there are some places this is necessary, it should really be a last resort, for a couple of\n+reasons.\n+\n+First, we plan to use mappers to replace existing chunks of code in a clean way. We don't want to\n+have to docment that mapping function X leaves the created object in state Y with respect to fields\n+P, Q, and R. Many of our objects are relatively complex, and it's not obvious when looking at a call\n+to `fooMapper.toModel()` that the output model is incomplete in some way(s).\n+\n+Second, if a target property is difficuult to satisfy, this is a signal that either our class design\n+could be better, or we've left out a prereqisite.\n+\n+One strategy for avoiding unmatched target property is to add parameters to the method specifying\n+them. Then simply specify defaults for those at the call site as appropriate.\n+\n+If the type of the target property has a reasonable defalt (such as zero), and `null` isn't a valid\n+state for it, then using `NullValuePropertyMappingStrategy.SET_TO_DEFAULT` is an option.\n+\n+## Handling Default Values\n+### Handling database defalts\n+If the target class is a Hibernate model, and one or more fields have defaults\n+defined in the database schema, we do not want to overwrite that field with `null`\n+or any defauld value listed in the mapper's annotations.

Why do I need it?\n+Everything MapStruct does is simple and deterministic, and every programmer has done it before. So why\n+bring in another library and codegen step? What's the advantage?\n+\n+First, by defining a mapper, you're adding some executable documentation to your types, and being\n+explicit about how they should map.\n+ \n+Second, you don't have to rely on developers to perform awkward null\n+checks for every field, as you get that for free. The generated code is very uniform and thus\n+quite readable.\n+\n+Third, and most important, is that once you've defined a mapper, maintenance is very easy. New fields\n+will simply be mapped for you (assuming they exist on both the source and the target type). If there's\n+a new target field that doesn't have a sourcce, youll gget a compile-time warning reminding you. (It's\n+important to stay on top of those). \n+\n+### Examples\n+Consider an `EmployeeModel` class:\n+```java\n+public class EmployeeModel {\n+  private String name;\n+  private Department department;\n+  private String address;\n+  private double salary;\n+\n+  public EmployeeModel() {\n+  }\n+\n+  public EmployeeModel(String name,\n+      Department department, String address, double salary) {\n+    this.name = name;\n+    this.department = department;\n+    this.address = address;\n+    this.salary = salary;\n+  }\n+\n+  public String getName() {\n+    return name;\n+  }\n+  public void setName(String name) {\n+    this.name = name;\n+  }\n+\n+  public Department getDepartment() {\n+    return department;\n+  }\n+  public void setDepartment(Department department) {\n+    this.department = department;\n+  }\n+\n+  public double getSalary() {\n+    return salary;\n+  }\n+  public void setSalary(double salary) {\n+    this.salary = salary;\n+  }\n+\n+  public double getWeeklySalary() {\n+    return getSalary() / 52.0;\n+  }\n+\n+  public String getAddress() {\n+    return address;\n+  }\n+\n+  public void setAddress(String address) {\n+    this.address = address;\n+  }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Additionally, we have a (nearly) corresponding entity in the database.

Then\n+proceed one property at a time until all the warnings are gone.\n+ \n+### Proofread the generated code\n+First, you should *always* look at the generated code and step through it in the debugger. This is\n+because, while the codegen should be deterministic, most of us don't go around with its order of\n+operator precedence in our head. Particularly if you have many input parameters with multiple fields\n+with common names, you may find that `foo.id` is getting used instead of `bar.id` becase one's a \n+`long` and the other an `int`. Or something. \n+\n+In general, the library gives very reasonable error\n+messages and is very cranky at compile time. This is A Good Thing.\n+\n+## Write tests for mappers\n+It's pretty tedious to write tests for generated code, as the computer is coding faster than you.\n+I still think it's worth it, because,\n+- it documents usage of your generated methods\n+- you catch things the compiler can't (such as when a string format changes)\n+- it's a good opportunity to update old test code\n+- It makes it look less magical\n+\n+### Consider other use cases\n+It's possible to write a mapper from a type to itself and use that as a copy constructor of sorts.\n+\n+### Tune the classes' public APIs\n+If you find yourself writing arcane helper methods, ask yourself if adding a simple setter or\n+getter on one of your classes would make the job easier and the generated code cleaner. Since our\n+model classes are generated, we frequently have to have external helper methods defined in either\n+the mapper class or a utility class.\n+\n+## Handling missing target properties\n+### Avoid `ignore = true` unless absolutely necessary\n+It's annoying to see warnings about missing target properties, and for good reason. The quick way to\n+stifle these is to use the `ignore` parameter, which tells MapStruct to elide the setter code for\n+that target property.\n+```java\n+@Mapping(target = \"billingAccountName\", ignore = true)\n+```\n+\n+While there are some places this is necessary, it should really be a last resort, for a couple of\n+reasons.\n+\n+First, we plan to use mappers to replace existing chunks of code in a clean way. We don't want to\n+have to docment that mapping function X leaves the created object in state Y with respect to fields\n+P, Q, and R. Many of our objects are relatively complex, and it's not obvious when looking at a call\n+to `fooMapper.toModel()` that the output model is incomplete in some way(s).\n+\n+Second, if a target property is difficuult to satisfy, this is a signal that either our class design\n+could be better, or we've left out a prereqisite.\n+\n+One strategy for avoiding unmatched target property is to add parameters to the method specifying\n+them. Then simply specify defaults for those at the call site as appropriate.\n+\n+If the type of the target property has a reasonable defalt (such as zero), and `null` isn't a valid\n+state for it, then using `NullValuePropertyMappingStrategy.SET_TO_DEFAULT` is an option.\n+\n+## Handling Default Values\n+### Handling database defalts\n+If the target class is a Hibernate model, and one or more fields have defaults\n+defined in the database schema, we do not want to overwrite that field with `null`\n+or any defauld value listed in the mapper's annotations. To get around this, we need\n+to set the `nullValuePropertyMappingStrategy` to `NullValuePropertyMappingStrategy.IGNORE`.\n+This prevents the MapStruct implementation from writing to the target property if the source is null.\n+```java\n+  @Mapping(\n+      source = \"workspace.billingStatus\",\n+      target = \"billingStatus\",\n+      nullValuePropertyMappingStrategy = NullValuePropertyMappingStrategy.IGNORE)\n+```\n+Note that in this case I'm adding an annotation for a field that MapStruct was previously happy\n+to map implicitly to override its defalt behavior.\n+\n+### Specifying a non-default default\n+It's possible to set a default value in the `@Mapping` by\n+using `defaultValue`. This is rarely a good idea, as\n+either the constructor of the target class should be\n+doing this, or the application should specify it. It's mainly\n+useful for dealing with awkward legacy structure that you can't change.\n+\n+One place where this seems to be the least bad option is with\n+the read-only `etag` column in the `workspace` table:\n+```java\n+// Use default CDR version if null. There are really no other good options (i.e. a zero version is just wrong).\n+@Mapping(source = \"workspace.etag\", target = \"version\", qualifiedByName = \"etagToCdrVersion\", defaultValue = \"1\")\n+```\n+## Semi-advanced topics", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "84460942f76b953a05feded4ecc46f5575753e98"}, "originalPosition": 563}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQxOTY1MjI2Ng==", "bodyText": "stratgegies -> strategies", "url": "https://github.com/all-of-us/workbench/pull/3529#discussion_r419652266", "createdAt": "2020-05-04T18:50:04Z", "author": {"login": "als364"}, "path": "api/docs/mapstruct.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,608 @@\n+# MapStruct Best Practices\n+## What is MapStruct?\n+[MapStruct](https://mapstruct.org/documentation/stable/reference/html/) is a Java code generator specializing in writing\n+conversion or mapping functions between an object instance and an instance of\n+a corresponding object in a class designed for another architectural tier, protocol, or technology.\n+It works mainly by matching types and names via reflection, or using programmer-provided\n+hints where that strategy isn't effective.\n+## Is this a gimmick? Why do I need it?\n+Everything MapStruct does is simple and deterministic, and every programmer has done it before. So why\n+bring in another library and codegen step? What's the advantage?\n+\n+First, by defining a mapper, you're adding some executable documentation to your types, and being\n+explicit about how they should map.\n+ \n+Second, you don't have to rely on developers to perform awkward null\n+checks for every field, as you get that for free. The generated code is very uniform and thus\n+quite readable.\n+\n+Third, and most important, is that once you've defined a mapper, maintenance is very easy. New fields\n+will simply be mapped for you (assuming they exist on both the source and the target type). If there's\n+a new target field that doesn't have a sourcce, youll gget a compile-time warning reminding you. (It's\n+important to stay on top of those). \n+\n+### Examples\n+Consider an `EmployeeModel` class:\n+```java\n+public class EmployeeModel {\n+  private String name;\n+  private Department department;\n+  private String address;\n+  private double salary;\n+\n+  public EmployeeModel() {\n+  }\n+\n+  public EmployeeModel(String name,\n+      Department department, String address, double salary) {\n+    this.name = name;\n+    this.department = department;\n+    this.address = address;\n+    this.salary = salary;\n+  }\n+\n+  public String getName() {\n+    return name;\n+  }\n+  public void setName(String name) {\n+    this.name = name;\n+  }\n+\n+  public Department getDepartment() {\n+    return department;\n+  }\n+  public void setDepartment(Department department) {\n+    this.department = department;\n+  }\n+\n+  public double getSalary() {\n+    return salary;\n+  }\n+  public void setSalary(double salary) {\n+    this.salary = salary;\n+  }\n+\n+  public double getWeeklySalary() {\n+    return getSalary() / 52.0;\n+  }\n+\n+  public String getAddress() {\n+    return address;\n+  }\n+\n+  public void setAddress(String address) {\n+    this.address = address;\n+  }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Additionally, we have a (nearly) corresponding entity in the database.

Then\n+proceed one property at a time until all the warnings are gone.\n+ \n+### Proofread the generated code\n+First, you should *always* look at the generated code and step through it in the debugger. This is\n+because, while the codegen should be deterministic, most of us don't go around with its order of\n+operator precedence in our head. Particularly if you have many input parameters with multiple fields\n+with common names, you may find that `foo.id` is getting used instead of `bar.id` becase one's a \n+`long` and the other an `int`. Or something. \n+\n+In general, the library gives very reasonable error\n+messages and is very cranky at compile time. This is A Good Thing.\n+\n+## Write tests for mappers\n+It's pretty tedious to write tests for generated code, as the computer is coding faster than you.\n+I still think it's worth it, because,\n+- it documents usage of your generated methods\n+- you catch things the compiler can't (such as when a string format changes)\n+- it's a good opportunity to update old test code\n+- It makes it look less magical\n+\n+### Consider other use cases\n+It's possible to write a mapper from a type to itself and use that as a copy constructor of sorts.\n+\n+### Tune the classes' public APIs\n+If you find yourself writing arcane helper methods, ask yourself if adding a simple setter or\n+getter on one of your classes would make the job easier and the generated code cleaner. Since our\n+model classes are generated, we frequently have to have external helper methods defined in either\n+the mapper class or a utility class.\n+\n+## Handling missing target properties\n+### Avoid `ignore = true` unless absolutely necessary\n+It's annoying to see warnings about missing target properties, and for good reason. The quick way to\n+stifle these is to use the `ignore` parameter, which tells MapStruct to elide the setter code for\n+that target property.\n+```java\n+@Mapping(target = \"billingAccountName\", ignore = true)\n+```\n+\n+While there are some places this is necessary, it should really be a last resort, for a couple of\n+reasons.\n+\n+First, we plan to use mappers to replace existing chunks of code in a clean way. We don't want to\n+have to docment that mapping function X leaves the created object in state Y with respect to fields\n+P, Q, and R. Many of our objects are relatively complex, and it's not obvious when looking at a call\n+to `fooMapper.toModel()` that the output model is incomplete in some way(s).\n+\n+Second, if a target property is difficuult to satisfy, this is a signal that either our class design\n+could be better, or we've left out a prereqisite.\n+\n+One strategy for avoiding unmatched target property is to add parameters to the method specifying\n+them. Then simply specify defaults for those at the call site as appropriate.\n+\n+If the type of the target property has a reasonable defalt (such as zero), and `null` isn't a valid\n+state for it, then using `NullValuePropertyMappingStrategy.SET_TO_DEFAULT` is an option.\n+\n+## Handling Default Values\n+### Handling database defalts\n+If the target class is a Hibernate model, and one or more fields have defaults\n+defined in the database schema, we do not want to overwrite that field with `null`\n+or any defauld value listed in the mapper's annotations. To get around this, we need\n+to set the `nullValuePropertyMappingStrategy` to `NullValuePropertyMappingStrategy.IGNORE`.\n+This prevents the MapStruct implementation from writing to the target property if the source is null.\n+```java\n+  @Mapping(\n+      source = \"workspace.billingStatus\",\n+      target = \"billingStatus\",\n+      nullValuePropertyMappingStrategy = NullValuePropertyMappingStrategy.IGNORE)\n+```\n+Note that in this case I'm adding an annotation for a field that MapStruct was previously happy\n+to map implicitly to override its defalt behavior.\n+\n+### Specifying a non-default default\n+It's possible to set a default value in the `@Mapping` by\n+using `defaultValue`. This is rarely a good idea, as\n+either the constructor of the target class should be\n+doing this, or the application should specify it. It's mainly\n+useful for dealing with awkward legacy structure that you can't change.\n+\n+One place where this seems to be the least bad option is with\n+the read-only `etag` column in the `workspace` table:\n+```java\n+// Use default CDR version if null. There are really no other good options (i.e. a zero version is just wrong).\n+@Mapping(source = \"workspace.etag\", target = \"version\", qualifiedByName = \"etagToCdrVersion\", defaultValue = \"1\")\n+```\n+## Semi-advanced topics\n+\n+### Mapping to a subset of target properties\n+If you need to map from an object with sub-objects to a target type that's flat, there are two\n+stratgegies.

Why do I need it?\n+Everything MapStruct does is simple and deterministic, and every programmer has done it before. So why\n+bring in another library and codegen step? What's the advantage?\n+\n+First, by defining a mapper, you're adding some executable documentation to your types, and being\n+explicit about how they should map.\n+ \n+Second, you don't have to rely on developers to perform awkward null\n+checks for every field, as you get that for free. The generated code is very uniform and thus\n+quite readable.\n+\n+Third, and most important, is that once you've defined a mapper, maintenance is very easy. New fields\n+will simply be mapped for you (assuming they exist on both the source and the target type). If there's\n+a new target field that doesn't have a sourcce, youll gget a compile-time warning reminding you. (It's\n+important to stay on top of those). \n+\n+### Examples\n+Consider an `EmployeeModel` class:\n+```java\n+public class EmployeeModel {\n+  private String name;\n+  private Department department;\n+  private String address;\n+  private double salary;\n+\n+  public EmployeeModel() {\n+  }\n+\n+  public EmployeeModel(String name,\n+      Department department, String address, double salary) {\n+    this.name = name;\n+    this.department = department;\n+    this.address = address;\n+    this.salary = salary;\n+  }\n+\n+  public String getName() {\n+    return name;\n+  }\n+  public void setName(String name) {\n+    this.name = name;\n+  }\n+\n+  public Department getDepartment() {\n+    return department;\n+  }\n+  public void setDepartment(Department department) {\n+    this.department = department;\n+  }\n+\n+  public double getSalary() {\n+    return salary;\n+  }\n+  public void setSalary(double salary) {\n+    this.salary = salary;\n+  }\n+\n+  public double getWeeklySalary() {\n+    return getSalary() / 52.0;\n+  }\n+\n+  public String getAddress() {\n+    return address;\n+  }\n+\n+  public void setAddress(String address) {\n+    this.address = address;\n+  }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Additionally, we have a (nearly) corresponding entity in the database.

Since our `EmployeeDbEntity` class doesn't have an attribute named `name`\n+(or a `getName()` method), it doesn't just grab any String property from that class and hope for the\n+best. We had to tell it in a `@Mapping` annotation that it can in fact get a `String` called \"name\" from this\n+`employeeDbEntity` if it looks a little harder.\n+\n+Since our default method takes in the entity and returns a string, this is a good candidate, and\n+that's what it uses.\n+\n+What if we hadn't named it `toName()`?

Then\n+proceed one property at a time until all the warnings are gone.\n+ \n+### Proofread the generated code\n+First, you should *always* look at the generated code and step through it in the debugger. This is\n+because, while the codegen should be deterministic, most of us don't go around with its order of\n+operator precedence in our head. Particularly if you have many input parameters with multiple fields\n+with common names, you may find that `foo.id` is getting used instead of `bar.id` becase one's a \n+`long` and the other an `int`. Or something. \n+\n+In general, the library gives very reasonable error\n+messages and is very cranky at compile time. This is A Good Thing.\n+\n+## Write tests for mappers\n+It's pretty tedious to write tests for generated code, as the computer is coding faster than you.\n+I still think it's worth it, because,\n+- it documents usage of your generated methods\n+- you catch things the compiler can't (such as when a string format changes)\n+- it's a good opportunity to update old test code\n+- It makes it look less magical\n+\n+### Consider other use cases\n+It's possible to write a mapper from a type to itself and use that as a copy constructor of sorts.\n+\n+### Tune the classes' public APIs\n+If you find yourself writing arcane helper methods, ask yourself if adding a simple setter or\n+getter on one of your classes would make the job easier and the generated code cleaner. Since our\n+model classes are generated, we frequently have to have external helper methods defined in either\n+the mapper class or a utility class.\n+\n+## Handling missing target properties\n+### Avoid `ignore = true` unless absolutely necessary\n+It's annoying to see warnings about missing target properties, and for good reason. The quick way to\n+stifle these is to use the `ignore` parameter, which tells MapStruct to elide the setter code for\n+that target property.\n+```java\n+@Mapping(target = \"billingAccountName\", ignore = true)\n+```\n+\n+While there are some places this is necessary, it should really be a last resort, for a couple of\n+reasons.\n+\n+First, we plan to use mappers to replace existing chunks of code in a clean way. We don't want to\n+have to docment that mapping function X leaves the created object in state Y with respect to fields\n+P, Q, and R. Many of our objects are relatively complex, and it's not obvious when looking at a call\n+to `fooMapper.toModel()` that the output model is incomplete in some way(s).\n+\n+Second, if a target property is difficuult to satisfy, this is a signal that either our class design\n+could be better, or we've left out a prereqisite.\n+\n+One strategy for avoiding unmatched target property is to add parameters to the method specifying\n+them. Then simply specify defaults for those at the call site as appropriate.\n+\n+If the type of the target property has a reasonable defalt (such as zero), and `null` isn't a valid\n+state for it, then using `NullValuePropertyMappingStrategy.SET_TO_DEFAULT` is an option.\n+\n+## Handling Default Values\n+### Handling database defalts\n+If the target class is a Hibernate model, and one or more fields have defaults\n+defined in the database schema, we do not want to overwrite that field with `null`\n+or any defauld value listed in the mapper's annotations. To get around this, we need\n+to set the `nullValuePropertyMappingStrategy` to `NullValuePropertyMappingStrategy.IGNORE`.\n+This prevents the MapStruct implementation from writing to the target property if the source is null.\n+```java\n+  @Mapping(\n+      source = \"workspace.billingStatus\",\n+      target = \"billingStatus\",\n+      nullValuePropertyMappingStrategy = NullValuePropertyMappingStrategy.IGNORE)\n+```\n+Note that in this case I'm adding an annotation for a field that MapStruct was previously happy\n+to map implicitly to override its defalt behavior.\n+\n+### Specifying a non-default default\n+It's possible to set a default value in the `@Mapping` by\n+using `defaultValue`. This is rarely a good idea, as\n+either the constructor of the target class should be\n+doing this, or the application should specify it. It's mainly\n+useful for dealing with awkward legacy structure that you can't change.\n+\n+One place where this seems to be the least bad option is with\n+the read-only `etag` column in the `workspace` table:\n+```java\n+// Use default CDR version if null. There are really no other good options (i.e. a zero version is just wrong).\n+@Mapping(source = \"workspace.etag\", target = \"version\", qualifiedByName = \"etagToCdrVersion\", defaultValue = \"1\")\n+```\n+## Semi-advanced topics\n+\n+### Mapping to a subset of target properties\n+If you need to map from an object with sub-objects to a target type that's flat, there are two\n+stratgegies. The first is to use dot indexing in the `@Mapping` annotation, for example\n+`@Mapping(source = \"employee.contact.address\", target = \"address\")`. This works well, but the\n+generated code will look sloppy if you have to do this many times (e.g. for ResearchPurpose).\n+If you want to have the address member on the source accessed only once in the mapping (e.g. if it\n+involves some expensive calculation or network call), then it's better to have a separate method\n+using `@MappingTarget` on the target type. Something like the following may work\n+```java\n+default void setAddress(@MappingTarget DbEmployee dbEmployee, EmployeeModel employee) {\n+  dbEmployee.setAddress(employee.address);\n+}\n+```\n+\n+You could also elect to have a setter for this object on the target class itself, but then you may\n+lose some of the benefits of MapStruct's compile-time checking.\n+\n+Finally, note that this hierarchical mismatch may be a design smell.\n+\n+### Pulling in other mappers\n+The `uses` directive instructs MapStruct to look for candidates in external classes. We have one\n+class just for this purpose called `CommonMappers`. Additionally, classes exposing public static\n+methods, such as `DbStorageEnums` can be used to good effect.\n+\n+### Using the `@AfterMapping` annotation\n+Sometimes it's desirable to perform some fixup or post-mapping operations. While this should not be\n+common, it's a handy tool to have around. In the case of target types that are generated from\n+`swagger-codegen`, often the default constructor is lacking. For example it does not initialize\n+array members to empty arrays but leaves them as null. We can fix this with an appropriate\n+after mapping method that initializes those fields if they're not already.\n+\n+### Using DAOs\n+If you specify `componentModel = \"spring\"` in the top-level `@Mapper` annotation, you can inject\n+Spring beans and services. If you go this route, be sure to document and test all side effects. I'm\n+not sure what the convention should be on whether a target Hibernate entity should be saved inside\n+the mapping method or not.\n+\n+## False positive matches\n+Although the rules used in the codegen are reliable, they may not be intuitive when you're dealing\n+with large classes with many similar fields of the same types. In particular for this project,\n+be very careful with various combinations of `Workspace`, `DbWorkspace`, and `FirecloudWorkspace`. \n+- Timestamp vs SqlTimestamp. SqlTimestamp is slightly special, and many of the generated time conversions are not _quite_ what we\n+want.

Why do I need it?\n+Everything MapStruct does is simple and deterministic, and every programmer has done it before. So why\n+bring in another library and codegen step? What's the advantage?\n+\n+First, by defining a mapper, you're adding some executable documentation to your types, and being\n+explicit about how they should map.\n+ \n+Second, you don't have to rely on developers to perform awkward null\n+checks for every field, as you get that for free. The generated code is very uniform and thus\n+quite readable.\n+\n+Third, and most important, is that once you've defined a mapper, maintenance is very easy. New fields\n+will simply be mapped for you (assuming they exist on both the source and the target type). If there's\n+a new target field that doesn't have a sourcce, youll gget a compile-time warning reminding you. (It's\n+important to stay on top of those). \n+\n+### Examples\n+Consider an `EmployeeModel` class:\n+```java\n+public class EmployeeModel {\n+  private String name;\n+  private Department department;\n+  private String address;\n+  private double salary;\n+\n+  public EmployeeModel() {\n+  }\n+\n+  public EmployeeModel(String name,\n+      Department department, String address, double salary) {\n+    this.name = name;\n+    this.department = department;\n+    this.address = address;\n+    this.salary = salary;\n+  }\n+\n+  public String getName() {\n+    return name;\n+  }\n+  public void setName(String name) {\n+    this.name = name;\n+  }\n+\n+  public Department getDepartment() {\n+    return department;\n+  }\n+  public void setDepartment(Department department) {\n+    this.department = department;\n+  }\n+\n+  public double getSalary() {\n+    return salary;\n+  }\n+  public void setSalary(double salary) {\n+    this.salary = salary;\n+  }\n+\n+  public double getWeeklySalary() {\n+    return getSalary() / 52.0;\n+  }\n+\n+  public String getAddress() {\n+    return address;\n+  }\n+\n+  public void setAddress(String address) {\n+    this.address = address;\n+  }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Additionally, we have a (nearly) corresponding entity in the database.

Since our `EmployeeDbEntity` class doesn't have an attribute named `name`\n+(or a `getName()` method), it doesn't just grab any String property from that class and hope for the\n+best. We had to tell it in a `@Mapping` annotation that it can in fact get a `String` called \"name\" from this\n+`employeeDbEntity` if it looks a little harder.\n+\n+Since our default method takes in the entity and returns a string, this is a good candidate, and\n+that's what it uses.\n+\n+What if we hadn't named it `toName()`?

Here's a basic test case for the happy path.\n+If your input class has any nullable parameters or fields on those parameters, or there are any other\n+edge cases, you'd want to test those as well.\n+```java\n+import static com.google.common.truth.Truth.assertThat;\n+\n+import org.junit.Test;\n+import org.junit.runner.RunWith;\n+import org.pmiops.workbench.utils.mappers.examples.Department;\n+import org.pmiops.workbench.utils.mappers.examples.EmployeeDbEntity;\n+import org.pmiops.workbench.utils.mappers.examples.EmployeeMapper;\n+import org.pmiops.workbench.utils.mappers.examples.EmployeeMapperImpl;\n+import org.pmiops.workbench.utils.mappers.examples.EmployeeModel;\n+import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;\n+import org.springframework.boot.test.context.TestConfiguration;\n+import org.springframework.context.annotation.Import;\n+import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;\n+\n+@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)\n+public class EmployeeMapperTest {\n+\n+  public static final String ADDRESS = \"123 Sesame Street\";\n+  @Autowired private EmployeeMapper employeeMapper;\n+\n+  @TestConfiguration\n+  @Import({EmployeeMapperImpl.class})\n+  static class Configuration {}\n+\n+  @Test\n+  public void testToModel() {\n+    final EmployeeDbEntity employeeDbEntity = new EmployeeDbEntity(\"John\", \"Doe\", 2, 3.00, ADDRESS);\n+\n+    final EmployeeModel employeeModel = employeeMapper.toModel(employeeDbEntity);\n+    assertThat(employeeModel.getDepartment()).isEqualTo(Department.IT);\n+    assertThat(employeeModel.getSalary()).isWithin(1.0e-6).of(6000.0);\n+    assertThat(employeeModel.getName()).isEqualTo(\"John Doe\");\n+    assertThat(employeeModel.getAddress()).isEqualTo(ADDRESS);\n+  }\n+}\n+```\n+## Tips & Strategies\n+\n+### Stub it so it builds, and go one property at a time\n+For big target classes, put in some temporary `ignore` statements or other hacks just to get it\n+to the point that it generates the implemmentation class and actually compiles without errors. Then\n+proceed one property at a time until all the warnings are gone.\n+ \n+### Proofread the generated code\n+First, you should *always* look at the generated code and step through it in the debugger. This is\n+because, while the codegen should be deterministic, most of us don't go around with its order of\n+operator precedence in our head. Particularly if you have many input parameters with multiple fields\n+with common names, you may find that `foo.id` is getting used instead of `bar.id` becase one's a \n+`long` and the other an `int`. Or something. \n+\n+In general, the library gives very reasonable error\n+messages and is very cranky at compile time. This is A Good Thing.\n+\n+## Write tests for mappers\n+It's pretty tedious to write tests for generated code, as the computer is coding faster than you.\n+I still think it's worth it, because,\n+- it documents usage of your generated methods\n+- you catch things the compiler can't (such as when a string format changes)\n+- it's a good opportunity to update old test code\n+- It makes it look less magical\n+\n+### Consider other use cases\n+It's possible to write a mapper from a type to itself and use that as a copy constructor of sorts.\n+\n+### Tune the classes' public APIs\n+If you find yourself writing arcane helper methods, ask yourself if adding a simple setter or\n+getter on one of your classes would make the job easier and the generated code cleaner. Since our\n+model classes are generated, we frequently have to have external helper methods defined in either\n+the mapper class or a utility class.\n+\n+## Handling missing target properties\n+### Avoid `ignore = true` unless absolutely necessary\n+It's annoying to see warnings about missing target properties, and for good reason. The quick way to\n+stifle these is to use the `ignore` parameter, which tells MapStruct to elide the setter code for\n+that target property.\n+```java\n+@Mapping(target = \"billingAccountName\", ignore = true)\n+```\n+\n+While there are some places this is necessary, it should really be a last resort, for a couple of\n+reasons.\n+\n+First, we plan to use mappers to replace existing chunks of code in a clean way. We don't want to\n+have to docment that mapping function X leaves the created object in state Y with respect to fields\n+P, Q, and R. Many of our objects are relatively complex, and it's not obvious when looking at a call\n+to `fooMapper.toModel()` that the output model is incomplete in some way(s).\n+\n+Second, if a target property is difficuult to satisfy, this is a signal that either our class design\n+could be better, or we've left out a prereqisite.\n+\n+One strategy for avoiding unmatched target property is to add parameters to the method specifying\n+them. Then simply specify defaults for those at the call site as appropriate.\n+\n+If the type of the target property has a reasonable defalt (such as zero), and `null` isn't a valid\n+state for it, then using `NullValuePropertyMappingStrategy.SET_TO_DEFAULT` is an option.\n+\n+## Handling Default Values\n+### Handling database defalts\n+If the target class is a Hibernate model, and one or more fields have defaults\n+defined in the database schema, we do not want to overwrite that field with `null`\n+or any defauld value listed in the mapper's annotations. To get around this, we need\n+to set the `nullValuePropertyMappingStrategy` to `NullValuePropertyMappingStrategy.IGNORE`.\n+This prevents the MapStruct implementation from writing to the target property if the source is null.\n+```java\n+  @Mapping(\n+      source = \"workspace.billingStatus\",\n+      target = \"billingStatus\",\n+      nullValuePropertyMappingStrategy = NullValuePropertyMappingStrategy.IGNORE)\n+```\n+Note that in this case I'm adding an annotation for a field that MapStruct was previously happy\n+to map implicitly to override its defalt behavior.\n+\n+### Specifying a non-default default\n+It's possible to set a default value in the `@Mapping` by\n+using `defaultValue`. This is rarely a good idea, as\n+either the constructor of the target class should be\n+doing this, or the application should specify it. It's mainly\n+useful for dealing with awkward legacy structure that you can't change.\n+\n+One place where this seems to be the least bad option is with\n+the read-only `etag` column in the `workspace` table:\n+```java\n+// Use default CDR version if null. There are really no other good options (i.e. a zero version is just wrong).\n+@Mapping(source = \"workspace.etag\", target = \"version\", qualifiedByName = \"etagToCdrVersion\", defaultValue = \"1\")\n+```\n+## Semi-advanced topics", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQxOTY1MjIxMQ=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "84460942f76b953a05feded4ecc46f5575753e98"}, "originalPosition": 563}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDA2ODExODU2", "url": "https://github.com/all-of-us/workbench/pull/3529#pullrequestreview-406811856", "createdAt": "2020-05-06T17:02:14Z", "commit": {"oid": "84460942f76b953a05feded4ecc46f5575753e98"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 7, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNS0wNlQxNzowMjoxNFrOGRcpgw==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNS0wNlQxODo1MjowN1rOGRg3Qw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyMDk0ODM1NQ==", "bodyText": "move below CircleCI", "url": "https://github.com/all-of-us/workbench/pull/3529#discussion_r420948355", "createdAt": "2020-05-06T17:02:14Z", "author": {"login": "jmthibault79"}, "path": "README.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -1,11 +1,14 @@\n # Workbench\n \n-[![CircleCI Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/all-of-us/workbench.svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/all-of-us/workflows/workbench)\n+## Development Guides", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "84460942f76b953a05feded4ecc46f5575753e98"}, "originalPosition": 4}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyMDk1MzQ1Mg==", "bodyText": "awkward wording here.

Why do I need it?\n+Everything MapStruct does is simple and deterministic, and every programmer has done it before. So why\n+bring in another library and codegen step? What's the advantage?\n+\n+First, by defining a mapper, you're adding some executable documentation to your types, and being\n+explicit about how they should map.\n+ \n+Second, you don't have to rely on developers to perform awkward null\n+checks for every field, as you get that for free. The generated code is very uniform and thus\n+quite readable.\n+\n+Third, and most important, is that once you've defined a mapper, maintenance is very easy. New fields\n+will simply be mapped for you (assuming they exist on both the source and the target type). If there's\n+a new target field that doesn't have a sourcce, youll gget a compile-time warning reminding you. (It's\n+important to stay on top of those). \n+\n+### Examples\n+Consider an `EmployeeModel` class:\n+```java\n+public class EmployeeModel {\n+  private String name;\n+  private Department department;\n+  private String address;\n+  private double salary;\n+\n+  public EmployeeModel() {\n+  }\n+\n+  public EmployeeModel(String name,\n+      Department department, String address, double salary) {\n+    this.name = name;\n+    this.department = department;\n+    this.address = address;\n+    this.salary = salary;\n+  }\n+\n+  public String getName() {\n+    return name;\n+  }\n+  public void setName(String name) {\n+    this.name = name;\n+  }\n+\n+  public Department getDepartment() {\n+    return department;\n+  }\n+  public void setDepartment(Department department) {\n+    this.department = department;\n+  }\n+\n+  public double getSalary() {\n+    return salary;\n+  }\n+  public void setSalary(double salary) {\n+    this.salary = salary;\n+  }\n+\n+  public double getWeeklySalary() {\n+    return getSalary() / 52.0;\n+  }\n+\n+  public String getAddress() {\n+    return address;\n+  }\n+\n+  public void setAddress(String address) {\n+    this.address = address;\n+  }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Additionally, we have a (nearly) corresponding entity in the database. (Hibernate bindings omitted.)\n+```java\n+// ORM details omitted.\n+public class EmployeeDbEntity {\n+\n+  private String firstName;\n+  private String lastName;\n+  private int departmentCode; // corresponds to enum\n+  private double hourlyRate;\n+  private String address;\n+\n+  public EmployeeDbEntity(String firstName, String lastName, int departmentCode, double hourlyRate,\n+      String address) {\n+    this.firstName = firstName;\n+    this.lastName = lastName;\n+    this.departmentCode = departmentCode;\n+    this.hourlyRate = hourlyRate;\n+    this.address = address;\n+  }\n+\n+  public String getFirstName() {\n+    return firstName;\n+  }\n+  public void setFirstName(String firstName) {\n+    this.firstName = firstName;\n+  }\n+\n+  public int getDepartmentCode() {\n+    return departmentCode;\n+  }\n+  public void setDepartmentCode(int departmentCode) {\n+    this.departmentCode = departmentCode;\n+  }\n+\n+  public double getHourlyRate() {\n+    return hourlyRate;\n+  }\n+  public void setHourlyRate(double hourlyRate) {\n+    this.hourlyRate = hourlyRate;\n+  }\n+\n+  public String getLastName() {\n+    return lastName;\n+  }\n+  public void setLastName(String lastName) {\n+    this.lastName = lastName;\n+  }\n+\n+  public String getAddress() {\n+    return address;\n+  }\n+  public void setAddress(String address) {\n+    this.address = address;\n+  }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+A naive first cut at a mapping function might look like this:\n+```java\n+import org.mapstruct.Mapper;\n+\n+@Mapper\n+public interface EmployeeMapper {\n+\n+  EmployeeModel toModel(EmployeeDbEntity employeeDbEntity);\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Using `./gradlew compileJava`, I see that this compiles, but gives warnings\n+```\n+examples/EmployeeMapper.java:8: warning: Unmapped target properties: \"name, department, salary\".\n+  EmployeeModel toModel(EmployeeDbEntity employeeDbEntity);\n+                ^\n+```\n+\n+So the good news is I've successfully generated a mapper.

Let's pretend our\n+system didn't already have a good one, and add it directly in the mapper itself for brevity. To do\n+this, we need to create a `default` method on the interface, which is a relatively new facility in\n+Java to make life easier in this kind of situation.\n+\n+Our default method is itself another mapper, though you want to be careful when the source type of\n+such a mapper is a common type like String or Timestamp.\n+\n+```java\n+@Mapper\n+public interface EmployeeMapper {\n+\n+  @Mapping(source = \"employeeDbEntity\", target = \"name\")\n+  EmployeeModel toModel(EmployeeDbEntity employeeDbEntity);\n+\n+  default String toName(EmployeeDbEntity employeeDbEntity) {\n+    return String.format(\"%s %s\", employeeDbEntity.getFirstName(), employeeDbEntity.getLastName());\n+  }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+On compiling this, we have a shorter error message:\n+```\n+EmployeeMapper.java:11: warning: Unmapped target properties: \"department, salary\".\n+```\n+\n+Our generated implementation class now looks like this:\n+```java\n+public class EmployeeMapperImpl implements EmployeeMapper {\n+\n+    @Override\n+    public EmployeeModel toModel(EmployeeDbEntity employeeDbEntity) {\n+        if ( employeeDbEntity == null ) {\n+            return null;\n+        }\n+\n+        EmployeeModel employeeModel = new EmployeeModel();\n+\n+        employeeModel.setName( toName( employeeDbEntity ) ); // <-- our default mapper method\n+        employeeModel.setAddress( employeeDbEntity.getAddress() );\n+\n+        return employeeModel;\n+    }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+If you're following along, notice that MapStruct is being clever here, but not too clever\n+(by design). Since our `EmployeeDbEntity` class doesn't have an attribute named `name`\n+(or a `getName()` method), it doesn't just grab any String property from that class and hope for the\n+best. We had to tell it in a `@Mapping` annotation that it can in fact get a `String` called \"name\" from this\n+`employeeDbEntity` if it looks a little harder.\n+\n+Since our default method takes in the entity and returns a string, this is a good candidate, and\n+that's what it uses.\n+\n+What if we hadn't named it `toName()`?

Then\n+proceed one property at a time until all the warnings are gone.\n+ \n+### Proofread the generated code\n+First, you should *always* look at the generated code and step through it in the debugger. This is\n+because, while the codegen should be deterministic, most of us don't go around with its order of\n+operator precedence in our head. Particularly if you have many input parameters with multiple fields\n+with common names, you may find that `foo.id` is getting used instead of `bar.id` becase one's a \n+`long` and the other an `int`. Or something. \n+\n+In general, the library gives very reasonable error\n+messages and is very cranky at compile time.

Why do I need it?\n+Everything MapStruct does is simple and deterministic, and every programmer has done it before. So why\n+bring in another library and codegen step? What's the advantage?\n+\n+First, by defining a mapper, you're adding some executable documentation to your types, and being\n+explicit about how they should map.\n+ \n+Second, you don't have to rely on developers to perform awkward null\n+checks for every field, as you get that for free. The generated code is very uniform and thus\n+quite readable.\n+\n+Third, and most important, is that once you've defined a mapper, maintenance is very easy. New fields\n+will simply be mapped for you (assuming they exist on both the source and the target type). If there's\n+a new target field that doesn't have a sourcce, youll gget a compile-time warning reminding you. (It's\n+important to stay on top of those). \n+\n+### Examples\n+Consider an `EmployeeModel` class:\n+```java\n+public class EmployeeModel {\n+  private String name;\n+  private Department department;\n+  private String address;\n+  private double salary;\n+\n+  public EmployeeModel() {\n+  }\n+\n+  public EmployeeModel(String name,\n+      Department department, String address, double salary) {\n+    this.name = name;\n+    this.department = department;\n+    this.address = address;\n+    this.salary = salary;\n+  }\n+\n+  public String getName() {\n+    return name;\n+  }\n+  public void setName(String name) {\n+    this.name = name;\n+  }\n+\n+  public Department getDepartment() {\n+    return department;\n+  }\n+  public void setDepartment(Department department) {\n+    this.department = department;\n+  }\n+\n+  public double getSalary() {\n+    return salary;\n+  }\n+  public void setSalary(double salary) {\n+    this.salary = salary;\n+  }\n+\n+  public double getWeeklySalary() {\n+    return getSalary() / 52.0;\n+  }\n+\n+  public String getAddress() {\n+    return address;\n+  }\n+\n+  public void setAddress(String address) {\n+    this.address = address;\n+  }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Additionally, we have a (nearly) corresponding entity in the database.

Since our `EmployeeDbEntity` class doesn't have an attribute named `name`\n+(or a `getName()` method), it doesn't just grab any String property from that class and hope for the\n+best. We had to tell it in a `@Mapping` annotation that it can in fact get a `String` called \"name\" from this\n+`employeeDbEntity` if it looks a little harder.\n+\n+Since our default method takes in the entity and returns a string, this is a good candidate, and\n+that's what it uses.\n+\n+What if we hadn't named it `toName()`? I tried that just now and the answer was slightly surprising:\n+it generated a line like `employeeModel.setName( toNickname( employeeDbEntity ) );`. I, for one,\n+welcome our new automatically programmed overlords.\n+\n+We have two more properties to fix: the enum `department`, and the `double salary`. Let's start with\n+the enum.

Then\n+proceed one property at a time until all the warnings are gone.\n+ \n+### Proofread the generated code\n+First, you should *always* look at the generated code and step through it in the debugger. This is\n+because, while the codegen should be deterministic, most of us don't go around with its order of\n+operator precedence in our head. Particularly if you have many input parameters with multiple fields\n+with common names, you may find that `foo.id` is getting used instead of `bar.id` becase one's a \n+`long` and the other an `int`. Or something. \n+\n+In general, the library gives very reasonable error\n+messages and is very cranky at compile time.

The quick way to\n+stifle these is to use the `ignore` parameter, which tells MapStruct to elide the setter code for\n+that target property.\n+```java\n+@Mapping(target = \"billingAccountName\", ignore = true)\n+```\n+\n+While there are some places this is necessary, it should really be a last resort, for a couple of\n+reasons.\n+\n+First, we plan to use mappers to replace existing chunks of code in a clean way. We don't want to\n+have to docment that mapping function X leaves the created object in state Y with respect to fields\n+P, Q, and R. Many of our objects are relatively complex, and it's not obvious when looking at a call\n+to `fooMapper.toModel()` that the output model is incomplete in some way(s).\n+\n+Second, if a target property is difficuult to satisfy, this is a signal that either our class design\n+could be better, or we've left out a prereqisite.\n+\n+One strategy for avoiding unmatched target property is to add parameters to the method specifying\n+them. Then simply specify defaults for those at the call site as appropriate.\n+\n+If the type of the target property has a reasonable defalt (such as zero), and `null` isn't a valid\n+state for it, then using `NullValuePropertyMappingStrategy.SET_TO_DEFAULT` is an option.\n+\n+## Handling Default Values\n+### Handling database defalts\n+If the target class is a Hibernate model, and one or more fields have defaults\n+defined in the database schema, we do not want to overwrite that field with `null`\n+or any defauld value listed in the mapper's annotations. To get around this, we need\n+to set the `nullValuePropertyMappingStrategy` to `NullValuePropertyMappingStrategy.IGNORE`.\n+This prevents the MapStruct implementation from writing to the target property if the source is null.\n+```java\n+  @Mapping(\n+      source = \"workspace.billingStatus\",\n+      target = \"billingStatus\",\n+      nullValuePropertyMappingStrategy = NullValuePropertyMappingStrategy.IGNORE)\n+```\n+Note that in this case I'm adding an annotation for a field that MapStruct was previously happy\n+to map implicitly to override its defalt behavior.\n+\n+### Specifying a non-default default\n+It's possible to set a default value in the `@Mapping` by\n+using `defaultValue`. This is rarely a good idea, as\n+either the constructor of the target class should be\n+doing this, or the application should specify it. It's mainly\n+useful for dealing with awkward legacy structure that you can't change.\n+\n+One place where this seems to be the least bad option is with\n+the read-only `etag` column in the `workspace` table:\n+```java\n+// Use default CDR version if null. There are really no other good options (i.e. a zero version is just wrong).\n+@Mapping(source = \"workspace.etag\", target = \"version\", qualifiedByName = \"etagToCdrVersion\", defaultValue = \"1\")\n+```\n+## Semi-advanced topics\n+\n+### Mapping to a subset of target properties\n+If you need to map from an object with sub-objects to a target type that's flat, there are two\n+stratgegies. The first is to use dot indexing in the `@Mapping` annotation, for example\n+`@Mapping(source = \"employee.contact.address\", target = \"address\")`. This works well, but the\n+generated code will look sloppy if you have to do this many times (e.g. for ResearchPurpose).\n+If you want to have the address member on the source accessed only once in the mapping (e.g. if it\n+involves some expensive calculation or network call), then it's better to have a separate method\n+using `@MappingTarget` on the target type.

Why do I need it?\n+Everything MapStruct does is simple and deterministic, and every programmer has done it before. So why\n+bring in another library and codegen step? What's the advantage?\n+\n+First, by defining a mapper, you're adding some executable documentation to your types, and being\n+explicit about how they should map.\n+ \n+Second, you don't have to rely on developers to perform awkward null\n+checks for every field, as you get that for free. The generated code is very uniform and thus\n+quite readable.\n+\n+Third, and most important, is that once you've defined a mapper, maintenance is very easy. New fields\n+will simply be mapped for you (assuming they exist on both the source and the target type). If there's\n+a new target field that doesn't have a sourcce, youll gget a compile-time warning reminding you. (It's\n+important to stay on top of those). \n+\n+### Examples\n+Consider an `EmployeeModel` class:\n+```java\n+public class EmployeeModel {\n+  private String name;\n+  private Department department;\n+  private String address;\n+  private double salary;\n+\n+  public EmployeeModel() {\n+  }\n+\n+  public EmployeeModel(String name,\n+      Department department, String address, double salary) {\n+    this.name = name;\n+    this.department = department;\n+    this.address = address;\n+    this.salary = salary;\n+  }\n+\n+  public String getName() {\n+    return name;\n+  }\n+  public void setName(String name) {\n+    this.name = name;\n+  }\n+\n+  public Department getDepartment() {\n+    return department;\n+  }\n+  public void setDepartment(Department department) {\n+    this.department = department;\n+  }\n+\n+  public double getSalary() {\n+    return salary;\n+  }\n+  public void setSalary(double salary) {\n+    this.salary = salary;\n+  }\n+\n+  public double getWeeklySalary() {\n+    return getSalary() / 52.0;\n+  }\n+\n+  public String getAddress() {\n+    return address;\n+  }\n+\n+  public void setAddress(String address) {\n+    this.address = address;\n+  }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Additionally, we have a (nearly) corresponding entity in the database.

Let's pretend our\n+system didn't already have a good one, and add it directly in the mapper itself for brevity. To do\n+this, we need to create a `default` method on the interface, which is a relatively new facility in\n+Java to make life easier in this kind of situation.\n+\n+Our default method is itself another mapper, though you want to be careful when the source type of\n+such a mapper is a common type like String or Timestamp.\n+\n+```java\n+@Mapper\n+public interface EmployeeMapper {\n+\n+  @Mapping(source = \"employeeDbEntity\", target = \"name\")\n+  EmployeeModel toModel(EmployeeDbEntity employeeDbEntity);\n+\n+  default String toName(EmployeeDbEntity employeeDbEntity) {\n+    return String.format(\"%s %s\", employeeDbEntity.getFirstName(), employeeDbEntity.getLastName());\n+  }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+On compiling this, we have a shorter error message:\n+```\n+EmployeeMapper.java:11: warning: Unmapped target properties: \"department, salary\".\n+```\n+\n+Our generated implementation class now looks like this:\n+```java\n+public class EmployeeMapperImpl implements EmployeeMapper {\n+\n+    @Override\n+    public EmployeeModel toModel(EmployeeDbEntity employeeDbEntity) {\n+        if ( employeeDbEntity == null ) {\n+            return null;\n+        }\n+\n+        EmployeeModel employeeModel = new EmployeeModel();\n+\n+        employeeModel.setName( toName( employeeDbEntity ) ); // <-- our default mapper method\n+        employeeModel.setAddress( employeeDbEntity.getAddress() );\n+\n+        return employeeModel;\n+    }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+If you're following along, notice that MapStruct is being clever here, but not too clever\n+(by design). Since our `EmployeeDbEntity` class doesn't have an attribute named `name`\n+(or a `getName()` method), it doesn't just grab any String property from that class and hope for the\n+best. We had to tell it in a `@Mapping` annotation that it can in fact get a `String` called \"name\" from this\n+`employeeDbEntity` if it looks a little harder.\n+\n+Since our default method takes in the entity and returns a string, this is a good candidate, and\n+that's what it uses.\n+\n+What if we hadn't named it `toName()`? I tried that just now and the answer was slightly surprising:\n+it generated a line like `employeeModel.setName( toNickname( employeeDbEntity ) );`. I, for one,\n+welcome our new automatically programmed overlords.\n+\n+We have two more properties to fix: the enum `department`, and the `double salary`. Let's start with\n+the enum. It's class definition looks like this:\n+```java\n+public enum Department {\n+  SALES(0),\n+  MARKETING(1),\n+  IT(2);\n+\n+  private int departmentCode;\n+\n+  Department(int departmentCode) {\n+    this.departmentCode = departmentCode;\n+  }\n+\n+  public int getDepartmentCode() {\n+    return departmentCode;\n+  }\n+\n+  public static Department fromDepartmentCode(int code) {\n+    switch(code) {\n+      case 0:\n+        return SALES;\n+      case 1:\n+        return MARKETING;\n+      case 2:\n+        return IT;\n+      default:\n+        return SALES; // they never know their code, so probably them\n+    }\n+  }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+I thought I'd be clever and just pull in the enum type via a `uses` directive at the top of the mapper:\n+```java\n+@Mapper(uses = Department.class)\n+```\n+This did exactly the wrong thing.

Why do I need it?\n+Everything MapStruct does is simple and deterministic, and every programmer has done it before. So why\n+bring in another library and codegen step? What's the advantage?\n+\n+First, by defining a mapper, you're adding some executable documentation to your types, and being\n+explicit about how they should map.\n+ \n+Second, you don't have to rely on developers to perform awkward null\n+checks for every field, as you get that for free. The generated code is very uniform and thus\n+quite readable.\n+\n+Third, and most important, is that once you've defined a mapper, maintenance is very easy. New fields\n+will simply be mapped for you (assuming they exist on both the source and the target type). If there's\n+a new target field that doesn't have a sourcce, youll gget a compile-time warning reminding you. (It's\n+important to stay on top of those). \n+\n+### Examples\n+Consider an `EmployeeModel` class:\n+```java\n+public class EmployeeModel {\n+  private String name;\n+  private Department department;\n+  private String address;\n+  private double salary;\n+\n+  public EmployeeModel() {\n+  }\n+\n+  public EmployeeModel(String name,\n+      Department department, String address, double salary) {\n+    this.name = name;\n+    this.department = department;\n+    this.address = address;\n+    this.salary = salary;\n+  }\n+\n+  public String getName() {\n+    return name;\n+  }\n+  public void setName(String name) {\n+    this.name = name;\n+  }\n+\n+  public Department getDepartment() {\n+    return department;\n+  }\n+  public void setDepartment(Department department) {\n+    this.department = department;\n+  }\n+\n+  public double getSalary() {\n+    return salary;\n+  }\n+  public void setSalary(double salary) {\n+    this.salary = salary;\n+  }\n+\n+  public double getWeeklySalary() {\n+    return getSalary() / 52.0;\n+  }\n+\n+  public String getAddress() {\n+    return address;\n+  }\n+\n+  public void setAddress(String address) {\n+    this.address = address;\n+  }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Additionally, we have a (nearly) corresponding entity in the database.

Why do I need it?\n+Everything MapStruct does is simple and deterministic, and every programmer has done it before. So why\n+bring in another library and codegen step? What's the advantage?\n+\n+First, by defining a mapper, you're adding some executable documentation to your types, and being\n+explicit about how they should map.\n+ \n+Second, you don't have to rely on developers to perform awkward null\n+checks for every field, as you get that for free. The generated code is very uniform and thus\n+quite readable.\n+\n+Third, and most important, is that once you've defined a mapper, maintenance is very easy. New fields\n+will simply be mapped for you (assuming they exist on both the source and the target type). If there's\n+a new target field that doesn't have a sourcce, youll gget a compile-time warning reminding you. (It's\n+important to stay on top of those). \n+\n+### Examples\n+Consider an `EmployeeModel` class:\n+```java\n+public class EmployeeModel {\n+  private String name;\n+  private Department department;\n+  private String address;\n+  private double salary;\n+\n+  public EmployeeModel() {\n+  }\n+\n+  public EmployeeModel(String name,\n+      Department department, String address, double salary) {\n+    this.name = name;\n+    this.department = department;\n+    this.address = address;\n+    this.salary = salary;\n+  }\n+\n+  public String getName() {\n+    return name;\n+  }\n+  public void setName(String name) {\n+    this.name = name;\n+  }\n+\n+  public Department getDepartment() {\n+    return department;\n+  }\n+  public void setDepartment(Department department) {\n+    this.department = department;\n+  }\n+\n+  public double getSalary() {\n+    return salary;\n+  }\n+  public void setSalary(double salary) {\n+    this.salary = salary;\n+  }\n+\n+  public double getWeeklySalary() {\n+    return getSalary() / 52.0;\n+  }\n+\n+  public String getAddress() {\n+    return address;\n+  }\n+\n+  public void setAddress(String address) {\n+    this.address = address;\n+  }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Additionally, we have a (nearly) corresponding entity in the database.

Let's pretend our\n+system didn't already have a good one, and add it directly in the mapper itself for brevity. To do\n+this, we need to create a `default` method on the interface, which is a relatively new facility in\n+Java to make life easier in this kind of situation.\n+\n+Our default method is itself another mapper, though you want to be careful when the source type of\n+such a mapper is a common type like String or Timestamp.\n+\n+```java\n+@Mapper\n+public interface EmployeeMapper {\n+\n+  @Mapping(source = \"employeeDbEntity\", target = \"name\")\n+  EmployeeModel toModel(EmployeeDbEntity employeeDbEntity);\n+\n+  default String toName(EmployeeDbEntity employeeDbEntity) {\n+    return String.format(\"%s %s\", employeeDbEntity.getFirstName(), employeeDbEntity.getLastName());\n+  }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+On compiling this, we have a shorter error message:\n+```\n+EmployeeMapper.java:11: warning: Unmapped target properties: \"department, salary\".\n+```\n+\n+Our generated implementation class now looks like this:\n+```java\n+public class EmployeeMapperImpl implements EmployeeMapper {\n+\n+    @Override\n+    public EmployeeModel toModel(EmployeeDbEntity employeeDbEntity) {\n+        if ( employeeDbEntity == null ) {\n+            return null;\n+        }\n+\n+        EmployeeModel employeeModel = new EmployeeModel();\n+\n+        employeeModel.setName( toName( employeeDbEntity ) ); // <-- our default mapper method\n+        employeeModel.setAddress( employeeDbEntity.getAddress() );\n+\n+        return employeeModel;\n+    }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+If you're following along, notice that MapStruct is being clever here, but not too clever\n+(by design). Since our `EmployeeDbEntity` class doesn't have an attribute named `name`\n+(or a `getName()` method), it doesn't just grab any String property from that class and hope for the\n+best. We had to tell it in a `@Mapping` annotation that it can in fact get a `String` called \"name\" from this\n+`employeeDbEntity` if it looks a little harder.\n+\n+Since our default method takes in the entity and returns a string, this is a good candidate, and\n+that's what it uses.\n+\n+What if we hadn't named it `toName()`? I tried that just now and the answer was slightly surprising:\n+it generated a line like `employeeModel.setName( toNickname( employeeDbEntity ) );`. I, for one,\n+welcome our new automatically programmed overlords.\n+\n+We have two more properties to fix: the enum `department`, and the `double salary`. Let's start with\n+the enum. It's class definition looks like this:\n+```java\n+public enum Department {\n+  SALES(0),\n+  MARKETING(1),\n+  IT(2);\n+\n+  private int departmentCode;\n+\n+  Department(int departmentCode) {\n+    this.departmentCode = departmentCode;\n+  }\n+\n+  public int getDepartmentCode() {\n+    return departmentCode;\n+  }\n+\n+  public static Department fromDepartmentCode(int code) {\n+    switch(code) {\n+      case 0:\n+        return SALES;\n+      case 1:\n+        return MARKETING;\n+      case 2:\n+        return IT;\n+      default:\n+        return SALES; // they never know their code, so probably them\n+    }\n+  }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+I thought I'd be clever and just pull in the enum type via a `uses` directive at the top of the mapper:\n+```java\n+@Mapper(uses = Department.class)\n+```\n+This did exactly the wrong thing.

Since our\n+model classes are generated, we frequently have to have external helper methods defined in either\n+the mapper class or a utility class.\n+\n+## Handling missing target properties\n+### Avoid `ignore = true` unless absolutely necessary\n+It's annoying to see warnings about missing target properties, and for good reason. The quick way to\n+stifle these is to use the `ignore` parameter, which tells MapStruct to elide the setter code for\n+that target property.\n+```java\n+@Mapping(target = \"billingAccountName\", ignore = true)\n+```\n+\n+While there are some places this is necessary, it should really be a last resort, for a couple of\n+reasons.\n+\n+First, we plan to use mappers to replace existing chunks of code in a clean way. We don't want to\n+have to docment that mapping function X leaves the created object in state Y with respect to fields\n+P, Q, and R. Many of our objects are relatively complex, and it's not obvious when looking at a call\n+to `fooMapper.toModel()` that the output model is incomplete in some way(s).\n+\n+Second, if a target property is difficuult to satisfy, this is a signal that either our class design\n+could be better, or we've left out a prereqisite.\n+\n+One strategy for avoiding unmatched target property is to add parameters to the method specifying\n+them. Then simply specify defaults for those at the call site as appropriate.\n+\n+If the type of the target property has a reasonable defalt (such as zero), and `null` isn't a valid\n+state for it, then using `NullValuePropertyMappingStrategy.SET_TO_DEFAULT` is an option.\n+\n+## Handling Default Values\n+### Handling database defalts\n+If the target class is a Hibernate model, and one or more fields have defaults\n+defined in the database schema, we do not want to overwrite that field with `null`\n+or any defauld value listed in the mapper's annotations. To get around this, we need\n+to set the `nullValuePropertyMappingStrategy` to `NullValuePropertyMappingStrategy.IGNORE`.\n+This prevents the MapStruct implementation from writing to the target property if the source is null.\n+```java\n+  @Mapping(\n+      source = \"workspace.billingStatus\",\n+      target = \"billingStatus\",\n+      nullValuePropertyMappingStrategy = NullValuePropertyMappingStrategy.IGNORE)\n+```\n+Note that in this case I'm adding an annotation for a field that MapStruct was previously happy\n+to map implicitly to override its defalt behavior.\n+\n+### Specifying a non-default default\n+It's possible to set a default value in the `@Mapping` by\n+using `defaultValue`. This is rarely a good idea, as\n+either the constructor of the target class should be\n+doing this, or the application should specify it. It's mainly\n+useful for dealing with awkward legacy structure that you can't change.\n+\n+One place where this seems to be the least bad option is with\n+the read-only `etag` column in the `workspace` table:\n+```java\n+// Use default CDR version if null. There are really no other good options (i.e. a zero version is just wrong).\n+@Mapping(source = \"workspace.etag\", target = \"version\", qualifiedByName = \"etagToCdrVersion\", defaultValue = \"1\")\n+```\n+## Semi-advanced topics\n+\n+### Mapping to a subset of target properties\n+If you need to map from an object with sub-objects to a target type that's flat, there are two\n+stratgegies. The first is to use dot indexing in the `@Mapping` annotation, for example\n+`@Mapping(source = \"employee.contact.address\", target = \"address\")`. This works well, but the\n+generated code will look sloppy if you have to do this many times (e.g. for ResearchPurpose).\n+If you want to have the address member on the source accessed only once in the mapping (e.g. if it\n+involves some expensive calculation or network call), then it's better to have a separate method\n+using `@MappingTarget` on the target type. Something like the following may work\n+```java\n+default void setAddress(@MappingTarget DbEmployee dbEmployee, EmployeeModel employee) {\n+  dbEmployee.setAddress(employee.address);\n+}\n+```\n+\n+You could also elect to have a setter for this object on the target class itself, but then you may\n+lose some of the benefits of MapStruct's compile-time checking.\n+\n+Finally, note that this hierarchical mismatch may be a design smell.\n+\n+### Pulling in other mappers\n+The `uses` directive instructs MapStruct to look for candidates in external classes. We have one\n+class just for this purpose called `CommonMappers`. Additionally, classes exposing public static\n+methods, such as `DbStorageEnums` can be used to good effect.\n+\n+### Using the `@AfterMapping` annotation\n+Sometimes it's desirable to perform some fixup or post-mapping operations. While this should not be\n+common, it's a handy tool to have around. In the case of target types that are generated from\n+`swagger-codegen`, often the default constructor is lacking. For example it does not initialize\n+array members to empty arrays but leaves them as null. We can fix this with an appropriate\n+after mapping method that initializes those fields if they're not already.\n+\n+### Using DAOs", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyMTExMDIxOA=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "84460942f76b953a05feded4ecc46f5575753e98"}, "originalPosition": 596}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDA4NDAyNjI1", "url": "https://github.com/all-of-us/workbench/pull/3529#pullrequestreview-408402625", "createdAt": "2020-05-08T17:36:46Z", "commit": {"oid": "4d876497eea125cd35a6d28e7c226fe0135d795a"}, "state": "APPROVED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNS0wOFQxNzozNjo0NlrOGStnPg==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNS0wOFQxNzozNjo0NlrOGStnPg==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyMjI3NDg3OA==", "bodyText": "currently", "url": "https://github.com/all-of-us/workbench/pull/3529#discussion_r422274878", "createdAt": "2020-05-08T17:36:46Z", "author": {"login": "calbach"}, "path": "README.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -1,11 +1,23 @@\n # Workbench\n+CircleCI Test Status [![CircleCI Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/all-of-us/workbench.svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/all-of-us/workflows/workbench)\n \n-[![CircleCI Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/all-of-us/workbench.svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/all-of-us/workflows/workbench)\n+## Introduction\n+The [All of Us Research Program](https://allofus.nih.gov/) Researcher Workbench is a platform for researchers to work with program\n+data in a secure and convenient way.
