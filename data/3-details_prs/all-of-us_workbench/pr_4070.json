It should always be possible to update existing BigQuery  tables with new column descriptions.\nIntroduce a new input file that's just a yaml map from column name to description. At some point I want to simplify and consolidate input files, but for now, it's all right.\nOne more  output format to give an unpopulated definitions yaml file for input.\nIn the course of researching the cohort table columns, I realized I needed to drop a couple of columns that aren't user-facingi or for external consumption (at least not yet).\n\nPR checklist\n\n This PR meets the Acceptance Criteria in the JIRA story\n The JIRA story has been moved to Dev Review\n This PR includes appropriate unit tests\n I have run and tested this change locally\n I have run the E2E tests on ths change against my local UI + API server with yarn test-local\n If this includes a UI change, I have taken screen recordings or screenshots of the new behavior and notified the PO and UX designer\n If this includes an API change, I have updated the appropriate Swagger definitions and notified API consumers\n If this includes a new feature flag, I have created and linked new JIRA tickets to (a) turn on the feature flag and (b) remove it later", "createdAt": "2020-09-25T21:12:56Z", "url": "https://github.com/all-of-us/workbench/pull/4070", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid":
