While this approach would still work, in Jan 2019 this would typically done with Docker cluster and orchestration tools like Kubernetes. See for example [this blog post](https://lucidworks.com/2019/02/07/running-solr-on-kubernetes-part-1/)._\n+\n+In this example I'll create a cluster with 3 ZooKeeper nodes and 3 Solr nodes, distributed over 3 machines (trinity10, trinity20, trinity30).\n+I'll use an overlay network, specify fixed IP addresses when creating containers, and I'll pass in explicit `/etc/hosts` entries to make sure they are available even when nodes are down.\n+I won't show the configuration of the key-value store to configuration to enable networking, see [the docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/get-started-overlay/) for that.\n+I'll not use Docker Swarm in this example, but specifically place and configure containers where I want them by ssh'ing into the appropriate Docker host.\n+\n+To make this example easier to understand I'll just use shell commands.\n+For actual use you may want to use a fancier deployment tool like [Fabric](http://www.fabfile.org).\n+\n+Note: this example requires Docker 1.10.\n+\n+I'll run these commands from the first machine, trinity10.\n+\n+Create a network named \"netzksolr\" for this cluster. The `--ip-range` specifies the range of\n+addresses to use for containers, whereas the `--subnet` specifies all possible addresses in this\n+network. So effectively, addresses in the subnet but outside the range are reserved for containers\n+that specifically use the `--ip` option.\n+\n+```\n+docker network create --driver=overlay --subnet 192.168.22.0/24 --ip-range=192.168.22.128/25 netzksolr\n+```\n+\n+As a simple test, check the automatic assignment and specific assignment work:\n+\n+```\n+mak@trinity10:~$ docker run -i --rm --net=netzksolr busybox ip -4 addr show eth0 | grep inet", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "901162da8e71250ab75159262b5373caeea9c2af"}, "originalPosition": 30}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMjk5ODU2MzI2OnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "solr/docker/build.gradle", "isResolved": true, "comments": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wOC0yOVQxMTozMDo1MVrOHJa7Dg==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wOC0yOVQxOToxODo0NlrOHJdaWw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ3OTY0MDMzNA==", "bodyText": "Hi,\nas noted on Slack already.

The same is true for\n+changes to configuration files.\n+\n+Equally, if you `docker commit` your container, you can later create a new\n+container from that image, and that will have your data in it.\n+\n+For some use-cases it is convenient to provide a modified `solr.in.sh` file to Solr.\n+For example to point Solr to a ZooKeeper host:\n+\n+```\n+docker create --name my_solr -P solr\n+docker cp my_solr:/opt/solr/bin/solr.in.sh .\n+sed -i -e 's/#ZK_HOST=.*/ZK_HOST=cylon.lan:2181/' solr.in.sh\n+docker cp solr.in.sh my_solr:/opt/solr/bin/solr.in.sh\n+docker start my_solr\n+# With a browser go to http://cylon.lan:32873/solr/#/ and confirm \"-DzkHost=cylon.lan:2181\" in the JVM Args section.\n+```\n+\n+But usually when people ask this question, what they are after is a way\n+to store Solr data and config in a separate [Docker Volume](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockervolumes/).\n+That is explained in the next two questions.\n+\n+\n+How can I mount a host directory as a data volume?\n+--------------------------------------------------\n+\n+This is useful if you want to inspect or modify the data in the Docker host\n+when the container is not running, and later easily run new containers against that data.\n+This is indeed possible, but there are a few gotchas.\n+\n+Solr stores its core data in the `server/solr` directory, in sub-directories\n+for each core. The `server/solr` directory also contains configuration files\n+that are part of the Solr distribution.\n+Now, if we mounted volumes for each core individually, then that would\n+interfere with Solr trying to create those directories. If instead we make\n+the whole directory a volume, then we need to provide those configuration files\n+in our volume, which we can do by copying them from a temporary container.\n+For example:\n+\n+```\n+# create a directory to store the server/solr directory\n+$ mkdir /home/docker-volumes/mysolr1\n+\n+# make sure its host owner matches the container's solr user\n+$ sudo chown 8983:8983 /home/docker-volumes/mysolr1\n+\n+# copy the solr directory from a temporary container to the volume\n+$ docker run -it --rm -v /home/docker-volumes/mysolr1:/target apache/solr cp -r server/solr /target/\n+\n+# pass the solr directory to a new container running solr\n+$ SOLR_CONTAINER=$(docker run -d -P -v /home/docker-volumes/mysolr1/solr:/opt/solr/server/solr apache/solr)\n+\n+# create a new core\n+$ docker exec -it --user=solr $SOLR_CONTAINER solr create_core -c gettingstarted\n+\n+# check the volume on the host:\n+$ ls /home/docker-volumes/mysolr1/solr/\n+configsets  gettingstarted  README.txt  solr.xml  zoo.cfg\n+```\n+\n+Note that if you add or modify files in that directory from the host, you must `chown 8983:8983` them.\n+\n+\n+How can I use a Data Volume Container?\n+--------------------------------------\n+\n+You can avoid the concerns about UID mismatches above, by using data volumes only from containers.\n+You can create a container with a volume, then point future containers at that same volume.\n+This can be handy if you want to modify the solr image, for example if you want to add a program.\n+By separating the data and the code, you can change the code and re-use the data.\n+\n+But there are pitfalls:\n+\n+- if you remove the container that owns the volume, then you lose your data.\n+  Docker does not even warn you that a running container is dependent on it.\n+- if you point multiple solr containers at the same volume, you will have multiple instances\n+  write to the same files, which will undoubtedly lead to corruption\n+- if you do want to remove that volume, you must do `docker rm -v containername`;\n+  if you forget the `-v` there will be a dangling volume which you can not easily clean up.\n+\n+Here is an example:\n+\n+```\n+# create a container with a volume on the path that solr uses to store data.\n+docker create -v /opt/solr/server/solr --name mysolr1data solr /bin/true\n+\n+# pass the volume to a new container running solr\n+SOLR_CONTAINER=$(docker run -d -P --volumes-from=mysolr1data apache/solr)\n+\n+# create a new core\n+$ docker exec -it --user=solr $SOLR_CONTAINER solr create_core -c gettingstarted\n+\n+# make a change to the config, using the config API\n+docker exec -it --user=solr $SOLR_CONTAINER curl http://localhost:8983/solr/gettingstarted/config -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d'{\n+    \"set-property\" : {\"query.filterCache.autowarmCount\":1000},\n+    \"unset-property\" :\"query.filterCache.size\"}'\n+\n+# verify the change took effect\n+docker exec -it --user=solr $SOLR_CONTAINER curl http://localhost:8983/solr/gettingstarted/config/overlay?omitHeader=true\n+\n+# stop the solr container\n+docker exec -it --user=solr $SOLR_CONTAINER bash -c 'cd server;

future versions are better at recovering.\n+\n+Docker 1.10 has a new `--ip` configuration option that allows you to specify an IP address for a container.\n+It also has a `--ip-range` option that allows you to specify the range that other containers get addresses from.\n+Used together, you can implement static addresses. See [this example](docs/docker-networking.md).\n+\n+\n+Can I run ZooKeeper and Solr with Docker Links?\n+-----------------------------------------------\n+\n+Docker's [Legacy container links](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/default_network/dockerlinks/) provide a way to\n+pass connection configuration between containers. It only works on a single machine, on the default bridge.\n+It provides no facilities for static IPs.\n+Note: this feature is expected to be deprecated and removed in a future release.\n+So really, see the \"Can I run ZooKeeper and Solr clusters under Docker?\" option above instead.\n+\n+But for some use-cases, such as quick demos or one-shot automated testing, it can be convenient.\n+\n+Run ZooKeeper, and define a name so we can link to it:\n+\n+```console\n+$ docker run --name zookeeper -d -p 2181:2181 -p 2888:2888 -p 3888:3888 jplock/zookeeper\n+```\n+\n+Run two Solr nodes, linked to the zookeeper container:\n+\n+```console\n+$ docker run --name solr1 --link zookeeper:ZK -d -p 8983:8983 \\\n+      apache/solr \\\n+      bash -c 'solr start -f -z $ZK_PORT_2181_TCP_ADDR:$ZK_PORT_2181_TCP_PORT'\n+\n+$ docker run --name solr2 --link zookeeper:ZK -d -p 8984:8983 \\\n+      apache/solr \\\n+      bash -c 'solr start -f -z $ZK_PORT_2181_TCP_ADDR:$ZK_PORT_2181_TCP_PORT'\n+```\n+\n+Create a collection:\n+\n+```console\n+$ docker exec -i -t solr1 solr create_collection \\\n+        -c gettingstarted -shards 2 -p 8983\n+```\n+\n+Then go to `http://localhost:8983/solr/#/~cloud` (adjust the hostname for your docker host) to see the two shards and Solr nodes.\n+\n+\n+How can I run ZooKeeper and Solr with Docker Compose?\n+-----------------------------------------------------\n+\n+See the [docker compose example](docs/docker-compose.yml).\n+\n+\n+I'm confused about the different invocations of solr -- help?\n+-------------------------------------------------------------\n+\n+The different invocations of the Solr docker image can look confusing, because the name of the\n+image is \"solr\" and the Solr command is also \"solr\", and the image interprets various arguments in", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "386552bf0141438e0edc3b3d0c6802dbdc6eb5f3"}, "originalPosition": 227}]}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 1311, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-12T11:18:39Z"}}}
