It makes it much easier to review if your code is\n+formatted correctly and does not include unnecessary extra changes.\n+\n+We sometimes reject contributions if we find ourselves performing many review\n+iterations without making enough progress. Some iteration is expected,\n+particularly on technically complicated changes, and there's no fixed limit on\n+the acceptable number of review cycles since it depends so much on the nature\n+of the change.
