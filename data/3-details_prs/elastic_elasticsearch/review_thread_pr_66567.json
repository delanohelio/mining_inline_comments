These two settings must be equal to each other.\n-\n-The value for these settings depends on the amount of RAM available on your\n-server:\n-\n-* Set `Xmx` and `Xms` to no more than 50% of your physical RAM. {es} requires\n-  memory for purposes other than the JVM heap and it is important to leave\n-  space for this. For instance, {es} uses off-heap buffers for efficient\n-  network communication, relies on the operating system's filesystem cache for\n-  efficient access to files, and the JVM itself requires some memory too. It is\n-  normal to observe the {es} process using more memory than the limit\n-  configured with the `Xmx` setting.\n-\n-* Set `Xmx` and `Xms` to no more than the threshold that the JVM uses for\n-  compressed object pointers (compressed oops). The exact threshold varies but\n-  is near 32 GB. You can verify that you are under the threshold by looking for a line in the logs like the following:\n-+\n-[source,txt]\n-----\n-heap size [1.9gb], compressed ordinary object pointers [true]\n-----\n-\n-* Set `Xmx` and `Xms` to no more than the threshold for zero-based\n-  compressed oops. The exact threshold varies but 26 GB is safe on most\n-  systems and can be as large as 30 GB on some systems. You can verify that\n-  you are under this threshold by starting {es} with the JVM options\n-  `-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:+PrintCompressedOopsMode` and looking for\n-  a line like the following:\n-+\n-[source,txt]\n-----\n-heap address: 0x000000011be00000, size: 27648 MB, zero based Compressed Oops\n-----\n-+\n-This line shows that zero-based compressed oops are enabled. If zero-based\n-compressed oops are not enabled, you'll see a line like the following instead:\n-+\n-[source,txt]\n-----\n-heap address: 0x0000000118400000, size: 28672 MB, Compressed Oops with base: 0x00000001183ff000\n-----\n-\n-The more heap available to {es}, the more memory it can use for its internal\n-caches, but the less memory it leaves available for the operating system to use\n-for the filesystem cache. Also, larger heaps can cause longer garbage\n-collection pauses.\n-\n-Here is an example of how to set the heap size via a `jvm.options.d/` file:\n-\n-[source,txt]\n-------------------\n--Xms2g <1>\n--Xmx2g <2>\n-------------------\n-<1> Set the minimum heap size to 2g.\n-<2> Set the maximum heap size to 2g.\n-\n-Using `jvm.options.d` is the preferred method for configuring the heap size for\n-production deployments.\n-\n-It is also possible to set the heap size via the `ES_JAVA_OPTS` environment\n-variable. This is generally discouraged for production deployments but is useful\n-for testing because it overrides all other means of setting JVM options.\n-\n-[source,sh]\n-------------------\n-ES_JAVA_OPTS=\"-Xms2g -Xmx2g\" ./bin/elasticsearch <1>\n-ES_JAVA_OPTS=\"-Xms4000m -Xmx4000m\" ./bin/elasticsearch <2>\n-------------------\n-<1> Set the minimum and maximum heap size to 2 GB.\n-<2> Set the minimum and maximum heap size to 4000 MB.\n-\n-NOTE: Configuring the heap for the <<windows-service,Windows service>> is\n-different than the above. The values initially populated for the Windows\n-service can be configured as above but are different after the service has been\n-installed.
