The exact threshold varies but\n-  is near 32 GB. You can verify that you are under the threshold by looking for a line in the logs like the following:\n-+\n-[source,txt]\n-----\n-heap size [1.9gb], compressed ordinary object pointers [true]\n-----\n-\n-* Set `Xmx` and `Xms` to no more than the threshold for zero-based\n-  compressed oops.

You can verify that\n-  you are under this threshold by starting {es} with the JVM options\n-  `-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:+PrintCompressedOopsMode` and looking for\n-  a line like the following:\n-+\n-[source,txt]\n-----\n-heap address: 0x000000011be00000, size: 27648 MB, zero based Compressed Oops\n-----\n-+\n-This line shows that zero-based compressed oops are enabled. If zero-based\n-compressed oops are not enabled, you'll see a line like the following instead:\n-+\n-[source,txt]\n-----\n-heap address: 0x0000000118400000, size: 28672 MB, Compressed Oops with base: 0x00000001183ff000\n-----\n-\n-The more heap available to {es}, the more memory it can use for its internal\n-caches, but the less memory it leaves available for the operating system to use\n-for the filesystem cache. Also, larger heaps can cause longer garbage\n-collection pauses.\n-\n-Here is an example of how to set the heap size via a `jvm.options.d/` file:\n-\n-[source,txt]\n-------------------\n--Xms2g <1>\n--Xmx2g <2>\n-------------------\n-<1> Set the minimum heap size to 2g.\n-<2> Set the maximum heap size to 2g.\n-\n-Using `jvm.options.d` is the preferred method for configuring the heap size for\n-production deployments.\n-\n-It is also possible to set the heap size via the `ES_JAVA_OPTS` environment\n-variable. This is generally discouraged for production deployments but is useful\n-for testing because it overrides all other means of setting JVM options.\n-\n-[source,sh]\n-------------------\n-ES_JAVA_OPTS=\"-Xms2g -Xmx2g\" ./bin/elasticsearch <1>\n-ES_JAVA_OPTS=\"-Xms4000m -Xmx4000m\" ./bin/elasticsearch <2>\n-------------------\n-<1> Set the minimum and maximum heap size to 2 GB.\n-<2> Set the minimum and maximum heap size to 4000 MB.\n-\n-NOTE: Configuring the heap for the <<windows-service,Windows service>> is\n-different than the above.

This is generally discouraged for production deployments but is useful\n+for testing because it overrides all other means of setting JVM options.\n+\n+[source,sh]\n+------------------\n+ES_JAVA_OPTS=\"-Xms2g -Xmx2g\" ./bin/elasticsearch <1>\n+ES_JAVA_OPTS=\"-Xms4000m -Xmx4000m\" ./bin/elasticsearch <2>\n+------------------\n+<1> Set the minimum and maximum heap size to 2 GB.\n+<2> Set the minimum and maximum heap size to 4000 MB.\n+\n+NOTE: Configuring the heap for the <<windows-service,Windows service>> is\n+different than the above. The values initially populated for the Windows\n+service can be configured as above but are different after the service has been\n+installed. Consult the <<windows-service,Windows service documentation>> for\n+additional details.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "dae25a763c4f7da9398c09e1062be969df4cf44b"}, "originalPosition": 89}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "2aed1b03730972e7c12132d9b615d7c6362a8b51", "author": {"user": {"login": "mark-vieira", "name": "Mark Vieira"}}, "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/2aed1b03730972e7c12132d9b615d7c6362a8b51", "committedDate": "2020-12-18T18:53:35Z", "message": "Update docs/reference/setup/important-settings/heap-size.asciidoc\n\nCo-authored-by: James Rodewig <40268737+jrodewig@users.noreply.github.com>"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "58868ddc0dbea5b2043883badd5ce23e4c20b80f", "author": {"user": {"login": "mark-vieira", "name": "Mark Vieira"}}, "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/58868ddc0dbea5b2043883badd5ce23e4c20b80f", "committedDate": "2020-12-18T18:53:50Z", "message": "Update docs/reference/setup/important-settings/heap-size.asciidoc\n\nCo-authored-by: James Rodewig <40268737+jrodewig@users.noreply.github.com>"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "258fb757404c326b608d8ca592eca82aa050827d", "author": {"user": {"login": "mark-vieira", "name": "Mark Vieira"}}, "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/258fb757404c326b608d8ca592eca82aa050827d", "committedDate": "2020-12-18T18:54:11Z", "message": "Update docs/reference/setup/advanced-configuration.asciidoc\n\nCo-authored-by: James Rodewig <40268737+jrodewig@users.noreply.github.com>"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "81ffe987e9fa554abe0ea843ed6b9014d083892c", "author": {"user": {"login": "mark-vieira", "name": "Mark Vieira"}}, "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/81ffe987e9fa554abe0ea843ed6b9014d083892c", "committedDate": "2020-12-18T18:54:20Z", "message": "Update docs/reference/setup/advanced-configuration.asciidoc\n\nCo-authored-by: James Rodewig <40268737+jrodewig@users.noreply.github.com>"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "0d2e65f487eb33b0a8ecddd86db86f15032cc5bb", "author": {"user": {"login": "mark-vieira", "name": "Mark Vieira"}}, "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/0d2e65f487eb33b0a8ecddd86db86f15032cc5bb", "committedDate": "2020-12-18T18:54:32Z", "message": "Update docs/reference/setup/advanced-configuration.asciidoc\n\nCo-authored-by: James Rodewig <40268737+jrodewig@users.noreply.github.com>"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "9407ccb3dc44bcce86e4d58a04b62e12682ed238", "author": {"user": {"login": "mark-vieira", "name": "Mark Vieira"}}, "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/9407ccb3dc44bcce86e4d58a04b62e12682ed238", "committedDate": "2020-12-18T18:54:41Z", "message": "Update docs/reference/setup/advanced-configuration.asciidoc\n\nCo-authored-by: James Rodewig <40268737+jrodewig@users.noreply.github.com>"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "c57a415d51f540aab86c497aeade628afc4df6f4", "author": {"user": {"login": "mark-vieira", "name": "Mark Vieira"}}, "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/c57a415d51f540aab86c497aeade628afc4df6f4", "committedDate": "2020-12-18T18:54:53Z", "message": "Update docs/reference/setup/advanced-configuration.asciidoc\n\nCo-authored-by: James Rodewig <40268737+jrodewig@users.noreply.github.com>"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "fa5772162282a1f62d040449c287298a7eda2f87", "author": {"user": {"login": "mark-vieira", "name": "Mark Vieira"}}, "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/fa5772162282a1f62d040449c287298a7eda2f87", "committedDate": "2020-12-18T18:55:03Z", "message": "Update docs/reference/setup/advanced-configuration.asciidoc\n\nCo-authored-by: James Rodewig <40268737+jrodewig@users.noreply.github.com>"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "d0c658ae95b0d2313d31f2ef04c7a266c7341a5a", "author": {"user": {"login": "mark-vieira", "name": "Mark Vieira"}}, "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/d0c658ae95b0d2313d31f2ef04c7a266c7341a5a", "committedDate": "2020-12-18T18:55:09Z", "message": "Update docs/reference/setup/advanced-configuration.asciidoc\n\nCo-authored-by: James Rodewig <40268737+jrodewig@users.noreply.github.com>"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "573bb2c42c127e58ec944903e6e8b76f1c9a0c9e", "author": {"user": {"login": "mark-vieira", "name": "Mark Vieira"}}, "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/573bb2c42c127e58ec944903e6e8b76f1c9a0c9e", "committedDate": "2020-12-18T19:02:01Z", "message": "More minor tweaks"}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 4353, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-10-28T18:54:27Z"}}}
