Each aggregation\n-is associated with a logical name that the user defines (e.g. if the aggregation computes the average price, then it would\n-make sense to name it `avg_price`). These logical names will also be used to uniquely identify the aggregations in the\n-response. Each aggregation has a specific type (`<aggregation_type>` in the above snippet) and is typically the first\n-key within the named aggregation body. Each type of aggregation defines its own body, depending on the nature of the\n-aggregation (e.g. an `avg` aggregation on a specific field will define the field on which the average will be calculated).\n-At the same level of the aggregation type definition, one can optionally define a set of additional aggregations,\n-though this only makes sense if the aggregation you defined is of a bucketing nature. In this scenario, the\n-sub-aggregations you define on the bucketing aggregation level will be computed for all the buckets built by the\n-bucketing aggregation. For example, if you define a set of aggregations under the `range` aggregation, the\n-sub-aggregations will be computed for the range buckets that are defined.\n+----\n+// TEST[setup:my_index]\n+// TEST[s/my-field/http.request.method/]\n+// TEST[s/my-other-field/http.response.bytes/]\n \n [discrete]\n-=== Values Source\n-\n-Some aggregations work on values extracted from the aggregated documents. Typically, the values will be extracted from\n-a specific document field which is set using the `field` key for the aggregations. It is also possible to define a\n-<<modules-scripting,`script`>> which will generate the values (per document).\n-\n-When both `field` and `script` settings are configured for the aggregation, the script will be treated as a\n-`value script`.  While normal scripts are evaluated on a document level (i.e. the script has access to all the data\n-associated with the document), value scripts are evaluated on the *value* level. In this mode, the values are extracted\n-from the configured `field` and the `script` is used to apply a \"transformation\" over these value/s.\n-\n-[\"NOTE\",id=\"aggs-script-note\"]\n-===============================\n-When working with scripts, the `lang` and `params` settings can also be defined. The former defines the scripting\n-language which is used (assuming the proper language is available in Elasticsearch, either by default or as a plugin). The latter\n-enables defining all the \"dynamic\" expressions in the script as parameters, which enables the script to keep itself static\n-between calls (this will ensure the use of the cached compiled scripts in Elasticsearch).\n-===============================\n-\n-Elasticsearch uses the type of the field in the mapping in order to figure out\n-how to run the aggregation and format the response. However there are two cases\n-in which Elasticsearch cannot figure out this information: unmapped fields (for\n-instance in the case of a search request across multiple indices, and only some\n-of them have a mapping for the field) and pure scripts. For those cases, it is\n-possible to give Elasticsearch a hint using the `value_type` option, which\n-accepts the following values: `string`, `long` (works for all integer types),\n-`double` (works for all decimal types like `float` or `scaled_float`), `date`,\n-`ip` and `boolean`.\n+[[add-metadata-to-an-agg]]\n+=== Add custom metadata\n \n---\n+Use the `meta` object to associate custom metadata with an aggregation:\n \n-include::aggregations/metrics.asciidoc[]\n+[source,console]\n+----\n+GET /my-index-000001/_search\n+{\n+  \"aggs\": {\n+    \"my-agg-name\": {\n+      \"terms\": {\n+        \"field\": \"my-field\"\n+      },\n+      \"meta\": {\n+        \"my-metadata-field\": \"foo\"\n+      }\n+    }\n+  }\n+}\n+----\n+// TEST[setup:my_index]\n+// TEST[s/_search/_search?size=0/]\n \n-include::aggregations/bucket.asciidoc[]\n+The response returns the `meta` object in place:\n \n-include::aggregations/pipeline.asciidoc[]\n+[source,console-result]\n+----\n+{\n+  ...\n+  \"aggregations\": {\n+    \"my-agg-name\": {\n+      \"meta\": {\n+        \"my-metadata-field\": \"foo\"\n+      },\n+      \"doc_count_error_upper_bound\": 0,\n+      \"sum_other_doc_count\": 0,\n+      \"buckets\": []\n+    }\n+  }\n+}\n+----\n+// TESTRESPONSE[s/\\.\\.\\./\"took\": \"$body.took\", \"timed_out\": false, \"_shards\": \"$body._shards\", \"hits\": \"$body.hits\",/]\n+\n+[discrete]\n+[[return-agg-type]]\n+=== Return the aggregation type\n+\n+By default, aggregation results include the aggregation's name but not its type.\n+To return the aggregation type, use the `typed_keys` query parameter.\n+\n+[source,console]\n+----\n+GET /my-index-000001/_search?typed_keys\n+{\n+  \"aggs\": {\n+    \"my-agg-name\": {\n+      \"histogram\": {\n+        \"field\": \"my-field\",\n+        \"interval\": 1000\n+      }\n+    }\n+  }\n+}\n+----\n+// TEST[setup:my_index]\n+// TEST[s/typed_keys/typed_keys&size=0/]\n+// TEST[s/my-field/http.response.bytes/]\n+\n+The response returns the aggregation type as a prefix to the aggregation's name.\n+\n+IMPORTANT: Some aggregations return a different aggregation type from the\n+type in the request.
