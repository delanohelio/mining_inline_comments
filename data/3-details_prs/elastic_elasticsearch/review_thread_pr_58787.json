It consults both the document `_source` and the index\n+mappings to return each value in a standardized way that matches its mapping\n+type. By default, date fields are formatted according to the\n+<<mapping-date-format,date format>> parameter in their mappings.\n+\n+.*Example*\n+[%collapsible]\n+====\n+The following search request uses the `fields` parameter to retrieve values\n+for the `clientip` field, all fields starting with `location.`, and the\n+`timestamp` field:\n+\n+[source,console]\n+----\n+POST logs-*/_search\n+{\n+  \"query\": {\n+    \"match_all\": {}\n+  },\n+  \"fields\": [\n+    \"clientip\",\n+    \"location.*\", <1>\n+    {\n+      \"field\": \"timestamp\",\n+      \"format\": \"epoch_millis\" <2>\n+    }\n+  ],\n+  \"_source\": false\n+}\n+----\n+\n+<1> Both full field names and wildcard patterns are accepted.\n+<2> Using object notation, you can pass a `format` parameter to apply a custom\n+    format for the field's values. This is currently supported for\n+    <<date,`date` fields>> and <<date_nanos, `date_nanos` fields>>, which\n+    accept a <<mapping-date-format,date format>>.\n+\n+The values are returned as a flat list in the `fields` section in each hit:\n+\n+[source,console-result]\n+----\n+{\n+  \"took\" : 2,\n+  \"timed_out\" : false,\n+  \"_shards\" : {\n+    \"total\" : 1,\n+    \"successful\" : 1,\n+    \"skipped\" : 0,\n+    \"failed\" : 0\n+  },\n+  \"hits\" : {\n+    \"total\" : {\n+      \"value\" : 1,\n+      \"relation\" : \"eq\"\n+    },\n+    \"max_score\" : 1.0,\n+    \"hits\" : [\n+      {\n+        \"_index\" : \"http-logs\",\n+        \"_id\" : \"1\",\n+        \"_score\" : 1.0,\n+        \"fields\" : {\n+          \"clientip\" : [\n+            \"192.0.2.0\"\n+          ],\n+          \"location.city\" : [\n+            \"Toronto\"\n+          ],\n+          \"location.country\" : [\n+            \"Canada\"\n+          ],\n+          \"timestamp\" : [\n+            \"1593274413000\"\n+          ]\n+        }\n+      }\n+    ]\n+  }\n+}\n+----\n+// TESTRESPONSE[skip:no test set-up]", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0ODAxODQwNQ=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "93178158870ecf3660cca8c65c99b93c08fc6e14"}, "originalPosition": 147}]}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 2173, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-12T13:16:51Z"}}}
