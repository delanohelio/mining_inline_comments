The minimum high-enough value might be hard to get right, but a fast run of the TDVT tests yield a ~7 tests/sec, so with a generous margin, just for testing, one could set a value of `1000/1m`.\n+\n+The data for running the TDVT suite needs to be loaded into Elasticsearch prior to running the tests. This can be achieved in a few ways:\n+\n+### 1. Import using Elastic's ODBC driver testing suite\n+\n+ODBC's driver test suite is a Python application that, among other things, will load the testing data into a running Elasticsearch instance.\n+It requires a Python 3 installation with [requests](python-requests.org) and [psutils](https://pypi.org/project/psutil/) PIP modules installed.\n+\n+Clone it from its [Github repo](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-sql-odbc/) and run the following from within the top repo directory:\n+```\n+python3 ./test/integration/ites.py -p http://user:password@host:port -tx\n+```\n+where the `user`, `password`, `host` and `port` are the credentials and URL to access the Elasticsearch instance.\n+\n+This will download the TDVT CSV data sources from their [connector-plugin-sdk](https://github.com/tableau/connector-plugin-sdk/tree/master/tests/datasets/TestV1) repository and upload them to the destination test Elasticsearch instance. (It will also install the needed pipelines, templates/mappings to accomodate the source data, along with other test data irrelevant for TDVT testing -- just ignore or delete the other created indices).\n+\n+### 2. Reindex from remote\n+\n+Note: this requires some familiarity with Elasticsearch.\n+\n+If there is an available other Elasticsearch instance running, that has the test data loaded already, this data can be imported through the `_reindex` [API](www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-reindex.html). Follow the two steps detailed in [Reindex from a remote cluster](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/reindex-upgrade-remote.html).\n+\n+<TODO: detailed sequence of steps>\n+\n+### 3. Import using Elastic's Logstash application\n+\n+[Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/running-logstash-windows.html) is a Java application that can ingest data from various sources and in various formats and upload them into an Elasticsearch instance.\n+\n+Note that Logstash will add a few extra fields per row (\"document\" in Elasticsearch lingo); these shouldn't interfere with the testing, however.\n+\n+1. Download TDVT's data files [Calcs.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tableau/connector-plugin-sdk/tdvt-2.1.9/tests/datasets/TestV1/Calcs.csv) and [Staples_utf8.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tableau/connector-plugin-sdk/tdvt-2.1.9/tests/datasets/TestV1/Staples_utf8.csv) and place them into a directory that will be reachable by Logstash.\n+\n+2. Create the Elasticsearch indices `calcs` and `staples` and use for them the [mappings](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-put-mapping.html) under these links: [calcs](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-sql-odbc/blob/577cd2fa1ed257e42081a082682c8c089b179565/test/integration/data.py#L27) and [stapes](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-sql-odbc/blob/577cd2fa1ed257e42081a082682c8c089b179565/test/integration/data.py#L87). Create an ingest [pipeline](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/put-pipeline-api.html) called `calcs-pipeline` with the definition [here](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-sql-odbc/blob/577cd2fa1ed257e42081a082682c8c089b179565/test/integration/data.py#L62).\n+\n+3. Adapt the [config file](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/configuration-file-structure.html#configuration-file-structure) under the `logstash` folder, updating the <path>, <host> and <password> tags in it.\n+\n+4. Relaunch Logstash using the updated config file in previous step and wait until the files have been ingested. `calcs` index will need to have 17 documents and `staples` 54860.\n+\n+\n+## Running TDVT\n+\n+### Automated\n+\n+1. Place Elasticsearch JDBC driver into [Tableau's driver folder](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/examples_otherdatabases_jdbc.htm) under: `C:\\Program Files\\Tableau\\Drivers`.\n+\n+2. Place the `.taco` file either in Tableau's dedicated connectors directory, `C:\\Users\\[Windows User]\\Documents\\My Tableau Repository\\Connectors`, or a custom one (\"<taco dir path>\").\n+\n+3. Use the `tdvt_run.py` application, that clone the TDVT SDK repo, setup config files and launch the TDVT run:\n+    ```\n+    python3 ./tdvt_run.py -u \"http://user:pass@elastic-host:9200\" -t <taco dir path>\n+    ```\n+\n+### Manually\n+\n+Setting up the TDVT testing involves following the steps detailed in the [official documentation](https://tableau.github.io/connector-plugin-sdk/docs/tdvt). The \"fragment\" in parantheses reference the respective chapters in the documentation. It is recommended to execute each test run starting afresh.\n+\n+1. Same as in the automated testing.\n+\n+2. Create new Tableau data sources for the `calcs` and `Staple` tables (#`Test a new data source`), or, alternatively, use those available already in this repo.\n+\tTo set up new sources, launch Tableau from command line with the following parameters (PowerShell example):\n+\t```\n+\t.\\tableau.exe -DConnectPluginsPath=<path> -DDisableVerifyConnectorPluginSignature=true\n+\t```\n+\twhere `<path>` is either the path to the directory containing the `.taco` connector *or* the path to the directory containing the connector directory, if this isn't yet packaged.\n+  \n+\t**Note**: When connecting, make sure you pass the `timezone=Z` parameter into the `Additional settings` field of the connection dialog. This sets the timezone for the time data to UTC; if this isn't set, the JDBC driver will use JVM's/system's time zone, which will then result in some failed tests if the machine's not set to the UTC timezone.\n+\n+\tSave the TDS files as `cast_calcs.elastic.tds` and `Staples.elastic.tds`\n+\n+3. Setup a TDVT \"workspace\" (#`Set up`), i.e. a directory containing the test files.\n+\tEither package TDVT and install it as a Python PIP module (recommended, if [working](https://github.com/tableau/connector-plugin-sdk/issues/534)), or simply copy the `tdvt` directory of the repo into the \"workspace\" directory. Invoking the TDVT will then be done as `py -3 -m tdvt.tdvt <params>`, or `py -3 .\\tdvt\\tdvt_launcher.py <params>`, respectively. In the steps below the invokation will be indicated by the `$TDVT` call.\n+\t```\n+\t$TDVT action --setup\n+\t```\n+\n+\tCopy/move the above saved `*.tds` files into the just created `tds` directory in the workspace.\n+\tEdit `config/tdvt/tdvt_override.ini` to update `TAB_CLI_EXE_X64` definition.\n+\n+4. Generate the tests by invoking TDVT as follows:\n+\n+\t```\n+\t$TDVT action --add_ds elastic\n+\t```\n+\n+\tWhen asked for a password, use the same value as in step \"2.\" above when connecting to Elasticsearch.\n+\tFor the \"logical query config\" use `simple_lower`.\n+\n+\tEdit the `elastic.ini` file in the `config` directory in the workspace and add the following line under the `[Datasource]` section: `CommandLineOverride = -DConnectPluginsPath=<path> -DDisableVerifyConnectorPluginSignature=true`, where `<path>` has the same value as in step \"1.\".", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "ad44abdf6626157192acc24da227ef3020f91eeb"}, "originalPosition": 108}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "09eeb0a9420f0aff108cb0af34463ef3f396757c", "author": {"user": {"login": "bpintea", "name": "Bogdan Pintea"}}, "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/09eeb0a9420f0aff108cb0af34463ef3f396757c", "committedDate": "2020-10-21T09:13:31Z", "message": "Address review comments\r\n\r\nUpdate numbering references within text."}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NTEzNTQ1NDM2", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/63751#pullrequestreview-513545436", "createdAt": "2020-10-21T10:48:55Z", "commit": {"oid": "09eeb0a9420f0aff108cb0af34463ef3f396757c"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMC0yMVQxMDo0ODo1NVrOHllzQA==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMC0yMVQxMDo0ODo1NVrOHllzQA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwOTE3ODY4OA==", "bodyText": "Should we mention something about appropriate versions based on the es node/cluster version?", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/63751#discussion_r509178688", "createdAt": "2020-10-21T10:48:55Z", "author": {"login": "matriv"}, "path": "x-pack/plugin/sql/connectors/tableau/README.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,19 @@\n+# Tableau connector for Elasticsearch\n+\n+The Tableau Connector works in tandem with the Elastic JDBC driver to facilitate the query of Elasticsearch.
