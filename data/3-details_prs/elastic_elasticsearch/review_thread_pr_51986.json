It should be replaced to y in 7.0 This is a big change because in 7.0 'Y' means week-based-year.\n+If you don't update your date pattern, you will have problems with search results, parsing and date calculations.\n+example:\n+`YYYY-MM-dd` should become `yyyy-MM-dd`\n+\n+====== The difference between year-of-era and week based year\n+For pattern `YYYY-ww` and date `2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z`  will give `2019-01`\n+For pattern `YYYY-ww` and date `2018-12-31T00:00:00.000Z`  will give `2019-01` (counter intuitive) because there is >4 days of that week in 2019\n+\n+===== y - in 6.8 meaning year. It should be replaced to 'u' in 7.0. This is a subtle change, but worth fixing.\n+As previously stated `y` means year-of-era. `u` means year. The difference is that year can contain non positive values, whereas `y` can not. //clarify 0 year\n+year-of-era can also be associated with an era field.\n+\n+===== C - century of era is no longer supported in 7.0. There is no replacement, so you need to preprocess your input.\n+https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38354151/how-to-force-java-time-localdate-to-assume-19th-century-as-yy-year-pattern\n+\n+===== x - in 6.8 meaning week year. It should be replaced with 'Y' in 7.0. Again a big change as 'x' means zone-offset in 7.0.\n+You will get parsing and search problems if you do not update this.\n+\n+===== Z - in 6.8 meaning time zone offset/id. It has similar meaning in 7.0 with a notable difference that it expects different number of literals\n+to parse different forms.\n+It also won't parse `Z` for Zulu timezone. You should consider migrating to `X` which give you more control of how your time is parsed.\n+For instance format `YYYY-MM-dd'T'hh:mm:ssZZ` allowed all the forms below:\n+\n+```\n+2010-01-01T01:02:03Z\n+2010-01-01T01:02:03+01\n+2010-01-01T01:02:03+01:02\n+2010-01-01T01:02:03+01:02:03\n+```\n+\n+\n+You cannot parse them all with one pattern in 7.0.

If you want to parse dates like `2010-01-00001` you need to create a pattern that expects a text literal `'000'` before `'d'`\n+`yyyy-MM-'000'dd`\n+\n+===== e for name of day\n+Also has a similar meaning in 7.0. However was more flexible in 6.8 and allowed to parse short and full text forms.\n+if you used `EEE YYYY-MM` for a format and expected days in form:\n+Wed 2020-01 or Wednesday 2020-01\n+then you have to use two combined patterns in 7.0\n+`cccc yyyy-MM||ccc yyyy-MM`\n+\n+E vs c. E means day-of-week vs c is for localized day-of-week. The difference is that E won't behave correctly for full text forms like Wednesday\n+\n+===== more on text forms EEEE and similar\n+Full text forms are depending on locale data provided with JDK and the implementation details of java vs joda. You should test carefully before upgrading these patterns.\n+\n+===== 'z'\n+'z' time zone text. Will print 'Z' for Zulu given UTC timezone.\n+\n+\n+===== Test with your data\n+All of the examples above should be tested with real data.

More on that below.\n+A custom format is specified on a date field like this:\n+[source,console]\n+--------------------------------------------------\n+PUT my_index\n+{\n+  \"mappings\": {\n+    \"properties\": {\n+      \"date\": {\n+        \"type\":   \"date\",\n+        \"format\": \"YYYY/MM/dd HH:mm:ss||YYYY/MM/dd||epoch_millis\"\n+      }\n+    }\n+  }\n+}\n+--------------------------------------------------\n+\n+To make sure if any of the date formats is deprecated run deprecation API or kibana upgrade assistant.\n+//todo fix this\n+xx migration-api-deprecation xx\n+xxinclude ::../apis/deprecation.asciidoc\n+\n+Sample output of deprecation api will be as follows:\n+[source,text]\n+--------------------------------------------------\n+This index has date fields with deprecated formats: [[type: doc, field: param2, format: yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss||yyyy/MM/dd||epoch_millis, suggestion: 'y' year should be replaced with 'u'. Use 'y' for year-of-era.]]. Prefix your date format with '8' to use the new specifier.\n+--------------------------------------------------\n+\n+\n+==== Incompatible formats\n+If a pattern contains literals below, that means the pattern is incompatible and needs to be changed.\n+\n+===== Y - in 6.8 meaning Year of era. It should be replaced to y in 7.0 This is a big change because in 7.0 'Y' means week-based-year.\n+If you don't update your date pattern, you will have problems with search results, parsing and date calculations.\n+example:\n+`YYYY-MM-dd` should become `yyyy-MM-dd`\n+\n+====== The difference between year-of-era and week based year\n+For pattern `YYYY-ww` and date `2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z`  will give `2019-01`\n+For pattern `YYYY-ww` and date `2018-12-31T00:00:00.000Z`  will give `2019-01` (counter intuitive) because there is >4 days of that week in 2019\n+\n+===== y - in 6.8 meaning year. It should be replaced to 'u' in 7.0. This is a subtle change, but worth fixing.\n+As previously stated `y` means year-of-era. `u` means year. The difference is that year can contain non positive values, whereas `y` can not. //clarify 0 year\n+year-of-era can also be associated with an era field.\n+\n+===== C - century of era is no longer supported in 7.0. There is no replacement, so you need to preprocess your input.\n+https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38354151/how-to-force-java-time-localdate-to-assume-19th-century-as-yy-year-pattern\n+\n+===== x - in 6.8 meaning week year. It should be replaced with 'Y' in 7.0. Again a big change as 'x' means zone-offset in 7.0.\n+You will get parsing and search problems if you do not update this.\n+\n+===== Z - in 6.8 meaning time zone offset/id. It has similar meaning in 7.0 with a notable difference that it expects different number of literals\n+to parse different forms.\n+It also won't parse `Z` for Zulu timezone. You should consider migrating to `X` which give you more control of how your time is parsed.\n+For instance format `YYYY-MM-dd'T'hh:mm:ssZZ` allowed all the forms below:\n+\n+```\n+2010-01-01T01:02:03Z\n+2010-01-01T01:02:03+01\n+2010-01-01T01:02:03+01:02\n+2010-01-01T01:02:03+01:02:03\n+```\n+\n+\n+You cannot parse them all with one pattern in 7.0. You need to specify 3 separate patterns\n+```\n+2010-01-01T01:02:03Z\n+2010-01-01T01:02:03+01\n+both parsed with yyyy-MM-dd'T'hh:mm:ssX\n+\n+2010-01-01T01:02:03+01:02\n+yyyy-MM-dd'T'hh:mm:ssXXX\n+\n+2010-01-01T01:02:03+01:02:03\n+yyyy-MM-dd'T'hh:mm:ssXXXXX\n+```\n+\n+\n+If you expect all these combination to occur in your data you need to combine these patterns in 7.0\n+[source,txt]\n+--------------------------------------------------\n+yyyy-MM-dd'T'hh:mm:ssX||yyyy-MM-dd'T'hh:mm:ssXXX||yyyy-MM-dd'T'hh:mm:ssXXXXX\n+--------------------------------------------------\n+\n+\n+The same applies if you expect your pattern to occur without a colon:\n+Pattern `YYYY-MM-dd'T'hh:mm:ssZ` accepting these dates:\n+```\n+2010-01-01T01:02:03Z\n+2010-01-01T01:02:03+01\n+2010-01-01T01:02:03+0102\n+2010-01-01T01:02:03+010203\n+```\n+should be migrated to\n+[source,txt]\n+--------------------------------------------------\n+yyyy-MM-dd'T'hh:mm:ssX||yyyy-MM-dd'T'hh:mm:ssXX||yyyy-MM-dd'T'hh:mm:ssXXXX\n+--------------------------------------------------\n+\n+===== d for day.\n+This one have the same meaning in 7.0 but are less flexible.\n+If your pattern was `YYYY-MM-dd` in 6.8 and you expects dates in form\n+`2010-01-01` or `2010-01-1`\n+You will need to provide an alternative pattern for all of these.\n+`yyyy-MM-dd||yyyy-MM-d`\n+More then 2 digits are not allowed anymore. If you want to parse dates like `2010-01-00001` you need to create a pattern that expects a text literal `'000'` before `'d'`\n+`yyyy-MM-'000'dd`\n+\n+===== e for name of day\n+Also has a similar meaning in 7.0. However was more flexible in 6.8 and allowed to parse short and full text forms.\n+if you used `EEE YYYY-MM` for a format and expected days in form:\n+Wed 2020-01 or Wednesday 2020-01\n+then you have to use two combined patterns in 7.0\n+`cccc yyyy-MM||ccc yyyy-MM`\n+\n+E vs c. E means day-of-week vs c is for localized day-of-week. The difference is that E won't behave correctly for full text forms like Wednesday\n+\n+===== more on text forms EEEE and similar\n+Full text forms are depending on locale data provided with JDK and the implementation details of java vs joda. You should test carefully before upgrading these patterns.\n+\n+===== 'z'\n+'z' time zone text. Will print 'Z' for Zulu given UTC timezone.\n+\n+\n+===== Test with your data\n+All of the examples above should be tested with real data. It is likely that you do not need the flexibility joda was giving.\n+If you expected your timezone to only be in `+01:00` form (XXX in java, ZZ in joda),\n+then there is no need to create a new java pattern with so many alternatives.\n+\n+Consider using this date debugging site for assistance https://esddd.herokuapp.com/\n+\n+==== Migrating affected mappings\n+Once an index is created with a mapping, it cannot change already existing fields. You need to create a new index with updated mapping\n+and reindex your data to it.\n+You can however update your pipelines or templates. Remember to look for templates you use with tools outside ES.\n+If you specified a custom date format there, then you need to update it too.\n+\n+===== Example migration procedure\n+Let's assume that you have an index with a date field and custom format\n+////\n+[source,console]\n+--------------------------------------------------\n+PUT my_index_1\n+{\n+    \"mappings\" : {\n+      \"properties\" : {\n+         \"datetime\": {\n+           \"type\": \"date\",\n+           \"format\": \"yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss||yyyy/MM/dd||epoch_millis\"\n+         }\n+      }\n+    }\n+}\n+--------------------------------------------------\n+\n+\n+[source,console]\n+--------------------------------------------------\n+GET my_index_1/_mapping\n+--------------------------------------------------\n+// TEST[continued]\n+\n+[source,js]\n+--------------------------------------------------\n+{\n+  \"my_index_1\" : {\n+    \"mappings\" : {\n+      \"properties\" : {\n+         \"datetime\": {\n+           \"type\": \"date\",\n+           \"format\": \"yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss||yyyy/MM/dd||epoch_millis\"\n+         }\n+      }\n+    }\n+  }\n+}\n+--------------------------------------------------\n+// NOTCONSOLE\n+\n+\n+* Create my_index_2 with mappings changed with the format set to 8uuuu/MM/dd HH:mm:ss||uuuu/MM/dd||epoch_millis\n+\n+[source,console]\n+--------------------------------------------------\n+PUT my_index_2\n+{\n+  \"mappings\": {\n+    \"properties\": {\n+      \"datetime\": {\n+        \"type\": \"date\",\n+        \"format\": \"8uuuu/MM/dd HH:mm:ss||uuuu/MM/dd||epoch_millis\"\n+      }\n+    }\n+  }\n+}\n+--------------------------------------------------\n+// TEST[continued]\n+\n+* Reindex the deprecated format index to new_index_1\n+\n+[source,console]\n+--------------------------------------------------\n+POST _reindex\n+{\n+  \"source\": {\n+    \"index\": \"my_index_1\"\n+  },\n+  \"dest\": {\n+    \"index\": \"my_index_2\"\n+  }\n+}\n+--------------------------------------------------\n+// TEST[continued]\n+\n+* If you were using aliases, update them to a new index\n+\n+[source,console]\n+--------------------------------------------------\n+POST /_aliases\n+{\n+    \"actions\" : [\n+        { \"remove\" : { \"index\" : \"my_index_1\", \"alias\" : \"my_index\" } },\n+        { \"add\" : { \"index\" : \"my_index_2\", \"alias\" : \"my_index\" } }\n+    ]\n+}\n+--------------------------------------------------\n+// TEST[continued]\n+\n+===== Update before upgrading to ES7.\n+* update pipeline", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "2cdf1eccbd4f3ab4c76b4c764423750817cfab05"}, "originalPosition": 239}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMjQ1MDIzODcxOnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "docs/reference/migration/migrate_7_0/migrate_to_java_time.asciidoc", "isResolved": true, "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMy0xOVQyMDo1MDoyNFrOF4_6xA==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMy0xOVQyMDo1MDoyNFrOF4_6xA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5NTMxMTgxMg==", "bodyText": "This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.
