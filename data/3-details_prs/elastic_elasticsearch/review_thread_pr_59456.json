By default,\n+this setting is configured to be 10% of the heap.\n+\n+At the beginning of each indexing stage, Elasticsearch accounts for the\n+bytes consumed by an indexing request. This accounting is only released at the\n+end of the indexing stage. This means that upstream stages will account for the\n+request overheard until all downstream stages are complete. For example, the\n+coordinating request will remain accounted for until primary and replica\n+stages are complete. The primary request will remain accounted for until each\n+in-sync replica has responded to enable replica retries if necessary.\n+\n+A node will start rejecting new indexing work at the coordinating or primary\n+stage when the number of outstanding coordinating, primary, and replica indexing\n+bytes are greater than the configured limit.\n+\n+A node will start rejecting new indexing work at the replica stage when the\n+number of outstanding replica indexing bytes are greater than 1.5x the\n+configured limit. This design means that as indexing pressure builds on nodes,\n+they will naturally stop accepting coordinating and primary work in favor of\n+outstanding replica work.\n+\n+The default limit `indexing_pressure.memory.limit` (10%) is generously sized and\n+should only be modified after careful consideration. Only indexing requests\n+contribute to this limit meaning that there is additional indexing overhead\n+(buffers, listeners, etc) which also require heap space. Finally, other\n+components of Elasticsearch also require memory. Configuring this limit to be\n+too high can starve other system components of operating memory.\n+\n+[float]\n+=== Monitoring\n+\n+Indexing pressure metrics are exposed by the\n+<<cluster-nodes-stats-api-response-body-indexing-pressure,Node Stats API>>.\n+\n+[float]\n+=== Indexing pressure settings\n+\n+`indexing_pressure`::\n+\n+  A configurable limit for the number of outstanding bytes consumed by indexing\n+  requests.
