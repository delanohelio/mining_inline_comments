We need to make sure\n-that our index name matches our index template pattern of \"datastream-*\",\n-which it does. We are using the <<ilm-rollover-action, Rollover Action>> in our policy, which\n-requires that our index name ends with a number. In our case, we used\n-`000001`. This is important so that Rollover can increment this number when\n-naming the new index created from rolling over.\n-\n-Our index creation request leverages its template to apply our settings,\n-but we must also configure our rollover alias: \"datastream\". To do this,\n-we take advantage of <<aliases-write-index,write indices>>. This is a way\n-to define an alias to be used for both reading and writing, with only one\n-index being the index that is being written to at a time. Rollover swaps\n-the write index to be the new index created from rollover, and sets the\n-alias to be read-only for the source index.\n+When the rollover conditions are met, the rollover action:\n+\n+* Creates a new index called `datastream-000002`. \n+This matches the `datastream-*` pattern, so the settings from `datastream_template` are applied to the new index.\n+* Designates the new index as the write index and makes the bootstrap index read-only.\n+\n+This process will repeat each time the rollover conditions are met. \n+You can search across all of the indices managed by the `datastream_policy` with the `datastream` alias. \n+Write operations are routed to the current write index. \n+\n+For more information about write indices and rollover, see the <<rollover-index-api-desc, Rollover API>>.\n \n [float]\n [[ilm-gs-check-progress]]\n === Checking progress\n \n-Now that we have an index managed by our policy, how do we tell what is going\n-on? Which phase are we in? Is something broken? This section will go over a\n-few APIs and their responses to help us inspect our indices with respect\n-to {ilm-init}.\n+To get status information for {ilm-init}-managed indices, you use the Explain API.
