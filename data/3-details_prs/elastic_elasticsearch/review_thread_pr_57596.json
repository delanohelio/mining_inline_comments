The other backing indices handle read requests. A data stream only\n+accepts <<docs-index_,index requests>> with `op_type` set to `create`. To update\n+or delete specific documents in a data stream, submit a <<docs-delete,delete>>\n+or <<docs-update,update>> API request to the backing index containing the\n+document.\n+\n+To create a data stream, set up a <<indices-templates,composable index\n+template>> containing:\n+\n+* Any desired index patterns in the `index_patterns` property. Indices that\n+  match these patterns are in the data stream's _namespace_.\n+* A `data_stream` definition that contains the `timestamp_field` property.\n+  The `timestamp_field` should be the primary timestamp field \n+   for the data source.\n+\n+When you index within a data stream's namespace, {es} automatically creates the\n+data stream using this template. You can also manually create a data stream using the\n+<<indices-create-data-stream,create data stream API>>. However, a composable\n+template for the stream is still required.\n+\n+You can use the <<indices-rollover-index,rollover API>> to roll a data stream\n+over to a new index when the current write index meets specified criteria, such\n+as a maximum age or size. A rollover creates a new backing index and updates the\n+data stream's list of backing indices. This new index then becomes the stream's\n+new write index.
