Recognizes `\"byte\"` as well as\n+  <<time-units,time units>>. By default, fields are assumed to not have a unit.\n+  This information may only be specified on numeric fields.\n+\n+metric_type::\n+\n+  The type of metric. Recognizes `\"gauge\"` and `\"counter\"`. A gauge is a\n+  single-valued measurement that can go up or down over time, such as a\n+  temperature. A counter is a single-valued cumulative counter that only goes\n+  up, such as the number of requests processed by a web server. By default,\n+  fields are assumed to not be a metric. This information may only be\n+  specified on numeric fields.\n+\n+ratio::\n+\n+  Whether the field is a ratio. Recognizes `true` and `false` (default). The\n+  value should not be `true` when a `unit` is also specified. This information\n+  may only be specified on numeric fields.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "b6dcdf5a216933003458f745b79006e2ea196a58"}, "originalPosition": 27}]}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 1722, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-12T13:16:51Z"}}}
