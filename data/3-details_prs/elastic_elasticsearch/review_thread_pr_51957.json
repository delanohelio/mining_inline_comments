The current \"direct\" handling kind of prioritizes the onRejection handling over everything else in the queue, which I think there is really no good reason for.\nLooking at various onRejection handlers, some call listener.onFailure and verifying that none of those do bad things is tricky.\nAlso notice that onAfter is also called in the caller thread when requests are rejected, this poses similar issues (not that I found a smoking gun there).\nFinally, notice that AbstractRunnable.onRejection by default calls onFailure.\nI doubt that we careful consider that onAfter and onFailure might run in the current thread when using AbstractRunnable and executing the onRejection handling on the target thread-pool would fix this, making it easier to reason about.\nThat said, I think this PR is good and I am not objecting to it going in.
