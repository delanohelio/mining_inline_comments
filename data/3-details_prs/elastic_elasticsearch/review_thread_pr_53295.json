It is passed through three layers of other objects, so in the future this could create confusion for maintainers of the innermost classes about what settings are available.  It makes me wonder if to avoid risk of future mistakes you should introduce a new class, say EvaluationParameters that has a member for each required parameter, so it will start off with just maxBuckets.  (Alternatively maxBuckets could just be passed through the three layers as an int, but I guess you were trying to future proof this so that fewer changes are needed when a second dynamic setting needs to be passed.  A bespoke class solves this while avoiding confusion about exactly which settings are included.)", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/53295#discussion_r390869986", "createdAt": "2020-03-11T10:19:25Z", "author": {"login": "droberts195"}, "path": "x-pack/plugin/ml/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/xpack/ml/action/TransportEvaluateDataFrameAction.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -48,7 +66,9 @@ protected void doExecute(Task task, EvaluateDataFrameAction.Request request,\n             listener::onFailure\n         );\n \n-        EvaluationExecutor evaluationExecutor = new EvaluationExecutor(threadPool, client, request);\n+        // Create a collection of settings to be used by evaluation metrics.
