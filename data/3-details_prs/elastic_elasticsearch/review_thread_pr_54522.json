We'd like to support derived keys properly and have an issue #52244 to track it. But we are still working out details on how we should approach the implementation. In the mean time, we decided to fix the bug temporarily by explicitly require no privilege should be specified at creation time for derived keys. This avoids the confusion that our users used to have.\nIn summary, currently there is no way to create derived keys with non-empty privileges. This has been the case since day 1 of the API key feature. The fix did not change this behaviour. It only tightens what you can specify in the input to avoid the false impression that you could create derived keys with non-empty privileges.\nDerived keys can still be used for the authentication API, i.e. GET /_security/_authenticate.
