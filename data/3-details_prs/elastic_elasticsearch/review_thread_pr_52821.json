You also currently run into the same problem if there are hyphens or special characters in the event type.\nOne thing we could do, is reuse or merge this section with the previous mention that documents that don't have an \"event type\" and can't that be queried with the form <event type> where <condition>, can use any where. I think it's good that you show cases where any where ...  is convenient, and also when it's necessary.", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/52821#discussion_r384977792", "createdAt": "2020-02-27T08:34:50Z", "author": {"login": "rw-access"}, "path": "docs/reference/eql/syntax.asciidoc", "diffHunk": "@@ -14,21 +14,59 @@ experimental::[]\n [[eql-basic-syntax]]\n === Basic syntax\n \n-EQL queries require an event type and a matching condition.
