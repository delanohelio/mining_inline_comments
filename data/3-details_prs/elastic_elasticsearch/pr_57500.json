Likewise, a field in the source will not contain\n+values that were copied into it through `copy_to`.\n+* Since the `_source` is stored as a single field in Lucene, the whole source\n+object must be loaded and parsed, even if only a small number of fields is needed.\n+\n+Elasticsearch supports some alternative methods for returning fields that help", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "79fc6bdec535f97c9910a7542ae1558180824d6c"}, "originalPosition": 20}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "9bcae385035fa58cfee94d5f3f4feecee5693d7b", "author": {"user": {"login": "jtibshirani", "name": "Julie Tibshirani"}}, "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/9bcae385035fa58cfee94d5f3f4feecee5693d7b", "committedDate": "2020-06-02T20:55:58Z", "message": "Reword text based on review feedback."}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "374305a96392ba1d03d12c38a5039704a36116e3", "author": {"user": {"login": "jtibshirani", "name": "Julie Tibshirani"}}, "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/374305a96392ba1d03d12c38a5039704a36116e3", "committedDate": "2020-06-02T20:57:55Z", "message": "Small tweak."}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 3937, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-10-28T18:54:27Z"}}}
