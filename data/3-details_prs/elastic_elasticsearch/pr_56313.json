Selects every possible value for a field. For\n+example, `*` in the `hours` field means \"every hour\".\n+\n+?::                \n+No specific value. Use when you don't care what the value\n+is. For example, if you want the schedule to trigger on a\n+particular day of the month, but don't care what day of\n+the week that happens to be, you can specify `?` in the\n+`day_of_week` field.\n+\n+-::                 \n+A range of values (inclusive). Use to separate a minimum\n+and maximum value. For example, if you want the schedule\n+to trigger every hour between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM, you\n+could specify  `9-17` in the `hours` field.\n+\n+,::\n+Multiple values. Use to separate multiple values for a\n+field. For example, if you want the schedule to trigger\n+every Tuesday and Thursday, you could specify `TUE,THU`\n+in the `day_of_week` field.\n+\n+/::\n+Increment. Use to separate values when specifying a time\n+increment. The first value represents the starting point,\n+and the second value represents the interval. For example,\n+if you want the schedule to trigger every 20 minutes\n+starting at the top of the hour, you could specify `0/20`\n+in the `minutes` field. Similarly, specifying `1/5` in\n+`day_of_month` field will trigger every 5 days starting on\n+the first day of the month.\n+\n+L::\n+Last. Use in the `day_of_month` field to mean the last day\n+of the month--day 31 for January, day 28 for February in\n+non-leap years, day 30 for April, and so on. Use alone in\n+the `day_of_week` field in place of `7` or `SAT`, or after\n+a particular day of the week to select the last day of that\n+type in the month. For example `6L` means the last Friday\n+of the month. You can specify `LW` in the `day_of_month`\n+field to specify the last weekday of the month. Avoid using\n+the `L` option when specifying lists or ranges of values,\n+as the results likely won't be what you expect.\n+\n+W::\n+Weekday. Use to specify the weekday (Monday-Friday) nearest\n+the given day. As an example, if you specify `15W` in the\n+`day_of_month` field and the 15th is a Saturday, the\n+schedule will trigger on the 14th. If the 15th is a Sunday,\n+the schedule will trigger on Monday the 16th. If the 15th\n+is a Tuesday, the schedule will trigger on Tuesday the 15th.\n+However if you specify `1W` as the value for `day_of_month`,\n+and the 1st is a Saturday, the schedule will trigger on\n+Monday the 3rd--it won't jump over the month boundary. You\n+can specify `LW` in the `day_of_month` field to specify the\n+last weekday of the month. You can only use the `W` option\n+when the `day_of_month` is a single day--it is not valid\n+when specifying a range or list of days.\n+\n+#::\n+Nth XXX day in a month. Use in the `day_of_week` field to\n+specify the nth XXX day of the month. For example, if you\n+specify `6#1`, the schedule will trigger on the first\n+Friday of the month. Note that if you specify `3#5` and\n+there are not 5 Tuesdays in a particular month, the\n+schedule won't trigger that month.\n+\n+[[cron-expression-examples]]\n+==== Examples\n+\n+[[cron-example-daily]]\n+===== Setting daily triggers\n+\n+`0 5 9 * * ?`::\n+Trigger at 9:05 AM UTC every day.\n+\n+`0 5 9 * * ? 2020`::\n+Trigger at 9:05 AM UTC every day during the year 2020.\n+\n+[[cron-example-range]]\n+===== Restricting triggers to a range of days or times\n+\n+`0 5 9 ? * MON-FRI`::\n+Trigger at 9:05 AM UTC Monday through Friday.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "16e13194361361e5cfba9101f257d49b9f3c5eda"}, "originalPosition": 141}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "a86a250d5eab5c05d61b59866531b34f831363f4", "author": {"user": {"login": "debadair", "name": null}}, "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/a86a250d5eab5c05d61b59866531b34f831363f4", "committedDate": "2020-05-12T21:07:58Z", "message": "Apply suggestions from code review\n\nCo-authored-by: James Rodewig <james.rodewig@elastic.co>"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "18d73f375a0b185c1870f01dfb8a944ea5c37ec7", "author": {"user": {"login": "debadair", "name": null}}, "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/18d73f375a0b185c1870f01dfb8a944ea5c37ec7", "committedDate": "2020-05-12T21:28:06Z", "message": "Incorporated review feedback"}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 182, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-10-28T18:54:27Z"}}}
