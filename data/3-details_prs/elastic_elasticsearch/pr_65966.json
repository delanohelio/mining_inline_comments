For each checkpoint, a {ctransform} detects changes in the \n+source data since the previous checkpoint, identifying the IPs for which new \n+data has been ingested. Then it performs a second search, filtered for this \n+group of IPs, in order to calculate the total `bytes_sent`. If this second \n+search matches many shards, then this could be resource intensive. Consider \n+limiting the scope that the source index pattern and query will match.\n+\n+Use an absolute time value as a date range filter in your source query (for \n+example, greater than `2020-01-01T00:00:00`) to limit which historical indices \n+are accessed. If you use a relative time value (for example, `now-30d`) then \n+this date range is re-evaluated at the point of each checkpoint execution.\n+\n+\n+[discrete]\n+[[optimize-shading-strategy]]\n+== 5. Optimize the sharding strategy for the source index (search)\n+\n+There is no one-size-fits-all sharding strategy. A strategy that works in one \n+environment may not scale in another. A good sharding strategy must account for \n+your infrastructure, use case, and performance expectations.\n+\n+Too few shards may mean that the benefits of distributing the workload cannot be \n+realised; however too many shards may impact your cluster health.

Tune `max_page_search_size` (search)\n+\n+The `max_page_search_size` {transform} configuration option defines the number \n+of buckets that are returned for each search request. The default value is 500. \n+If you increase this value, you get better throughput at the cost of higher \n+latency and memory usage.\n+\n+The ideal value of this parameter is highly dependent on your use case. If your \n+{transform} executes memory-intensive aggregations \u2013 for example, cardinality or \n+percentiles \u2013 then increasing `max_page_search_size` requires more available \n+memory. If memory limits are exceeded, a circuit breaker exception occurs.\n+\n+\n+[discrete]\n+[[indexed-fields-in-source]]\n+== 7. Use indexed fields in your source indices (search)\n+\n+Scripted fields are not indexed fields; their values are only \n+ computed at search time.
