With runtime fields, you can explicitly define a field\n+in the mapping and access it at search time without indexing your data during\n+ingest time.\n+\n+Runtime fields beta[] are accessible from the search API like any other field that has\n+<<doc-values,doc_values>> and is searchable. You can retrieve and query these\n+fields, as well as aggregate on them.\n+\n+Runtime fields help to alleviate several common issues when using {es}:\n+\n+* Reindexing your data between development iterations is slow and can make\n+experimenting on large datasets difficult\n+* Indexing data before searching makes running one-off searches costly and\n+resource intensive\n+* Indexing all of your data instead of just the fields you want to search\n+requires more disk space to gain search time performance\n+* Reindexing data for time-based indices to ensure that existing indices\n+include any new fields in the index template is slow\n+* Determining how a field is evaluated in {kib} at index or search time is\n+difficult for scripted fields because they have different needs based on where\n+they are implemented\n+\n+Because runtime fields aren't indexed, you can more quickly ingest raw data\n+into the Elastic Stack and immediately access it. By dynamically evaluating\n+runtime fields at search time, you can optimize disk space by choosing which\n+fields to index. You can also fix errors in indexed fields by overriding them\n+with runtime fields, rather than reindexing all of your data. If you later\n+decide that a runtime field is increasingly used for filtering or aggregation,\n+you can remove the runtime field from the mapping and index the field to gain\n+faster search speed.\n+\n+Runtime fields incur performance costs at search time, depending\n+on the <<runtime-params-runtime-type,`runtime_type`>>. For example, let's say\n+you created an anomaly detection job that operates on the `@timestamp` field.\n+If the `@timestamp` field is a runtime field, the search cost would be extremely\n+high because the data isn't indexed and {es} must compute the value for each\n+document that matches the query.\n+\n+Runtime fields are useful when working with log data, especially when you're\n+unsure about the data structure. Your search speed decreases, but your index\n+size is much smaller and you can more quickly process logs without having to\n+index them.\n+\n+[[runtime-mapping-fields]]\n+==== Mapping a runtime field\n+When mapping a runtime field, indexing is disabled by default. You map runtime\n+fields by <<modules-scripting-using,defining a painless script>>. At search\n+time, the script runs and generates values for each scripted field.

With runtime fields, you can explicitly define a field\n+in the mapping and access it at search time without indexing your data during\n+ingest time.\n+\n+Runtime fields beta[] are accessible from the search API like any other field that has\n+<<doc-values,doc_values>> and is searchable. You can retrieve and query these\n+fields, as well as aggregate on them.\n+\n+Runtime fields help to alleviate several common issues when using {es}:\n+\n+* Reindexing your data between development iterations is slow and can make\n+experimenting on large datasets difficult\n+* Indexing data before searching makes running one-off searches costly and\n+resource intensive\n+* Indexing all of your data instead of just the fields you want to search\n+requires more disk space to gain search time performance\n+* Reindexing data for time-based indices to ensure that existing indices\n+include any new fields in the index template is slow\n+* Determining how a field is evaluated in {kib} at index or search time is\n+difficult for scripted fields because they have different needs based on where\n+they are implemented\n+\n+Because runtime fields aren't indexed, you can more quickly ingest raw data\n+into the Elastic Stack and immediately access it. By dynamically evaluating\n+runtime fields at search time, you can optimize disk space by choosing which\n+fields to index. You can also fix errors in indexed fields by overriding them\n+with runtime fields, rather than reindexing all of your data. If you later\n+decide that a runtime field is increasingly used for filtering or aggregation,\n+you can remove the runtime field from the mapping and index the field to gain\n+faster search speed.\n+\n+Runtime fields incur performance costs at search time, depending\n+on the <<runtime-params-runtime-type,`runtime_type`>>. For example, let's say\n+you created an anomaly detection job that operates on the `@timestamp` field.\n+If the `@timestamp` field is a runtime field, the search cost would be extremely\n+high because the data isn't indexed and {es} must compute the value for each\n+document that matches the query.\n+\n+Runtime fields are useful when working with log data, especially when you're\n+unsure about the data structure. Your search speed decreases, but your index\n+size is much smaller and you can more quickly process logs without having to\n+index them.\n+\n+[[runtime-mapping-fields]]\n+==== Mapping a runtime field\n+When mapping a runtime field, indexing is disabled by default. You map runtime\n+fields by <<modules-scripting-using,defining a painless script>>. At search\n+time, the script runs and generates values for each scripted field.

Use the <<async-search,asynchronous search API>>\n+to run searches that include runtime fields.\n+\n+Runtime fields are useful when working with log data, especially when you're\n+unsure about the data structure. Your search speed decreases, but your index\n+size is much smaller and you can more quickly process logs without having to\n+index them.\n+\n+[[runtime-mapping-fields]]\n+==== Mapping a runtime field\n+You map runtime fields by adding a `\"runtime\"` section under the mapping\n+definition.

You can retrieve the results of running a script, but\n+also make the script results available for queries and aggregations.\n+\n+[[runtime-updating-scripts]]\n+.Updating runtime scripts\n+****\n+\n+Updating a script while a dependent query is running can return\n+inconsistent results. Each shard might have access to different versions of the\n+script, depending on when the mapping change takes effect.\n+\n+Existing queries or visualizations in {kib} that rely on runtime fields can\n+fail if you change the `runtime_type`.

For example, let's say\n+you created an anomaly detection job that operates on the `@timestamp` field.\n+If the `@timestamp` field is a runtime field, the search cost would be extremely\n+high because the data isn't indexed and {es} must compute the value for each\n+document that matches the query.\n+\n+NOTE: Computing values for runtime fields in each document that might match a\n+query impacts search speed.

With _runtime fields_ beta[], you can explicitly\n+define a field in the mapping and access it at search time without indexing\n+your data during ingest time.\n+\n+Because runtime fields aren't indexed, you can more quickly ingest raw data\n+into the Elastic Stack and access it immediately. Runtime fields are accessible\n+from the search API like any other field. The <<search-field-caps,field capabilities API>> returns runtime fields as both searchable and aggregatable.\n+\n+By dynamically evaluating runtime fields at search time, you can optimize disk\n+space by choosing which fields to index. If you later decide that a runtime\n+field is increasingly used for filtering or aggregation, you can add the field\n+to `_source` to gain faster search speed.\n+\n+Alternatively, you can specify a `runtime_mappings` section in a search request\n+to use runtime fields that exist only as part of the query. This\n+flexibility allows you to create or override field values in `_source` for the\n+duration of the query without modifying the field itself.\n+\n+Runtime fields help to alleviate several common issues when using {es}:\n+\n+* Reindexing your data between development iterations is slow and can make\n+experimenting on large datasets difficult\n+* Indexing data before searching makes running one-off searches costly and\n+resource intensive\n+* Indexing all of your data instead of just the fields you want to search\n+requires more disk space to gain performance at search time\n+* Reindexing data for time-based indices to ensure that existing indices\n+include any new fields in the index template is slow\n+* Determining how a field is evaluated in {kib} at index or search time is\n+difficult for scripted fields because they have different needs based on where\n+they are implemented\n+\n+Runtime fields incur performance costs at search time, depending\n+on the <<runtime-params-runtime-type,`runtime_type`>>. For example, let's say\n+you created an anomaly detection job that operates on the `@timestamp` field.\n+If the `@timestamp` field is a runtime field, the search cost would be extremely\n+high because the data isn't indexed and {es} must compute the value for each\n+document that matches the query.\n+\n+NOTE: Computing values for runtime fields in each document that might match a\n+query impacts search speed. Use the <<async-search,asynchronous search API>>\n+to run searches that include runtime fields.\n+\n+Runtime fields are useful when working with log data, especially when you're\n+unsure about the data structure. Your search speed decreases, but your index\n+size is much smaller and you can more quickly process logs without having to\n+index them.\n+\n+[[runtime-mapping-fields]]\n+==== Mapping a runtime field\n+You map runtime fields by adding a `\"runtime\"` section under the mapping\n+definition. Within that section, you\n+<<modules-scripting-using,define a Painless script>>, which has access to the\n+entire context of a document, the original `_source`, and the mapped field plus\n+its values (`doc_values`). At search time, the script runs and generates values\n+for each scripted field.\n+\n+Runtime fields are similar to the <<script-fields,`script_fields`>> parameter\n+of the `_search` request. You can retrieve the results of running a script, but\n+also make the script results available for queries and aggregations.\n+\n+[[runtime-updating-scripts]]\n+.Updating runtime scripts\n+****\n+\n+Updating a script while a dependent query is running can return\n+inconsistent results. Each shard might have access to different versions of the\n+script, depending on when the mapping change takes effect.\n+\n+Existing queries or visualizations in {kib} that rely on runtime fields can\n+fail if you change the `runtime_type`.

With _runtime fields_ beta[], you can explicitly\n+define a field in the mapping and access it at search time without indexing\n+your data during ingest time.\n+\n+Because runtime fields aren't indexed, you can more quickly ingest raw data\n+into the Elastic Stack and access it immediately. Runtime fields are accessible\n+from the search API like any other field. The <<search-field-caps,field capabilities API>> returns runtime fields as both searchable and aggregatable.\n+\n+By dynamically evaluating runtime fields at search time, you can optimize disk\n+space by choosing which fields to index. If you later decide that a runtime\n+field is increasingly used for filtering or aggregation, you can add the field\n+to `_source` to gain faster search speed.\n+\n+Alternatively, you can specify a `runtime_mappings` section in a search request\n+to use runtime fields that exist only as part of the query. This\n+flexibility allows you to create or override field values in `_source` for the\n+duration of the query without modifying the field itself.\n+\n+Runtime fields help to alleviate several common issues when using {es}:\n+\n+* Reindexing your data between development iterations is slow and can make\n+experimenting on large datasets difficult\n+* Indexing data before searching makes running one-off searches costly and\n+resource intensive\n+* Indexing all of your data instead of just the fields you want to search\n+requires more disk space to gain performance at search time\n+* Reindexing data for time-based indices to ensure that existing indices\n+include any new fields in the index template is slow\n+* Determining how a field is evaluated in {kib} at index or search time is\n+difficult for scripted fields because they have different needs based on where\n+they are implemented\n+\n+Runtime fields incur performance costs at search time, depending\n+on the <<runtime-params-runtime-type,`runtime_type`>>. For example, let's say\n+you created an anomaly detection job that operates on the `@timestamp` field.\n+If the `@timestamp` field is a runtime field, the search cost would be extremely\n+high because the data isn't indexed and {es} must compute the value for each\n+document that matches the query.\n+\n+NOTE: Computing values for runtime fields in each document that might match a\n+query impacts search speed. Use the <<async-search,asynchronous search API>>\n+to run searches that include runtime fields.\n+\n+Runtime fields are useful when working with log data, especially when you're\n+unsure about the data structure. Your search speed decreases, but your index\n+size is much smaller and you can more quickly process logs without having to\n+index them.\n+\n+[[runtime-mapping-fields]]\n+==== Mapping a runtime field\n+You map runtime fields by adding a `\"runtime\"` section under the mapping\n+definition. Within that section, you\n+<<modules-scripting-using,define a Painless script>>, which has access to the\n+entire context of a document, the original `_source`, and the mapped field plus\n+its values (`doc_values`). At search time, the script runs and generates values\n+for each scripted field.\n+\n+Runtime fields are similar to the <<script-fields,`script_fields`>> parameter\n+of the `_search` request. You can retrieve the results of running a script, but\n+also make the script results available for queries and aggregations.\n+\n+[[runtime-updating-scripts]]\n+.Updating runtime scripts\n+****\n+\n+Updating a script while a dependent query is running can return\n+inconsistent results. Each shard might have access to different versions of the\n+script, depending on when the mapping change takes effect.\n+\n+Existing queries or visualizations in {kib} that rely on runtime fields can\n+fail if you change the `runtime_type`.

However, indexing\n+can be slow and requires more disk space, and you have to reindex your data to\n+add fields to existing documents. With _runtime fields_, you can add\n+fields to documents already indexed to {es} without reindexing your data.\n+\n+[discrete]\n+[[runtime-benefits]]\n+=== Benefits\n+Because runtime fields aren't indexed, you can more quickly ingest raw data\n+into the Elastic Stack and access it immediately. By dynamically evaluating\n+runtime fields at search time, you can optimize disk space by choosing which\n+fields to index. If you later decide that a runtime field is increasingly used\n+for filtering or aggregation, you can add the field to `_source` to gain faster\n+search speed.\n+\n+Instead of reindexing your data to add fields, add runtime fields to the\n+mapping definition. You can access runtime fields from the search API like any\n+other field, and {es} sees runtime fields no differently.\n+\n+Alternatively, you can specify a `runtime_mappings` section in a search request\n+to use runtime fields that exist only as part of the query. This\n+flexibility allows you to create or shadow field values in `_source` for the\n+duration of the query without modifying the field itself.\n+\n+[discrete]\n+[[runtime-use-cases]]\n+=== Use cases\n+Runtime fields are useful when working with log data\n+(see <<runtime-examples,examples>>), especially when you're unsure about the\n+data structure. Your search speed decreases, but your index size is much\n+smaller and you can more quickly process logs without having to index them.\n+\n+Runtime fields are especially useful in the following contexts:\n+\n+* Adding fields to documents that are already indexed without having to reindex\n+data\n+* Immediately begin working on a new data stream without fully understanding\n+the data it contains\n+* Shadowing an indexed field with a runtime field to fix a mistake after\n+indexing documents\n+* Defining fields that are only relevant for a particular context (such as a\n+visualization in {kib}) without influencing the underlying schema\n+\n+[discrete]\n+[[runtime-compromises]]\n+=== Compromises\n+Runtime fields use less disk space and provide flexibility in how you access\n+your data, but can impact search performance based on the computation defined in\n+the runtime script.\n+\n+To balance search performance and flexibility, index fields that you'll\n+commonly search for and filter on, such as a timestamp. {es} automatically uses\n+these indexed fields first when running a query, resulting in a fast response\n+time. You can then use runtime fields to limit the number of fields that {es}\n+needs to calculate values for. Using indexed fields in tandem with runtime\n+fields provides flexibility in the data that you index and how you define\n+queries for other fields.\n+\n+Use the <<async-search,asynchronous search API>> to run searches that include\n+runtime fields. This method of search helps to offset the performance impacts\n+of computing values for runtime fields in each document containing that field.\n+\n+IMPORTANT: Queries against runtime fields are considered expensive. If\n+<<query-dsl-allow-expensive-queries,`search.allow_expensive_queries`>> is set\n+to `false`, expensive queries are not allowed and {es} will reject any queries\n+against runtime fields.\n+\n+[discrete]\n+[[runtime-mapping-fields]]\n+=== Mapping a runtime field\n+You map runtime fields by adding a `\"runtime\"` section under the mapping\n+definition. Within that section, you\n+<<modules-scripting-using,define a Painless script>>, which has access to the\n+original `_source` and `doc_values` (the mapped field plus its values). At\n+search time, the script runs and generates values for each scripted field.\n+\n+NOTE: You can define a runtime field in the mapping definition without a\n+script. {es} will look in `_source` for a field with the same name as the\n+runtime field and use values from that field at query time.\n+\n+Runtime fields are similar to the <<script-fields,`script_fields`>> parameter\n+of the `_search` request, but also make the script results available for\n+queries and aggregations.\n+\n+The script in the following request extracts the day of the week from the\n+`@timestamp` field, which is defined as a `date` type:\n+\n+[source,console]\n+----\n+PUT /my-index\n+{\n+  \"mappings\": {\n+    \"runtime\": { <1>\n+      \"day_of_week\": {\n+        \"type\": \"keyword\", <2>\n+        \"script\": { <3>\n+          \"source\": \"emit(doc['@timestamp'].value.dayOfWeekEnum.getDisplayName(TextStyle.FULL, Locale.ROOT))\"\n+        }\n+      }\n+    },\n+    \"properties\": {\n+      \"timestamp\": {\"type\": \"date\"}\n+    }\n+  }\n+}\n+----\n+\n+<1> Runtime fields are defined in the `\"runtime\"` section of the mapping\n+definition.\n+<2> Each runtime has its own field type, just like any other field.\n+<3> The script defines the evaluation to calculate at search time.\n+\n+The `\"runtime\"` section supports `boolean`, `date`, `double`, `ip`, `keyword`,\n+and `long` data types. Runtime fields with a `type` of `date` can accept the\n+<<mapping-date-format,`format`>> parameter exactly as the `date` field type.\n+\n+IMPORTANT: Objects are not supported in the `\"runtime\"` section under the\n+mapping definition.

Each shard might have access to different versions of the\n+script, depending on when the mapping change takes effect.\n+\n+Existing queries or visualizations in {kib} that rely on runtime fields can\n+fail if you change the field type. For example, a bar chart visualization\n+that uses a runtime field of type `ip` will fail if the type is changed\n+to `boolean`.\n+\n+****\n+\n+[discrete]\n+[[runtime-search-request]]\n+=== Defining runtime fields in a search request\n+You can specify a `runtime_mappings` section in a search request to create\n+runtime fields that exist only as part of the query.

However, indexing\n+can be slow and requires more disk space, and you have to reindex your data to\n+add fields to existing documents. With _runtime fields_, you can add\n+fields to documents already indexed to {es} without reindexing your data.\n+\n+[discrete]\n+[[runtime-benefits]]\n+=== Benefits\n+Because runtime fields aren't indexed, you can more quickly ingest raw data\n+into the Elastic Stack and access it immediately. By dynamically evaluating\n+runtime fields at search time, you can optimize disk space by choosing which\n+fields to index. If you later decide that a runtime field is increasingly used\n+for filtering or aggregation, you can add the field to `_source` to gain faster\n+search speed.\n+\n+Instead of reindexing your data to add fields, add runtime fields to the\n+mapping definition. You can access runtime fields from the search API like any\n+other field, and {es} sees runtime fields no differently.\n+\n+Alternatively, you can specify a `runtime_mappings` section in a search request\n+to use runtime fields that exist only as part of the query. This\n+flexibility allows you to create or shadow field values in `_source` for the\n+duration of the query without modifying the field itself.\n+\n+[discrete]\n+[[runtime-use-cases]]\n+=== Use cases\n+Runtime fields are useful when working with log data\n+(see <<runtime-examples,examples>>), especially when you're unsure about the\n+data structure. Your search speed decreases, but your index size is much\n+smaller and you can more quickly process logs without having to index them.\n+\n+Runtime fields are especially useful in the following contexts:\n+\n+* Adding fields to documents that are already indexed without having to reindex\n+data\n+* Immediately begin working on a new data stream without fully understanding\n+the data it contains\n+* Shadowing an indexed field with a runtime field to fix a mistake after\n+indexing documents\n+* Defining fields that are only relevant for a particular context (such as a\n+visualization in {kib}) without influencing the underlying schema\n+\n+[discrete]\n+[[runtime-compromises]]\n+=== Compromises\n+Runtime fields use less disk space and provide flexibility in how you access\n+your data, but can impact search performance based on the computation defined in\n+the runtime script.\n+\n+To balance search performance and flexibility, index fields that you'll\n+commonly search for and filter on, such as a timestamp. {es} automatically uses\n+these indexed fields first when running a query, resulting in a fast response\n+time. You can then use runtime fields to limit the number of fields that {es}\n+needs to calculate values for. Using indexed fields in tandem with runtime\n+fields provides flexibility in the data that you index and how you define\n+queries for other fields.\n+\n+Use the <<async-search,asynchronous search API>> to run searches that include\n+runtime fields. This method of search helps to offset the performance impacts\n+of computing values for runtime fields in each document containing that field.\n+\n+IMPORTANT: Queries against runtime fields are considered expensive. If\n+<<query-dsl-allow-expensive-queries,`search.allow_expensive_queries`>> is set\n+to `false`, expensive queries are not allowed and {es} will reject any queries\n+against runtime fields.\n+\n+[discrete]\n+[[runtime-mapping-fields]]\n+=== Mapping a runtime field\n+You map runtime fields by adding a `\"runtime\"` section under the mapping\n+definition. Within that section, you\n+<<modules-scripting-using,define a Painless script>>, which has access to the\n+original `_source` and `doc_values` (the mapped field plus its values). At\n+search time, the script runs and generates values for each scripted field.\n+\n+NOTE: You can define a runtime field in the mapping definition without a\n+script. {es} will look in `_source` for a field with the same name as the\n+runtime field and use values from that field at query time.\n+\n+Runtime fields are similar to the <<script-fields,`script_fields`>> parameter\n+of the `_search` request, but also make the script results available for\n+queries and aggregations.\n+\n+The script in the following request extracts the day of the week from the\n+`@timestamp` field, which is defined as a `date` type:\n+\n+[source,console]\n+----\n+PUT /my-index\n+{\n+  \"mappings\": {\n+    \"runtime\": { <1>\n+      \"day_of_week\": {\n+        \"type\": \"keyword\", <2>\n+        \"script\": { <3>\n+          \"source\": \"emit(doc['@timestamp'].value.dayOfWeekEnum.getDisplayName(TextStyle.FULL, Locale.ROOT))\"\n+        }\n+      }\n+    },\n+    \"properties\": {\n+      \"timestamp\": {\"type\": \"date\"}\n+    }\n+  }\n+}\n+----\n+\n+<1> Runtime fields are defined in the `\"runtime\"` section of the mapping\n+definition.\n+<2> Each runtime has its own field type, just like any other field.\n+<3> The script defines the evaluation to calculate at search time.\n+\n+The `\"runtime\"` section supports `boolean`, `date`, `double`, `ip`, `keyword`,\n+and `long` data types. Runtime fields with a `type` of `date` can accept the\n+<<mapping-date-format,`format`>> parameter exactly as the `date` field type.\n+\n+IMPORTANT: Objects are not supported in the `\"runtime\"` section under the\n+mapping definition. If you want to map a runtime field under an object, you\n+can\n+<<runtime-shadowing-fields,shadow the field value in the search request>>.\n+\n+[[runtime-updating-scripts]]\n+.Updating runtime scripts\n+****\n+\n+Updating a script while a dependent query is running can return\n+inconsistent results. Each shard might have access to different versions of the\n+script, depending on when the mapping change takes effect.\n+\n+Existing queries or visualizations in {kib} that rely on runtime fields can\n+fail if you change the field type. For example, a bar chart visualization\n+that uses a runtime field of type `ip` will fail if the type is changed\n+to `boolean`.\n+\n+****\n+\n+[discrete]\n+[[runtime-search-request]]\n+=== Defining runtime fields in a search request\n+You can specify a `runtime_mappings` section in a search request to create\n+runtime fields that exist only as part of the query. You specify a script\n+as part of the `runtime_mappings` section, just as you would if adding a\n+runtime field to the mappings.\n+\n+In the following request, the values for the `day_of_week` field are calculated\n+dynamically, and only within the context of this search request:\n+\n+[source,console]\n+----\n+GET my-index/_search\n+{\n+  \"runtime_mappings\": {\n+    \"day_of_week\": {\n+      \"type\": \"keyword\",\n+      \"script\": {\n+        \"source\": \"emit(doc['@timestamp'].value.dayOfWeekEnum.getDisplayName(TextStyle.FULL, Locale.ROOT))\"\n+      }\n+    }\n+  },\n+  \"aggs\": {\n+    \"day_of_week\": {\n+      \"terms\": {\n+        \"field\": \"day_of_week\"\n+      }\n+    }\n+  }\n+}\n+----\n+// TEST[continued]\n+\n+[discrete]\n+[[runtime-shadowing-fields]]\n+==== Shadowing fields in the search request\n+If you create a runtime field with the same name as a field that\n+already exists in the mapping, the runtime field shadows the mapped field. At\n+search time, {es} calculates the value of the runtime field and returns it as\n+part of the query. Because the runtime field shadows the mapped field, you can\n+modify the value returned in search without modifying the mapped field.\n+\n+Objects are not supported in the `\"runtime\"` section under the\n+mapping definition. However, you can use the `runtime_mappings` section of the\n+`_search` request to shadow field values inside objects. For\n+example, index the following documents into `my-index`:\n+\n+[source, console]\n+----\n+POST my-index/_bulk?refresh=true\n+{\"index\":{}}\n+{\"name\":{\"first\":\"Jose\",\"last\":\"Hickman\"}}\n+{\"index\":{}}\n+{\"name\":{\"first\":\"India\",\"last\":\"Avila\",\"suffix\":\"II\"}}\n+----\n+\n+In the `runtime_mappings` section of the `_search` request, you can define a\n+script that operates on the `name.first` field. The values you specify will\n+shadow field values in `_source` for the duration of the query without\n+modifying the field itself.\n+\n+The following request evaluates the `name.last` field and shadows the value for\n+the `name.first` field in the search request based on the script valuation:\n+\n+[source,console]\n+----\n+POST my-index/_search\n+{\n+  \"runtime_mappings\": {\n+    \"name.first\": {\n+      \"type\": \"keyword\",\n+      \"script\": {\n+        \"source\": \"if (\\\"Hickman\\\".equals(doc[\\\"name.last.keyword\\\"].value)) {emit(\\\"Guile\\\");} else if (\\\"Avila\\\".equals(doc[\\\"name.last.keyword\\\"].value)) {emit(\\\"Anastasia\\\");}\"\n+      }\n+    }\n+  },\n+  \"query\": {\n+    \"match\": {\n+      \"name.first\": \"Anastasia\"\n+    }\n+  }\n+}\n+----\n+// TEST[continued]\n+\n+[discrete]\n+[[runtime-retrieving-fields]]\n+==== Retrieving a runtime field\n+Use the <<search-fields,`fields`>> parameter on the `_search` API to retrieve\n+the values of runtime fields.

The value for the `day_of_week` field is calculated dynamically\n+at search time based on the evaluation of the defined script.\n+\n+[source,console]\n+----\n+GET my-index/_search\n+{\n+  \"fields\": [\n+    \"@timestamp\",\n+    \"day_of_week\"\n+  ],\n+  \"_source\": false\n+}\n+----\n+// TEST[continued]\n+\n+[discrete]\n+[[runtime-examples]]\n+=== Examples\n+Consider a large set of log data that you want to extract fields from.\n+Indexing the data is time consuming and uses a lot of disk space, and you just\n+want to explore the data structure without committing to a schema up front.\n+\n+You know that your log data contains specific fields that you want to extract.\n+By using runtime fields, you can define scripts to calculate values at search\n+time for these fields.\n+\n+You can start with a simple example by adding the `@timestamp` and `message`\n+fields to the `my-index` mapping. To remain flexible, use `wildcard` as the\n+field type for `message`:\n+\n+[source,console]\n+----\n+PUT /my-index/\n+{\n+  \"mappings\": {\n+    \"properties\": {\n+      \"@timestamp\": {\n+        \"format\": \"strict_date_optional_time||epoch_second\",\n+        \"type\": \"date\"\n+      },\n+      \"message\": {\n+        \"type\": \"wildcard\"\n+      }\n+    }\n+  }\n+}\n+----\n+\n+After mapping the fields you want to retrieve, index a few records from\n+your log data into {es}.

Field and object mappings, as well as\n-    field aliases count towards this limit.

Higher values can lead to performance degradations and memory issues,\n-especially in clusters with a high load or few resources.\n-\n-If you increase this setting, we recommend you also increase the\n-<<search-settings,`indices.query.bool.max_clause_count`>> setting, which\n-limits the maximum number of <<query-dsl-bool-query,boolean clauses>> in a query.\n-====\n-+\n-[TIP]\n-====\n-If your field mappings contain a large, arbitrary set of keys, consider using the <<flattened,flattened>> data type.\n-====\n-\n-`index.mapping.depth.limit`::\n-    The maximum depth for a field, which is measured as the number of inner\n-    objects. For instance, if all fields are defined at the root object level,\n-    then the depth is `1`. If there is one object mapping, then the depth is\n-    `2`, etc. Default is `20`.\n-\n-// tag::nested-fields-limit[]\n-`index.mapping.nested_fields.limit`::\n-    The maximum number of distinct `nested` mappings in an index. The `nested` type should only be used in special cases, when arrays of objects need to be queried independently of each other. To safeguard against poorly designed mappings, this setting\n-    limits the number of unique `nested` types per index. Default is `50`.\n-// end::nested-fields-limit[]\n-\n-// tag::nested-objects-limit[]\n-`index.mapping.nested_objects.limit`::\n-    The maximum number of nested JSON objects that a single document can contain across all\n-    `nested` types.

That consistency means you can promote a\n+runtime field from a search request to the index mapping by moving the field\n+definition from `runtime_mappings` in the search request to the `runtime`\n+section of the index mapping.\n+\n+[[runtime-shadowing-fields]]\n+=== Shadowing fields\n+If you create a runtime field with the same name as a field that\n+already exists in the mapping, the runtime field shadows the mapped field. At\n+search time, {es} evaluates the runtime field, calculates a value based on the\n+script, and returns the value as part of the query. Because the runtime field\n+shadows the mapped field, you can modify the value returned in search without\n+modifying the mapped field.\n+\n+If you define a runtime field that does not include a script, {es} evaluates the\n+field at search time, looks at each document containing that field, retrieves\n+the `_source`, and returns a value if one exists.\n+\n+As mentioned in <<runtime-mapping-fields,mapping a runtime field>>, you can\n+shadow field values inside objects. For example, index the following documents into `my-index`:\n+\n+[source, console]\n+----\n+POST my-index/_bulk?refresh=true\n+{\"index\":{}}\n+{\"name\":{\"first\":\"Jose\",\"last\":\"Hickman\"}}\n+{\"index\":{}}\n+{\"name\":{\"first\":\"India\",\"last\":\"Avila\",\"suffix\":\"II\"}}\n+----\n+\n+In the `runtime_mappings` section of the `_search` request, you can define a\n+script that operates on the `name.first` field.
