If the elected master node is overloaded with other tasks then the cluster may not operate well. In particular, indexing and searching your data can be very resource-intensive, so in large or high-throughput clusters it is a good idea to avoid using the master-eligible nodes for tasks such as indexing and searching. You can do this by configuring three of your nodes to be dedicated master-eligible nodes.
