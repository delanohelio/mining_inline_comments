The idea was that those fixes are made here, until the fixes are also made on Apache/Bookeeper side.\nLater, I had raised this PR apache/bookkeeper#2219 with the same fixes we made here in Pravega and the PR got merged there, so some of these customized functions aren't needed anymore. As such we can return back to having pravega/bookkeeper entrypoint.sh invoking apache/bookkeeper entrypoint.sh to start bookies (see how this changed in the entrypoint.sh diff in https://github.com/pravega/pravega/pull/4420/files0.\nNow, whether we do that change here while upgrading to Bookkeeper 4.11.x or do it separately in a different PR is an open question. I'd suggest doing that separately.
