This is because, currently there are a lot of tests which use a lot to classes to run thereby behaving more like integration tests as opposed to unit tests. It might be worth considering having a thirdeye-integration-tests module for these cases.", "createdAt": "2020-09-16T23:20:42Z", "url": "https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/6026", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "b5e67c9245ef83c5168959f13b6e9fd1687bb97a"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-09-21T23:26:30Z", "author": {"login": "suvodeep-pyne"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 11, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABdJk9VoABqjM3NzU0NDI5MjU=", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABdLL8_1gFqTQ5MzA0NjY5Mg==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "HeadRefForcePushedEvent", "beforeCommit": {"oid": "ee457f825c42c02287317e5d3bdaa966c0df7bb3", "author": {"user": {"login": "suvodeep-pyne", "name": "Suvodeep Pyne"}}, "url": "https://github.com/apache/pinot/commit/ee457f825c42c02287317e5d3bdaa966c0df7bb3", "committedDate": "2020-09-16T23:09:41Z", "message": "[TE] Moved Test classes from thirdeye-pinot to thirdeye-dashboard\n\nUpdated poms.
