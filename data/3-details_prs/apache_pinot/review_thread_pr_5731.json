It can ingest from batch data sources (such as Hadoop HDFS, Amazon S3, Azure ADLS, Google Cloud Storage) as well as stream data sources (such as Apache Kafka).\n+\n+Pinot was built by engineers at LinkedIn and Uber and is designed to scale up and out with no upper bound. Performance always remains constant based on the size of your cluster and an expected query per second (QPS) threshold.\n+\n+For getting started guides, deployment recipes, tutorials, and more, please visit our project documentation at [https://docs.pinot.apache.org](https://docs.pinot.apache.org).\n+\n+<img src=\"https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-LtH6nl58DdnZnelPdTc%2F-M69C48fK2BhCoou1REr%2F-M69DbDfcATcZOAgyX7k%2Fpinot-overview-graphic.png?alt=media&token=3552722e-8d1d-4397-972e-a81917ced182\" align=\"center\" alt=\"Apache Pinot\"/>\n+\n+## Features\n+\n+Pinot was originally built at LinkedIn to power rich interactive real-time analytic applications such as [Who Viewed Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/me/profile-views/urn:li:wvmp:summary/),  [Company Analytics](https://www.linkedin.com/company/linkedin/insights/),  [Talent Insights](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/talent-insights), and many more.

Example - Query (profile views, ad campaign performance, etc.) in an analytical fashion (who viewed this profile in the last weeks, how many ads were clicked per campaign). \n+Pinot is designed to execute real-time OLAP queries with low latency on massive amounts of data and events. In addition to real-time stream ingestion, Pinot also supports batch use cases with the same low latency guarantees. It is suited in contexts where fast analytics, such as aggregations, are needed on immutable data, possibly, with real-time data ingestion. Pinot works very well for querying time series data with lots of dimensions and metrics.\n \n-## Instructions to build Pinot\n+Example query:\n+```SQL\n+SELECT sum(clicks), sum(impressions) FROM AdAnalyticsTable\n+  WHERE\n+       ((daysSinceEpoch >= 17849 AND daysSinceEpoch <= 17856)) AND\n+       accountId IN (123456789)\n+  GROUP BY\n+       daysSinceEpoch TOP 100\n+```\n+\n+Pinot is not a replacement for database i.e it cannot be used as source of truth store, cannot mutate data. While Pinot [supports text search](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/basics/features/text-search-support), it's not a replacement for a search engine. Also, Pinot queries cannot span across multiple tables by default.
