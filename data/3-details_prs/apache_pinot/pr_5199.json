This PR removes the construction of second bitmap since earlier we had to do build the result in two phases -- (1) run search query to get luceneDocIDs in a bitmap. Iterate over this bitmap and build a second bitmap with corresponding pinotDocIds.\nNow in our Lucene collector callback, we can directly build the final bitmap.\nThis change along with previous PR provides significant performance improvements.\nRan an increasingQPS test on real data (single segment with 10million docs and a text index).
