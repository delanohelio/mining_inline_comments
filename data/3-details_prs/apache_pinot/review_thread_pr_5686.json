Given that we have fixed a bug in this part (related to refresh) we don't want additional flavors of it lurking around as we would have to fix any future bugs (or enhancements) in all these places. Any way to avoid this? You do have a base class, can that not be used to extract this out as a generic pattern?", "url": "https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/5686#discussion_r459062939", "createdAt": "2020-07-22T20:27:36Z", "author": {"login": "mayankshriv"}, "path": "pinot-core/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/core/operator/combine/BaseCombineOperator.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,190 @@\n+/**\n+ * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\n+ * or more contributor license agreements.
