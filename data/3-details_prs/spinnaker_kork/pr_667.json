For the matchArtifact case, we'll create an empty matchArtifact. As the point of a matchArtifact is to contain filters that determine whether a given artifact matches this expected artifact; by defaulting to no filters seems like a reasonable behavior here.\n\n\nrefactor(artifacts): Remove deprecated putMetadata\nLast time I updated this class (a few months ago) I added the Deprecated annotation to this function, which is not used anywhere in Spinnaker. Removing it now.\n\n\nrefactor(artifacts): Improve null-safety of Artifact class\nThe Artifact class contains a number of strings that are often null. To make the class more null-safe, annotate it with NonnullByDefault and translate any null values into the empty string in the constructor and in setters.\nIn order to do this null -> empty translation, we need to explicitly write out the constructor and the setters that were generated by lombok.\nWe rarely mutate artifacts; when we do it often leads to confusing and fragile logic because we often pass these many levels down in the call stack, and also sometimes convert to/from Map<> meaning that it's not always clear if you're operating on the same artifact or a copy. To greatly simplify this, I'd like to make this class immutable. Based on my analysis of where we mutate artifacts, the few places can all be replaced by either (1) fully specifying the artifact up-front or\n(2) returning a copy of the artifact with the desired mutations.\nTo start this process of making Artifact immutable, I've annotated all of the setters as Deprecated. Once all of the places where we call these are updated, I'll come back and actually remove the setters.\n\n\nrefactor(artifacts): Remove redundant JsonProperty\nThese are just explicitly specifying the default values (and in any case we're using the builder to deserialize).\n\n\nrefactor(artifacts): Clean up metadata creation\nThis is a tiny refactor to simplify creating the metadata in an Artifact builder; rather than check if the Map is null every time we add a key, just initialize it.\n\n\nrefactor(artifacts): Make Artifact final\nIf we want the class to truly be immutable in the future, it will need to be final.
