Security rules are annotated with CWE and OWASP metadata when applicable. OWASP rule coverage per language is displayed below.\n+All Semgrep rules can be viewed on the [Rule Registry page](https://semgrep.live/r), which pulls the rules from YAML files defined in the [semgrep-rules](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep-rules) GitHub repo.\n \n-<p align=\"center\">\n-    <img width=\"600\" src=\"https://web-assets.r2c.dev/semgrep-rules-owasp-coverage-20200520.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" />\n-</p>\n+Here are some sample vulnerable repos to test on:\n+* Django: [lets-be-bad-guys](https://github.com/mpirnat/lets-be-bad-guys), [django.nV](https://github.com/nVisium/django.nV)\n+* Flask: [Vulnerable-Flask-App](https://github.com/we45/Vulnerable-Flask-App)\n+* Java: [WebGoat](https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat), [OWASP Benchmark](https://github.com/OWASP/Benchmark)\n+* NodeJS: [OWASP Juice Shop](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop), [DevSlop Pixi](https://github.com/DevSlop/Pixi)\n+* Golang: [GoVWA](https://github.com/0c34/govwa)\n \n \n-#### Pattern Features\n+### \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f 2. Integrate into CI\n \n-`semgrep` patterns make use of two primary features:\n+Semgrep can be run via CLI or Docker and output results as JSON (via the `--json` flag), so it can be inserted into any CI pipeline and have its results processed by whatever tools you're using.\n \n-* **Metavariables like `$X`, `$WIDGET`, or `$USERS_2`.** Metavariable names can\n-only contain uppercase characters, or `_`, or digits, and must start with\n-an uppercase character or `_`. Names like `$x` or `$some_value` are\n-invalid.  Metavariables are used to track a variable across a specific code\n-scope.\n-* **The `...` (ellipsis) operator.** The ellipsis operator abstracts away\n-sequences of zero or more arguments, statements, characters, [and more](docs/pattern-features.md).\n+Semgrep is aware of *diffs*, so it can report only findings that occur in newly added code, for example, in a commit or pull request.\n \n-For example,\n-```yaml\n-$FILE = open(...)\n-```\n-will find all occurrences in your code where the result of an `open()` call with zero or more arguments is assigned\n-to a variable.\n+Currently, the easiest way to integrate Semgrep into CI is via a GitHub action we've built. See the [integrations docs](docs/integrations.md) for more details.\n \n-#### Composing Patterns\n+Semgrep can also output results in the standardized Static Analysis Results Interchange Format ([SARIF](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/cs01/sarif-v2.1.0-cs01.html)) with the `--sarif` flag, if you use tools that accept this format. \n \n-You can also construct rules by composing multiple patterns together.\n+### \u270d\ufe0f 3. Writing Rules\n \n-Let's consider an example:\n+One of the strengths of Semgrep is how easy it is to write rules.\n \n-```yaml\n-rules:\n-  - id: open-never-closed\n-    patterns:\n-      - pattern: $FILE = open(...)\n-      - pattern-not-inside: |\n-          $FILE = open(...)\n-          ...\n-          $FILE.close()\n-    message: \"file object opened without corresponding close\"\n-    languages: [python]\n-    severity: ERROR\n+This makes it possible to:\n+* Quickly port rules from other tools.\n+* Think of an interesting code pattern, and then find instances of it in your\n+    code.\n+* Find code base or org-specific bugs and antipatterns - things that built-in\n+    checks for existing tools won't find because they're unique to you.\n+* and more!\n+\n+#### Simple Rules\n+\n+For iterating on simple patterns, you can use the `--lang` and `--pattern`\n+flags.\n+\n+```bash\n+semgrep --lang javascript --pattern 'eval(...)' path/to/file.js\n ```\n \n-This rule looks for files that are opened but never closed. It accomplishes\n-this by looking for the `open(...)` pattern _and not_ a following `close()`\n-pattern. The `$FILE` metavariable ensures that the same variable name is used\n-in the `open` and `close` calls. The ellipsis operator allows for any arguments\n-to be passed to `open` and any sequence of code statements in-between the `open`\n-and `close` calls. We don't care how `open` is called or what happens up to\n-a `close` call, we just need to make sure `close` is called.\n+The `--lang` flag tells Semgrep which language you're targeting and `--pattern` is the code pattern to search for.\n \n-**For more information on rule fields like `patterns` and `pattern-not-inside`\n-see the [configuration documentation](docs/configuration-files.md).**\n+#### Advanced Rules\n \n-#### Equivalences\n+Some rules need more than one line of pattern to express.Sometimes you want to express code patterns, like: `X` must be true AND `Y` must be too, or `X` but NOT `Y`, or `X` must occur inside a block of code that `Y` matches.\n \n-Equivalences are another key concept in `semgrep`. `semgrep` automatically searches\n-for code that is semantically equivalent. For example, the following patterns\n-are semantically equivalent. The pattern `subprocess.Popen(...)` will fire on both.\n+For these cases, Semgrep has a more powerful and flexible [YAML syntax](docs/configuration-files.md).\n \n-```python\n-subprocess.Popen(\"ls\")\n+You can run a single rule or directory of rules specified in YAML by:\n+```bash\n+semgrep --config my_rule.yml path/to/dir_or_file\n+\n+semgrep --config yaml_dir/ path/to/dir_or_file\n ```\n \n-```python\n-from subprocess import Popen as sub_popen\n+**Example Advanced Rule**\n+\n+Let's say we are building a financial trading application in which every `Transaction` object must first be passed to `verify_transaction()` before being passed to `make_transaction()`, or it's a business logic bug.\n+\n+We can express this behavior with the following Semgrep YAML pattern:", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "6e24502ba50de118b730dd1e7e7305f5fc226e85"}, "originalPosition": 348}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzNzcwNjU4OA==", "bodyText": "Perhaps another way to phrase this that better matches the pattern of the other bullets:\n\nRuns on source code: Semgrep doesn\u2019t require compilation because it runs on source directly.", "url": "https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/pull/949#discussion_r437706588", "createdAt": "2020-06-09T20:44:17Z", "author": {"login": "pabloest"}, "path": "README.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -4,22 +4,116 @@\n [![r2c Community Slack](https://img.shields.io/badge/r2c_slack-join-brightgreen?style=flat&logo=slack&labelColor=4A154B)](https://join.slack.com/t/r2c-community/shared_invite/enQtNjU0NDYzMjAwODY4LWE3NTg1MGNhYTAwMzk5ZGRhMjQ2MzVhNGJiZjI1ZWQ0NjQ2YWI4ZGY3OGViMGJjNzA4ODQ3MjEzOWExNjZlNTA)\n [![r2c Twitter](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/r2cdev?label=Follow%20r2cdev&style=social&color=blue)](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=r2cdev)\n \n-`semgrep` is a tool for easily detecting and preventing bugs and anti-patterns in\n-your codebase.
