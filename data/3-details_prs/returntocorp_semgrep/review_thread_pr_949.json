Integrate into CI\n \n-`semgrep` patterns make use of two primary features:\n+Semgrep can be run via CLI or Docker and output results as JSON (via the `--json` flag), so it can be inserted into any CI pipeline and have its results processed by whatever tools you're using.\n \n-* **Metavariables like `$X`, `$WIDGET`, or `$USERS_2`.** Metavariable names can\n-only contain uppercase characters, or `_`, or digits, and must start with\n-an uppercase character or `_`. Names like `$x` or `$some_value` are\n-invalid.  Metavariables are used to track a variable across a specific code\n-scope.\n-* **The `...` (ellipsis) operator.** The ellipsis operator abstracts away\n-sequences of zero or more arguments, statements, characters, [and more](docs/pattern-features.md).\n+Semgrep is aware of *diffs*, so it can report only findings that occur in newly added code, for example, in a commit or pull request.\n \n-For example,\n-```yaml\n-$FILE = open(...)\n-```\n-will find all occurrences in your code where the result of an `open()` call with zero or more arguments is assigned\n-to a variable.\n+Currently, the easiest way to integrate Semgrep into CI is via a GitHub action we've built. See the [integrations docs](docs/integrations.md) for more details.\n \n-#### Composing Patterns\n+Semgrep can also output results in the standardized Static Analysis Results Interchange Format ([SARIF](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/cs01/sarif-v2.1.0-cs01.html)) with the `--sarif` flag, if you use tools that accept this format. \n \n-You can also construct rules by composing multiple patterns together.\n+### \u270d\ufe0f 3.
