Insecure code is easy to write\n-2. The future of security involves automatically guiding developers towards a \u201cpaved road\u201d made of default-safe frameworks (i.e. [React](https://reactjs.org/) or Object-relational Mappers)\n-3. `grep` isn\u2019t expressive enough and traditional static analysis tools (SAST) are too complicated/slow for paved road automation\n-\n-The AppSec, Developer, and DevOps communities deserve a static analysis tool that is fast, easy to use, code-aware, multi-lingual, and open source!\n-\n-## Overview\n-\n-Semgrep is optimized for:\n-\n-* **Speed**: Fast enough to run on every build, commit, or file save\n-* **Finding bugs that matter**: Run your own specialized rules or choose OWASP 10 checks from the [Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/r). Rules match source code at the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) level, unlike regexes that match strings and aren't semantically aware.\n-* **Ease of customization**: Rules look like the code you\u2019re searching, no static analysis PhD required. They don't require compiled code, only source, reducing iteration time.\n-* **Ease of integration**. Highly portable and many CI and git-hook integrations already exist.

Insecure code is easy to write\n-2. The future of security involves automatically guiding developers towards a \u201cpaved road\u201d made of default-safe frameworks (i.e. [React](https://reactjs.org/) or Object-relational Mappers)\n-3. `grep` isn\u2019t expressive enough and traditional static analysis tools (SAST) are too complicated/slow for paved road automation\n-\n-The AppSec, Developer, and DevOps communities deserve a static analysis tool that is fast, easy to use, code-aware, multi-lingual, and open source!\n-\n-## Overview\n-\n-Semgrep is optimized for:\n-\n-* **Speed**: Fast enough to run on every build, commit, or file save\n-* **Finding bugs that matter**: Run your own specialized rules or choose OWASP 10 checks from the [Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/r). Rules match source code at the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) level, unlike regexes that match strings and aren't semantically aware.\n-* **Ease of customization**: Rules look like the code you\u2019re searching, no static analysis PhD required. They don't require compiled code, only source, reducing iteration time.\n-* **Ease of integration**. Highly portable and many CI and git-hook integrations already exist. Output `--json` and pipe results into your existing systems.\n-* **Polyglot environments**: Don't learn and maintain multiple tools for your polyglot environment (e.g. ESLint, find-sec-bugs, RuboCop, Gosec).

Insecure code is easy to write\n-2. The future of security involves automatically guiding developers towards a \u201cpaved road\u201d made of default-safe frameworks (i.e. [React](https://reactjs.org/) or Object-relational Mappers)\n-3. `grep` isn\u2019t expressive enough and traditional static analysis tools (SAST) are too complicated/slow for paved road automation\n-\n-The AppSec, Developer, and DevOps communities deserve a static analysis tool that is fast, easy to use, code-aware, multi-lingual, and open source!\n-\n-## Overview\n-\n-Semgrep is optimized for:\n-\n-* **Speed**: Fast enough to run on every build, commit, or file save\n-* **Finding bugs that matter**: Run your own specialized rules or choose OWASP 10 checks from the [Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/r). Rules match source code at the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) level, unlike regexes that match strings and aren't semantically aware.\n-* **Ease of customization**: Rules look like the code you\u2019re searching, no static analysis PhD required. They don't require compiled code, only source, reducing iteration time.\n-* **Ease of integration**. Highly portable and many CI and git-hook integrations already exist. Output `--json` and pipe results into your existing systems.\n-* **Polyglot environments**: Don't learn and maintain multiple tools for your polyglot environment (e.g. ESLint, find-sec-bugs, RuboCop, Gosec). Use the same syntax and concepts independent of language.\n-\n-\n-### Language Support\n-\n-| **Python** | **JavaScript** | **Go &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;** | **Java &nbsp;** | **C &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;** | **JSON** | **Ruby** | **OCaml** | **TypeScript** | **PHP &nbsp; &nbsp;** |\n-|:-----------|:---------------|:----------------------------|:----------------|:----------------------------------|:---------|:---------|:----------|:---------------|:----------------------|\n-| \u2705          | \u2705              | \u2705                           | \u2705               | \u2705                            | \u2705       | \ud83d\udea7       |\ud83d\udea7        |  Coming...      | Coming...             |\n-\n-Missing support for a language?

With Semgrep, you could simply supply the pattern `exec(...)` and you'd match:\n-\n-~~~python\n-# Simple cases grep finds\n-exec(\"ls\")\n-exec(some_var)\n-\n-# But you don't have to worry about whitespace\n-exec (foo)\n-\n-# Or calls across multiple lines\n-exec (\n-    bar\n-)\n-~~~\n-\n-Importantly, Semgrep would *not* match the following:\n-\n-~~~python\n-# grep would match this, but Semgrep ignores it because\n-# it doesn't have the right function name\n-other_exec(bar)\n-\n-# Semgrep ignores commented out lines\n-# exec(foo)\n-\n-# and hard-coded strings\n-print(\"exec(bar)\")\n-~~~\n-\n-Semgrep will even match aliased imports:\n-\n-~~~python\n-# Semgrep knows that safe_function refers to exec so it\n-# will still match!\n-#   Oof, try finding this with grep\n-import exec as safe_function\n-safe_function(tricksy)\n-~~~\n-\n-Play with this example in your browser [here](https://semgrep.dev/QrkD), or copy the above code into a file locally (`exec.py`) and run:\n-\n-~~~python\n-$ semgrep -l python -e \"exec(...)\" /path/to/exec.py\n-~~~\n-\n-More example patterns:\n-\n-| **Pattern**                                                        | **Matches**                                                |\n-|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------|\n-| [`$X == $X`](https://semgrep.dev/20B)                             | `if (node.id == node.id): ...`                             |\n-| [`requests.get(..., verify=False, ...)`](https://semgrep.dev/jqn) | `requests.get(url, timeout=3, verify=False)`               |\n-| [`os.system(...)`](https://semgrep.dev/1W5)                       | `from os import system; system('echo semgrep')`            |\n-| [`$ELEMENT.innerHTML`](https://semgrep.dev/9ze)                   | ``el.innerHTML = \"<img src='x' onerror='alert(`XSS`)'>\";`` |\n-| [`$TOKEN.SignedString([]byte(\"...\"))`](https://semgrep.dev/rXW)   | `ss, err := token.SignedString([]byte(\"HARDCODED KEY\"))`   |\n-\n-\u2192 [see more example patterns in the Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/registry).\n-\n-For more info on what you can do in patterns, see the [pattern features\n-docs](docs/pattern-features.md).\n-\n-## Usage\n-\n-Semgrep supports three primary workflows:\n-\n-* Run pre-built rules\n-* Writing custom rules\n-* Run Semgrep continuously in CI\n-\n-The following sections cover each in more detail.\n-\n-### Run Pre-Built Rules\n-\n-The easiest way to get started with Semgrep (other than [semgrep.dev](https://semgrep.dev/)) is to scan your code with pre-built rules.\n-\n-The [Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/r) contains rules for many programming errors, including security issues and correctness bugs. Security rules are annotated with CWE and OWASP metadata when applicable. OWASP rule coverage per language is displayed below.\n-\n-<p align=\"center\">\n-    <img width=\"600\" src=\"https://web-assets.r2c.dev/semgrep-rules-owasp-coverage-20200520.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" />\n-</p>\n-\n-You can use pre-built [Rule Packs](https://semgrep.dev/packs), that contain sets of rules grouped by language and/or framework:\n-\n-```bash\n-$ semgrep --config=https://semgrep.dev/c/p/java\n-$ semgrep --config=https://semgrep.dev/c/p/python\n-$ semgrep --config=https://semgrep.dev/c/p/golang\n-$ semgrep --config=https://semgrep.dev/c/p/javascript\n-...\n-```\n-\n-Or you can run all of Semgrep's default rules for all languages as appropriate (note: each rule says what language it's for, so Semgrep won't try to run a Python rule on Java code).\n-\n-```bash\n-$ semgrep --config=r2c\n-```\n-\n-You can also run a specific rule or group of rules:\n+Once installed, Semgrep can be run with quick patterns or entire rule packs:\n \n-```bash\n-# Run a specific rule\n-$ semgrep --config=https://semgrep.dev/c/r/java.spring.security.audit.cookie-missing-samesite\n+```sh\n+# Check for Python == where the left and right hand sides are the same (often a bug)\n+$ semgrep -e `$X==$X` --lang=py path/to/src\n \n-# Run a set of rules\n-$ semgrep --config=https://semgrep.dev/c/r/java.spring.security\n+# Run the default rule pack with rules for many languages\n+$ semgrep --config=default path/to/src\n ```\n \n-All public Semgrep rules can be viewed on the [Registry](https://semgrep.dev/r), which pulls the rules from YAML files defined in the [semgrep-rules](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep-rules) GitHub repo.\n-\n-Here are some sample vulnerable repos to test on:\n-* Django: [lets-be-bad-guys](https://github.com/mpirnat/lets-be-bad-guys), [django.nV](https://github.com/nVisium/django.nV)\n-* Flask: [Vulnerable-Flask-App](https://github.com/we45/Vulnerable-Flask-App)\n-* Java: [WebGoat](https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat), [OWASP Benchmark](https://github.com/OWASP/Benchmark)\n-* NodeJS: [OWASP Juice Shop](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop), [DevSlop Pixi](https://github.com/DevSlop/Pixi)\n-* Golang: [GoVWA](https://github.com/0c34/govwa)\n-\n-### Writing Custom Rules\n-\n-One of the strengths of Semgrep is how easy it is to write rules.\n-\n-This makes it possible to:\n-* Quickly port rules from other tools.\n-* Think of an interesting code pattern, and then find instances of it in your\n-    code.\n-* Find code base or org-specific bugs and antipatterns - things that built-in\n-    checks for existing tools won't find because they're unique to you.\n-* and more!\n-\n-#### Simple Rules\n-\n-For iterating on simple patterns, you can use the `--lang` and `--pattern`\n-flags.\n-\n-```bash\n-$ semgrep --lang javascript --pattern 'eval(...)' path/to/file.js\n-```\n+Explore community rule packs and CI integrations at [semgrep.dev](https://semgrep.dev/packs).\n \n-The `--lang` flag tells Semgrep which language you're targeting and `--pattern` is the code pattern to search for.\n+## Examples\n \n-#### Advanced Rules\n+### Core Uses\n \n-Some rules need more than one line of pattern to express. Sometimes you want to express code patterns, like: `X` must be true AND `Y` must be too, or `X` but NOT `Y`, or `X` must occur inside a block of code that `Y` matches.\n+- Ban dangerous APIs [[1](https://semgrep.live/clintgibler:no-exec)]\n+- Search routes and authentiation [[1](https://semgrep.live/clintgibler:spring-routes)]\n+- Enforce the use secure defaults [[1](https://semgrep.dev/dlukeomalley:flask-set-cookie)]\n+- Enforce project best-practices [[1](https://semgrep.dev/dlukeomalley:use-assertEqual-for-equality), [2](https://semgrep.dev/dlukeomalley:unchecked-subprocess-call)]\n+- Codify project-specific knowledge [[1](https://semgrep.dev/dlukeomalley:verify-before-make)]\n+- Audit security hotspots [[1](https://semgrep.live/ievans:airflow-xss), [2](https://semgrep.dev/dlukeomalley:hardcoded-credentials)]\n+- Audit configuration files [[1](https://semgrep.dev/dlukeomalley:s3-arn-use)]\n ", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "ee4747391a8b4d3e3ec4959e8ad7ef0c2dcb94e4"}, "originalPosition": 283}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2MzMxOTIyMw==", "bodyText": "Not sure if GitHub placed this ^^^ comment in the right location.

Insecure code is easy to write\n-2. The future of security involves automatically guiding developers towards a \u201cpaved road\u201d made of default-safe frameworks (i.e. [React](https://reactjs.org/) or Object-relational Mappers)\n-3. `grep` isn\u2019t expressive enough and traditional static analysis tools (SAST) are too complicated/slow for paved road automation\n-\n-The AppSec, Developer, and DevOps communities deserve a static analysis tool that is fast, easy to use, code-aware, multi-lingual, and open source!\n-\n-## Overview\n-\n-Semgrep is optimized for:\n-\n-* **Speed**: Fast enough to run on every build, commit, or file save\n-* **Finding bugs that matter**: Run your own specialized rules or choose OWASP 10 checks from the [Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/r). Rules match source code at the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) level, unlike regexes that match strings and aren't semantically aware.\n-* **Ease of customization**: Rules look like the code you\u2019re searching, no static analysis PhD required. They don't require compiled code, only source, reducing iteration time.\n-* **Ease of integration**. Highly portable and many CI and git-hook integrations already exist. Output `--json` and pipe results into your existing systems.\n-* **Polyglot environments**: Don't learn and maintain multiple tools for your polyglot environment (e.g. ESLint, find-sec-bugs, RuboCop, Gosec). Use the same syntax and concepts independent of language.\n-\n-\n-### Language Support\n-\n-| **Python** | **JavaScript** | **Go &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;** | **Java &nbsp;** | **C &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;** | **JSON** | **Ruby** | **OCaml** | **TypeScript** | **PHP &nbsp; &nbsp;** |\n-|:-----------|:---------------|:----------------------------|:----------------|:----------------------------------|:---------|:---------|:----------|:---------------|:----------------------|\n-| \u2705          | \u2705              | \u2705                           | \u2705               | \u2705                            | \u2705       | \ud83d\udea7       |\ud83d\udea7        |  Coming...      | Coming...             |\n-\n-Missing support for a language?

With Semgrep, you could simply supply the pattern `exec(...)` and you'd match:\n-\n-~~~python\n-# Simple cases grep finds\n-exec(\"ls\")\n-exec(some_var)\n-\n-# But you don't have to worry about whitespace\n-exec (foo)\n-\n-# Or calls across multiple lines\n-exec (\n-    bar\n-)\n-~~~\n-\n-Importantly, Semgrep would *not* match the following:\n-\n-~~~python\n-# grep would match this, but Semgrep ignores it because\n-# it doesn't have the right function name\n-other_exec(bar)\n-\n-# Semgrep ignores commented out lines\n-# exec(foo)\n-\n-# and hard-coded strings\n-print(\"exec(bar)\")\n-~~~\n-\n-Semgrep will even match aliased imports:\n-\n-~~~python\n-# Semgrep knows that safe_function refers to exec so it\n-# will still match!\n-#   Oof, try finding this with grep\n-import exec as safe_function\n-safe_function(tricksy)\n-~~~\n-\n-Play with this example in your browser [here](https://semgrep.dev/QrkD), or copy the above code into a file locally (`exec.py`) and run:\n-\n-~~~python\n-$ semgrep -l python -e \"exec(...)\" /path/to/exec.py\n-~~~\n-\n-More example patterns:\n-\n-| **Pattern**                                                        | **Matches**                                                |\n-|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------|\n-| [`$X == $X`](https://semgrep.dev/20B)                             | `if (node.id == node.id): ...`                             |\n-| [`requests.get(..., verify=False, ...)`](https://semgrep.dev/jqn) | `requests.get(url, timeout=3, verify=False)`               |\n-| [`os.system(...)`](https://semgrep.dev/1W5)                       | `from os import system; system('echo semgrep')`            |\n-| [`$ELEMENT.innerHTML`](https://semgrep.dev/9ze)                   | ``el.innerHTML = \"<img src='x' onerror='alert(`XSS`)'>\";`` |\n-| [`$TOKEN.SignedString([]byte(\"...\"))`](https://semgrep.dev/rXW)   | `ss, err := token.SignedString([]byte(\"HARDCODED KEY\"))`   |\n-\n-\u2192 [see more example patterns in the Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/registry).\n-\n-For more info on what you can do in patterns, see the [pattern features\n-docs](docs/pattern-features.md).\n-\n-## Usage\n-\n-Semgrep supports three primary workflows:\n-\n-* Run pre-built rules\n-* Writing custom rules\n-* Run Semgrep continuously in CI\n-\n-The following sections cover each in more detail.\n-\n-### Run Pre-Built Rules\n-\n-The easiest way to get started with Semgrep (other than [semgrep.dev](https://semgrep.dev/)) is to scan your code with pre-built rules.\n-\n-The [Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/r) contains rules for many programming errors, including security issues and correctness bugs. Security rules are annotated with CWE and OWASP metadata when applicable. OWASP rule coverage per language is displayed below.\n-\n-<p align=\"center\">\n-    <img width=\"600\" src=\"https://web-assets.r2c.dev/semgrep-rules-owasp-coverage-20200520.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" />\n-</p>\n-\n-You can use pre-built [Rule Packs](https://semgrep.dev/packs), that contain sets of rules grouped by language and/or framework:\n-\n-```bash\n-$ semgrep --config=https://semgrep.dev/c/p/java\n-$ semgrep --config=https://semgrep.dev/c/p/python\n-$ semgrep --config=https://semgrep.dev/c/p/golang\n-$ semgrep --config=https://semgrep.dev/c/p/javascript\n-...\n-```\n-\n-Or you can run all of Semgrep's default rules for all languages as appropriate (note: each rule says what language it's for, so Semgrep won't try to run a Python rule on Java code).\n-\n-```bash\n-$ semgrep --config=r2c\n-```\n-\n-You can also run a specific rule or group of rules:\n+Once installed, Semgrep can be run with quick patterns or entire rule packs:\n \n-```bash\n-# Run a specific rule\n-$ semgrep --config=https://semgrep.dev/c/r/java.spring.security.audit.cookie-missing-samesite\n+```sh\n+# Check for Python == where the left and right hand sides are the same (often a bug)\n+$ semgrep -e `$X==$X` --lang=py path/to/src\n \n-# Run a set of rules\n-$ semgrep --config=https://semgrep.dev/c/r/java.spring.security\n+# Run the default rule pack with rules for many languages\n+$ semgrep --config=default path/to/src\n ```\n \n-All public Semgrep rules can be viewed on the [Registry](https://semgrep.dev/r), which pulls the rules from YAML files defined in the [semgrep-rules](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep-rules) GitHub repo.\n-\n-Here are some sample vulnerable repos to test on:\n-* Django: [lets-be-bad-guys](https://github.com/mpirnat/lets-be-bad-guys), [django.nV](https://github.com/nVisium/django.nV)\n-* Flask: [Vulnerable-Flask-App](https://github.com/we45/Vulnerable-Flask-App)\n-* Java: [WebGoat](https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat), [OWASP Benchmark](https://github.com/OWASP/Benchmark)\n-* NodeJS: [OWASP Juice Shop](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop), [DevSlop Pixi](https://github.com/DevSlop/Pixi)\n-* Golang: [GoVWA](https://github.com/0c34/govwa)\n-\n-### Writing Custom Rules\n-\n-One of the strengths of Semgrep is how easy it is to write rules.\n-\n-This makes it possible to:\n-* Quickly port rules from other tools.\n-* Think of an interesting code pattern, and then find instances of it in your\n-    code.\n-* Find code base or org-specific bugs and antipatterns - things that built-in\n-    checks for existing tools won't find because they're unique to you.\n-* and more!\n-\n-#### Simple Rules\n-\n-For iterating on simple patterns, you can use the `--lang` and `--pattern`\n-flags.\n-\n-```bash\n-$ semgrep --lang javascript --pattern 'eval(...)' path/to/file.js\n-```\n+Explore community rule packs and CI integrations at [semgrep.dev](https://semgrep.dev/packs).\n \n-The `--lang` flag tells Semgrep which language you're targeting and `--pattern` is the code pattern to search for.\n+## Examples\n \n-#### Advanced Rules\n+### Core Uses\n \n-Some rules need more than one line of pattern to express. Sometimes you want to express code patterns, like: `X` must be true AND `Y` must be too, or `X` but NOT `Y`, or `X` must occur inside a block of code that `Y` matches.\n+- Ban dangerous APIs [[1](https://semgrep.live/clintgibler:no-exec)]\n+- Search routes and authentiation [[1](https://semgrep.live/clintgibler:spring-routes)]\n+- Enforce the use secure defaults [[1](https://semgrep.dev/dlukeomalley:flask-set-cookie)]\n+- Enforce project best-practices [[1](https://semgrep.dev/dlukeomalley:use-assertEqual-for-equality), [2](https://semgrep.dev/dlukeomalley:unchecked-subprocess-call)]\n+- Codify project-specific knowledge [[1](https://semgrep.dev/dlukeomalley:verify-before-make)]\n+- Audit security hotspots [[1](https://semgrep.live/ievans:airflow-xss), [2](https://semgrep.dev/dlukeomalley:hardcoded-credentials)]\n+- Audit configuration files [[1](https://semgrep.dev/dlukeomalley:s3-arn-use)]\n \n-For these cases, Semgrep has a more powerful and flexible [YAML syntax](docs/configuration-files.md).\n+### Upgrading Code\n \n-You can run a single rule or directory of rules specified in YAML by:\n-```bash\n-$ semgrep --config my_rule.yml path/to/dir_or_file\n+- Migrate from deprecated APIs [[1](https://semgrep.dev/editor?registry=java.lang.security.audit.crypto.des-is-deprecated), [2](https://semgrep.dev/editor?registry=python.bokeh.maintainability.deprecated.deprecated_apis), [3](https://semgrep.dev/editor?registry=python.flask.maintainability.deprecated.deprecated-apis)]\n+- Apply automatic fixes [[1](https://semgrep.live/clintgibler:use-listenAndServeTLS), [2]()]\n \n-$ semgrep --config yaml_dir/ path/to/dir_or_file\n-```\n-\n-**Example Advanced Rule**\n-\n-Say you are building a financial trading application in which every `Transaction` object must first be passed to `verify_transaction()` before being passed to `make_transaction()`, or it's a business logic bug.\n-\n-You can express this behavior with the following Semgrep YAML pattern:\n-\n-```yaml\n-rules:\n-- id: find-unverified-transactions\n-  patterns:\n-    - pattern: |\n-        public $RETURN $METHOD(...){\n-            ...\n-            make_transaction($T);\n-            ...\n-        }\n-    - pattern-not: |\n-        public $RETURN $METHOD(...){\n-            ...\n-            verify_transaction($T);\n-            ...\n-            make_transaction($T);\n-            ...\n-        }\n-  message: |\n-    In $METHOD, there's a call to make_transaction() without first calling verify_transaction() on the Transaction object.\n-```\n-\n-* `$RETURN`, `$METHOD`, and `$T` are *metavariables*, an abstraction that Semgrep provides when you want to match something but you don't know exactly what it is ahead of time.\n-  * You can think of *metavariables* like a [capture group](https://regexone.com/lesson/capturing_groups) in regular expressions.\n-* The `pattern` clause defines what we're looking for: any method that calls `make_transaction()`.\n-* The `pattern-not` clause *filters out* matches we don't want; in this case, methods where a transaction (`$T`) is passed to `verify_transaction()` before `make_transaction()`.\n-* The `message` is what's returned in Semgrep output, either to STDOUT or as a comment on the pull request on GitHub or other systems.\n-  * Note that *metavariables* can be used to customize messages and make them\n-    contextually relevant. Here we're helpfully telling the user the method\n-    where we've identified the bug.\n-\n-You can play with this transaction example here: https://semgrep.dev/4b4g.\n-\n-**Learn More**\n-\n-* See the [pattern features docs](docs/pattern-features.md) for more info and\n-  examples on the flexibility and power of Semgrep patterns.\n-* See the [YAML configuration file docs](docs/configuration-files.md) for\n-  details on all of the keys that can be used and how they work.\n-* See [Semgrep rule writing methodology](docs/writing_rules/README.md) for\n-  details on the thought process behind writing and rolling out a new Semgrep\n-  rule successfully, and see [these docs](docs/writing_rules/examples.md) for\n-  walkthroughs of writing rules from scratch.\n-* There's also an interactive, example-based Semgrep rule writing tutorial here:\n-  https://semgrep.dev/learn.\n-\n-### Run Semgrep Continuously in CI\n-\n-Semgrep can be run via CLI or Docker and output results as JSON (via the `--json` flag), so it can be inserted into any CI pipeline and have its results processed by whatever tools you're using.\n-\n-Semgrep is aware of *diffs*, so it can report only findings that occur in newly added code, for example, in a commit or pull request.\n-\n-Currently, the easiest way to integrate Semgrep into CI is via a GitHub action we've built. See the [integrations docs](docs/integrations.md) for more details.\n-\n-Semgrep can also output results in the standardized Static Analysis Results Interchange Format ([SARIF](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/cs01/sarif-v2.1.0-cs01.html)) with the `--sarif` flag, if you use tools that accept this format.\n-\n-## Upgrading\n+## Resources\n \n-How you upgrade Semgrep will depend on how you installed it.\n+Learn more:\n \n-From Homebrew:\n+- [Live editor](https://semgrep.dev/editor)\n+- [Community rule registry](https://semgrep.dev/r)", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "ee4747391a8b4d3e3ec4959e8ad7ef0c2dcb94e4"}, "originalPosition": 366}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMjg5NDcyNzg4OnYy", "diffSide": "LEFT", "path": "README.md", "isResolved": true, "comments": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNy0zMVQxMzo0MzoyOVrOG6JC9w==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wOC0wNVQxNDoyNDowOVrOG8MELA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2MzYxODgwNw==", "bodyText": "We need to keep the Upgrading header - it's referenced by the upgrade CLI message:\n\n\"A new version of Semgrep is available.

Insecure code is easy to write\n-2. The future of security involves automatically guiding developers towards a \u201cpaved road\u201d made of default-safe frameworks (i.e. [React](https://reactjs.org/) or Object-relational Mappers)\n-3. `grep` isn\u2019t expressive enough and traditional static analysis tools (SAST) are too complicated/slow for paved road automation\n-\n-The AppSec, Developer, and DevOps communities deserve a static analysis tool that is fast, easy to use, code-aware, multi-lingual, and open source!\n-\n-## Overview\n-\n-Semgrep is optimized for:\n-\n-* **Speed**: Fast enough to run on every build, commit, or file save\n-* **Finding bugs that matter**: Run your own specialized rules or choose OWASP 10 checks from the [Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/r). Rules match source code at the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) level, unlike regexes that match strings and aren't semantically aware.\n-* **Ease of customization**: Rules look like the code you\u2019re searching, no static analysis PhD required. They don't require compiled code, only source, reducing iteration time.\n-* **Ease of integration**. Highly portable and many CI and git-hook integrations already exist. Output `--json` and pipe results into your existing systems.\n-* **Polyglot environments**: Don't learn and maintain multiple tools for your polyglot environment (e.g. ESLint, find-sec-bugs, RuboCop, Gosec). Use the same syntax and concepts independent of language.\n-\n-\n-### Language Support\n-\n-| **Python** | **JavaScript** | **Go &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;** | **Java &nbsp;** | **C &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;** | **JSON** | **Ruby** | **OCaml** | **TypeScript** | **PHP &nbsp; &nbsp;** |\n-|:-----------|:---------------|:----------------------------|:----------------|:----------------------------------|:---------|:---------|:----------|:---------------|:----------------------|\n-| \u2705          | \u2705              | \u2705                           | \u2705               | \u2705                            | \u2705       | \ud83d\udea7       |\ud83d\udea7        |  Coming...      | Coming...             |\n-\n-Missing support for a language?

OWASP rule coverage per language is displayed below.\n-\n-<p align=\"center\">\n-    <img width=\"600\" src=\"https://web-assets.r2c.dev/semgrep-rules-owasp-coverage-20200520.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" />\n-</p>\n-\n-You can use pre-built [Rule Packs](https://semgrep.dev/packs), that contain sets of rules grouped by language and/or framework:\n-\n-```bash\n-$ semgrep --config=https://semgrep.dev/c/p/java\n-$ semgrep --config=https://semgrep.dev/c/p/python\n-$ semgrep --config=https://semgrep.dev/c/p/golang\n-$ semgrep --config=https://semgrep.dev/c/p/javascript\n-...\n-```\n-\n-Or you can run all of Semgrep's default rules for all languages as appropriate (note: each rule says what language it's for, so Semgrep won't try to run a Python rule on Java code).\n-\n-```bash\n-$ semgrep --config=r2c\n-```\n-\n-You can also run a specific rule or group of rules:\n+Once installed, Semgrep can be run with single patterns or entire rule packs:\n \n-```bash\n-# Run a specific rule\n-$ semgrep --config=https://semgrep.dev/c/r/java.spring.security.audit.cookie-missing-samesite\n+```sh\n+# Check for Python == where the left and right hand sides are the same (often a bug)\n+$ semgrep -e `$X==$X` --lang=py path/to/src\n \n-# Run a set of rules\n-$ semgrep --config=https://semgrep.dev/c/r/java.spring.security\n+# Run the default rule pack with rules for many languages\n+$ semgrep --config=default path/to/src\n ```\n \n-All public Semgrep rules can be viewed on the [Registry](https://semgrep.dev/r), which pulls the rules from YAML files defined in the [semgrep-rules](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep-rules) GitHub repo.\n-\n-Here are some sample vulnerable repos to test on:\n-* Django: [lets-be-bad-guys](https://github.com/mpirnat/lets-be-bad-guys), [django.nV](https://github.com/nVisium/django.nV)\n-* Flask: [Vulnerable-Flask-App](https://github.com/we45/Vulnerable-Flask-App)\n-* Java: [WebGoat](https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat), [OWASP Benchmark](https://github.com/OWASP/Benchmark)\n-* NodeJS: [OWASP Juice Shop](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop), [DevSlop Pixi](https://github.com/DevSlop/Pixi)\n-* Golang: [GoVWA](https://github.com/0c34/govwa)\n-\n-### Writing Custom Rules\n-\n-One of the strengths of Semgrep is how easy it is to write rules.\n-\n-This makes it possible to:\n-* Quickly port rules from other tools.\n-* Think of an interesting code pattern, and then find instances of it in your\n-    code.\n-* Find code base or org-specific bugs and antipatterns - things that built-in\n-    checks for existing tools won't find because they're unique to you.\n-* and more!\n-\n-#### Simple Rules\n-\n-For iterating on simple patterns, you can use the `--lang` and `--pattern`\n-flags.\n-\n-```bash\n-$ semgrep --lang javascript --pattern 'eval(...)' path/to/file.js\n-```\n+Explore the Semgrep Registry of rules and CI integrations at [semgrep.dev](https://semgrep.dev/packs).\n \n-The `--lang` flag tells Semgrep which language you're targeting and `--pattern` is the code pattern to search for.\n+## Examples\n \n-#### Advanced Rules\n+### Core Uses\n \n-Some rules need more than one line of pattern to express. Sometimes you want to express code patterns, like: `X` must be true AND `Y` must be too, or `X` but NOT `Y`, or `X` must occur inside a block of code that `Y` matches.\n+- Ban dangerous APIs [[1](https://semgrep.live/clintgibler:no-exec)]\n+- Search routes and authentiation [[1](https://semgrep.live/clintgibler:spring-routes)]\n+- Enforce the use secure defaults [[1](https://semgrep.dev/dlukeomalley:flask-set-cookie)]\n+- Enforce project best-practices [[1](https://semgrep.dev/dlukeomalley:use-assertEqual-for-equality), [2](https://semgrep.dev/dlukeomalley:unchecked-subprocess-call)]\n+- Codify project-specific knowledge [[1](https://semgrep.dev/dlukeomalley:verify-before-make)]\n+- Audit security hotspots [[1](https://semgrep.live/ievans:airflow-xss), [2](https://semgrep.dev/dlukeomalley:hardcoded-credentials)]\n+- Audit configuration files [[1](https://semgrep.dev/dlukeomalley:s3-arn-use)]\n \n-For these cases, Semgrep has a more powerful and flexible [YAML syntax](docs/configuration-files.md).\n+### Upgrading Code\n \n-You can run a single rule or directory of rules specified in YAML by:\n-```bash\n-$ semgrep --config my_rule.yml path/to/dir_or_file\n+- Migrate from deprecated APIs [[1](https://semgrep.dev/editor?registry=java.lang.security.audit.crypto.des-is-deprecated), [2](https://semgrep.dev/editor?registry=python.bokeh.maintainability.deprecated.deprecated_apis), [3](https://semgrep.dev/editor?registry=python.flask.maintainability.deprecated.deprecated-apis)]\n+- Apply automatic fixes [[1](https://semgrep.live/clintgibler:use-listenAndServeTLS), [2]()]\n \n-$ semgrep --config yaml_dir/ path/to/dir_or_file\n-```\n-\n-**Example Advanced Rule**\n-\n-Say you are building a financial trading application in which every `Transaction` object must first be passed to `verify_transaction()` before being passed to `make_transaction()`, or it's a business logic bug.\n-\n-You can express this behavior with the following Semgrep YAML pattern:\n-\n-```yaml\n-rules:\n-- id: find-unverified-transactions\n-  patterns:\n-    - pattern: |\n-        public $RETURN $METHOD(...){\n-            ...\n-            make_transaction($T);\n-            ...\n-        }\n-    - pattern-not: |\n-        public $RETURN $METHOD(...){\n-            ...\n-            verify_transaction($T);\n-            ...\n-            make_transaction($T);\n-            ...\n-        }\n-  message: |\n-    In $METHOD, there's a call to make_transaction() without first calling verify_transaction() on the Transaction object.\n-```\n-\n-* `$RETURN`, `$METHOD`, and `$T` are *metavariables*, an abstraction that Semgrep provides when you want to match something but you don't know exactly what it is ahead of time.\n-  * You can think of *metavariables* like a [capture group](https://regexone.com/lesson/capturing_groups) in regular expressions.\n-* The `pattern` clause defines what we're looking for: any method that calls `make_transaction()`.\n-* The `pattern-not` clause *filters out* matches we don't want; in this case, methods where a transaction (`$T`) is passed to `verify_transaction()` before `make_transaction()`.\n-* The `message` is what's returned in Semgrep output, either to STDOUT or as a comment on the pull request on GitHub or other systems.\n-  * Note that *metavariables* can be used to customize messages and make them\n-    contextually relevant. Here we're helpfully telling the user the method\n-    where we've identified the bug.\n-\n-You can play with this transaction example here: https://semgrep.dev/4b4g.\n-\n-**Learn More**\n-\n-* See the [pattern features docs](docs/pattern-features.md) for more info and\n-  examples on the flexibility and power of Semgrep patterns.\n-* See the [YAML configuration file docs](docs/configuration-files.md) for\n-  details on all of the keys that can be used and how they work.\n-* See [Semgrep rule writing methodology](docs/writing_rules/README.md) for\n-  details on the thought process behind writing and rolling out a new Semgrep\n-  rule successfully, and see [these docs](docs/writing_rules/examples.md) for\n-  walkthroughs of writing rules from scratch.\n-* There's also an interactive, example-based Semgrep rule writing tutorial here:\n-  https://semgrep.dev/learn.\n-\n-### Run Semgrep Continuously in CI\n-\n-Semgrep can be run via CLI or Docker and output results as JSON (via the `--json` flag), so it can be inserted into any CI pipeline and have its results processed by whatever tools you're using.\n-\n-Semgrep is aware of *diffs*, so it can report only findings that occur in newly added code, for example, in a commit or pull request.\n-\n-Currently, the easiest way to integrate Semgrep into CI is via a GitHub action we've built. See the [integrations docs](docs/integrations.md) for more details.\n-\n-Semgrep can also output results in the standardized Static Analysis Results Interchange Format ([SARIF](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/cs01/sarif-v2.1.0-cs01.html)) with the `--sarif` flag, if you use tools that accept this format.\n-\n-## Upgrading", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2MzYxODgwNw=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "51ab6ac78f1cda687e85c3d5f52234b7a0ba823b"}, "originalPosition": 358}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMjkxNDM2MDY3OnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "README.md", "isResolved": true, "comments": {"totalCount": 4, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wOC0wNlQxODowMDoyMVrOG8-cCQ==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wOC0wN1QwNTo0NzoxOFrOG9NRbA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2NjU5MDcyOQ==", "bodyText": "Since we don't really support C and don't have immediate plans to, would it make sense to moving this to last?

Insecure code is easy to write\n-2. The future of security involves automatically guiding developers towards a \u201cpaved road\u201d made of default-safe frameworks (i.e. [React](https://reactjs.org/) or Object-relational Mappers)\n-3. `grep` isn\u2019t expressive enough and traditional static analysis tools (SAST) are too complicated/slow for paved road automation\n-\n-The AppSec, Developer, and DevOps communities deserve a static analysis tool that is fast, easy to use, code-aware, multi-lingual, and open source!\n-\n-## Overview\n-\n-Semgrep is optimized for:\n-\n-* **Speed**: Fast enough to run on every build, commit, or file save\n-* **Finding bugs that matter**: Run your own specialized rules or choose OWASP 10 checks from the [Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/r). Rules match source code at the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) level, unlike regexes that match strings and aren't semantically aware.\n-* **Ease of customization**: Rules look like the code you\u2019re searching, no static analysis PhD required. They don't require compiled code, only source, reducing iteration time.\n-* **Ease of integration**. Highly portable and many CI and git-hook integrations already exist. Output `--json` and pipe results into your existing systems.\n-* **Polyglot environments**: Don't learn and maintain multiple tools for your polyglot environment (e.g. ESLint, find-sec-bugs, RuboCop, Gosec). Use the same syntax and concepts independent of language.\n-\n-\n-### Language Support\n-\n-| **Python** | **JavaScript** | **Go &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;** | **Java &nbsp;** | **C &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;** | **JSON** | **Ruby** | **OCaml** | **TypeScript** | **PHP &nbsp; &nbsp;** |\n-|:-----------|:---------------|:----------------------------|:----------------|:----------------------------------|:---------|:---------|:----------|:---------------|:----------------------|\n-| \u2705          | \u2705              | \u2705                           | \u2705               | \u2705                            | \u2705       | \ud83d\udea7       |\ud83d\udea7        |  Coming...      | Coming...             |\n-\n-Missing support for a language?

financial trading application in which every `Transaction` object must first be passed to `verify_transaction()` before being passed to `make_transaction()`, or it's a business logic bug.\n-\n-You can express this behavior with the following Semgrep YAML pattern:\n-\n-```yaml\n-rules:\n-- id: find-unverified-transactions\n-  patterns:\n-    - pattern: |\n-        public $RETURN $METHOD(...){\n-            ...\n-            make_transaction($T);\n-            ...\n-        }\n-    - pattern-not: |\n-        public $RETURN $METHOD(...){\n-            ...\n-            verify_transaction($T);\n-            ...\n-            make_transaction($T);\n-            ...\n-        }\n-  message: |\n-    In $METHOD, there's a call to make_transaction() without first calling verify_transaction() on the Transaction object.\n-```\n+## Resources\n \n-* `$RETURN`, `$METHOD`, and `$T` are *metavariables*, an abstraction that Semgrep provides when you want to match something but you don't know exactly what it is ahead of time.\n-  * You can think of *metavariables* like a [capture group](https://regexone.com/lesson/capturing_groups) in regular expressions.\n-* The `pattern` clause defines what we're looking for: any method that calls `make_transaction()`.\n-* The `pattern-not` clause *filters out* matches we don't want; in this case, methods where a transaction (`$T`) is passed to `verify_transaction()` before `make_transaction()`.\n-* The `message` is what's returned in Semgrep output, either to STDOUT or as a comment on the pull request on GitHub or other systems.\n-  * Note that *metavariables* can be used to customize messages and make them\n-    contextually relevant. Here we're helpfully telling the user the method\n-    where we've identified the bug.\n+Learn more:\n \n-You can play with this transaction example here: https://semgrep.dev/4b4g.\n+- [Live editor](https://semgrep.dev/editor)\n+- [Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.dev/r)\n+- [Documentation](docs/README.md)\n+- [r2c YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5ahcFBorwzUTqPipFhjkWg) for more videos.\n \n-**Learn More**\n+Get in touch:\n \n-* See the [pattern features docs](docs/pattern-features.md) for more info and\n-  examples on the flexibility and power of Semgrep patterns.\n-* See the [YAML configuration file docs](docs/configuration-files.md) for\n-  details on all of the keys that can be used and how they work.\n-* See [Semgrep rule writing methodology](docs/writing_rules/README.md) for\n-  details on the thought process behind writing and rolling out a new Semgrep\n-  rule successfully, and see [these docs](docs/writing_rules/examples.md) for\n-  walkthroughs of writing rules from scratch.\n-* There's also an interactive, example-based Semgrep rule writing tutorial here:\n-  https://semgrep.dev/learn.\n+- Submit a [bug report](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/issues)\n+- Join the [Semgrep Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/r2c-community/shared_invite/enQtNjU0NDYzMjAwODY4LWE3NTg1MGNhYTAwMzk5ZGRhMjQ2MzVhNGJiZjI1ZWQ0NjQ2YWI4ZGY3OGViMGJjNzA4ODQ3MjEzOWExNjZlNTA) to say \"hi\" or ask questions\n \n-### Run Semgrep Continuously in CI\n+## Usage\n \n-Semgrep can be run via CLI or Docker and output results as JSON (via the `--json` flag), so it can be inserted into any CI pipeline and have its results processed by whatever tools you're using.\n+### Command Line Options\n \n-Semgrep is aware of *diffs*, so it can report only findings that occur in newly added code, for example, in a commit or pull request.\n+See `semgrep --help` for command line options.\n \n-Currently, the easiest way to integrate Semgrep into CI is via a GitHub action we've built.
