In addition to reproducibility, we want to stay current with the ocaml packages and reduce the amount of maintenance. How about we use the latest image but we print the image ID at runtime (docker build) for troubleshooting purposes?\nOn DockerHub, we could set a tag based on the date e.g. returntocorp/ocaml:alpine-2020-09-11 in addition to returntocorp/ocaml:alpine. I would still reference returntocorp/ocaml:alpine in CI builds but a message would indicate that returntocorp/ocaml:alpine-2020-09-11 is available for troubleshooting purposes.\nI'll take care of tagging with dates.
