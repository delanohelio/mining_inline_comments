Every `MutableList` also implements `java.util.List`, so you can pass any `MutableList` to APIs that still use the standard Java collections.\n+\n+`ImmutableList` does not extend `java.util.List` and - as its name suggests - does not offer any methods for mutation such as `add` or `remove`. Instead you can create copies of these collections with elements added or removed. If you wish to use these collections with traditional `java.util.List` APIs you can use the `castToList()` method on `ImmutableList`, which will return an instance of `java.util.List` that will throw exceptions on mutation operations like `remove`.\n+\n+`IntList` is a special type of list that offers lightweight APIs for working with primitives. Similar collection types exist for all other primitives. The problem with \"normal\" collections and primitives is that using a `List<Integer>` or similar type will always carry additional overhead both in terms of more memory use and more CPU time due to indirection and additional garbage collection load. Because of this, for performance-critical operations, a dedicated `IntList` type is superior.\n+\n+Eclipse Collections is hardly the first library to provide primitive collections but combined with its handy API it makes for arguably the best library of its kind. Using Eclipse primitive collections you can have the performance of primitive arrays with the ease-of-use of the Eclipse Collections API.\n+\n+For all the primitive collection types there also exist mutable and immutable versions (`MutableIntList`, `ImmutableIntList`). They behave much the same as their object-based counterparts so we will not cover them here.\n+\n+Eclipse Collections is split into two parts: The API and the implementation of that API. Since the implementation depends on the API, we will only have to add that as a dependency to our Maven project:\n+\n+```xml\n+<dependency>\n+    <groupId>org.eclipse.collections</groupId>\n+    <artifactId>eclipse-collections</artifactId>\n+    <version>9.2.0</version>\n+</dependency>\n+```\n+\n+Or with Gradle:\n+\n+```\n+compile 'org.eclipse.collections:eclipse-collections:9.2.0'\n+```\n+\n+9.2.0 is the current Eclipse Collections version at time of writing. Check out [the maven repo](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:org.eclipse.collections%20AND%20a:eclipse-collections&core=gav) for newer versions.\n+\n+## Jackson\n+\n+Jackson is a library for transforming your data structures from and to JSON and other serialized forms. According to [mvnrepository.com](https://mvnrepository.com/popular) it is the most popular framework for this purpose.\n+\n+Jackson's architecture consists of three parts: A *core* that is responsible for writing streams of data (typically JSON), *databind* which is responsible for the basic object serialization API, and various Jackson modules that each handle serialization of some special types. Adding Jackson to our project is simple:\n+\n+```xml\n+<dependency>\n+  <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>\n+  <artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>\n+  <version>2.9.8</version>\n+</dependency>\n+<dependency>\n+  <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype</groupId>\n+  <artifactId>jackson-datatype-eclipse-collections</artifactId>\n+  <version>2.9.8</version>\n+</dependency>\n+```\n+\n+Or with Gradle:\n+\n+```\n+compile 'com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:2.9.8'\n+compile 'com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype:jackson-datatype-eclipse-collections:2.9.8'\n+```", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "8a9e4b122eb195a5b763ea02101d373d77c7c08f"}, "originalPosition": 77}]}}, {"__typename": "HeadRefForcePushedEvent", "beforeCommit": {"oid": "8a9e4b122eb195a5b763ea02101d373d77c7c08f", "author": {"user": {"login": "yawkat", "name": "Jonas Konrad"}}, "url": "https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections/commit/8a9e4b122eb195a5b763ea02101d373d77c7c08f", "committedDate": "2020-09-09T21:16:03Z", "message": "Documentation on serializing EC with jackson"}, "afterCommit": {"oid": "87c3bc7cada768ef493292db03674414538e9b2f", "author": {"user": {"login": "yawkat", "name": "Jonas Konrad"}}, "url": "https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections/commit/87c3bc7cada768ef493292db03674414538e9b2f", "committedDate": "2020-09-11T09:21:08Z", "message": "Documentation on serializing EC with jackson\n\nSigned-off-by: Jonas Konrad <me@yawk.at>"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDg3MjY2MTAx", "url": "https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections/pull/997#pullrequestreview-487266101", "createdAt": "2020-09-13T01:02:14Z", "commit": {"oid": "87c3bc7cada768ef493292db03674414538e9b2f"}, "state": "APPROVED", "comments": {"totalCount": 0, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": null, "endCursor": null, "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": []}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "068a94f18eeca6c83dc47caa27c94bf331ea38b1", "author": {"user": {"login": "yawkat", "name": "Jonas Konrad"}}, "url": "https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections/commit/068a94f18eeca6c83dc47caa27c94bf331ea38b1", "committedDate": "2020-09-13T16:19:27Z", "message": "Documentation on serializing EC with jackson\n\nSigned-off-by: Jonas Konrad <me@yawk.at>"}}, {"__typename": "HeadRefForcePushedEvent", "beforeCommit": {"oid": "87c3bc7cada768ef493292db03674414538e9b2f", "author": {"user": {"login": "yawkat", "name": "Jonas Konrad"}}, "url": "https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections/commit/87c3bc7cada768ef493292db03674414538e9b2f", "committedDate": "2020-09-11T09:21:08Z", "message": "Documentation on serializing EC with jackson\n\nSigned-off-by: Jonas Konrad <me@yawk.at>"}, "afterCommit": {"oid": "068a94f18eeca6c83dc47caa27c94bf331ea38b1", "author": {"user": {"login": "yawkat", "name": "Jonas Konrad"}}, "url": "https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections/commit/068a94f18eeca6c83dc47caa27c94bf331ea38b1", "committedDate": "2020-09-13T16:19:27Z", "message": "Documentation on serializing EC with jackson\n\nSigned-off-by: Jonas Konrad <me@yawk.at>"}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 730, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-01T13:51:04Z"}}}
