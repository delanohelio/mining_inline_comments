It is only a guess.\nThe user has to choice to think if they really want to import that stuff or not. No further information, how many entries are duplicates, which ones are duplicates, ... The dialog as is is not that helpful.\nIn other words: JabRef does not do any auto merge at all. It is also not a re-import, because the duplicates might not be \"real\" duplicates (letter-by-letter).\nThe decision the user has to take is: \"Continue processing and all entries indepdenent of them being new ones or duplicates\" or \"Cancel import and leave the database as is\"\nThese texts are too long for a button.
