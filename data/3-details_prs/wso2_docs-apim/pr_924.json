If the authorization server issues a refresh token, it is included when returning an access token.\u00a0Refresh tokens are issued for all other grant types other than the **implicit grant** as recommended by the OAuth 2.0 specification.\n+After an access token is generated, sometimes you might have to renew the old token due to expiration or security concerns. You can renew an access token using a refresh token, by issuing a REST call to the Token API with the following parameters.\n+A refresh token has to be obtained before using it with a grant type such as the authorization code or password grant type.
