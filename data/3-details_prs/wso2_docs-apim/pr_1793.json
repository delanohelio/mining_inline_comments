If there is any failure in the deployment, it will again be triggered for n times where n is the maximum retry count. If the APIs are not deployed even in n retries then the server will start with un deployed API artifacts. If the user wants to switch the startup mode to an Asynchronous mode then he needs to specify it in the configs as `data_retrieval_mode = \"async\"`.
