To create a custom user who can import APIs, refer [Steps to Create a Custom User who can Perform API Controller Operations]({{base_path}}/learn/api-controller/advanced-topics/creating-custom-users-to-perform-api-controller-operations/#steps-to-create-a-custom-user-who-can-perform-api-controller-operations).\n \n+    !!! example\n+        ```bash\n+        $ apictl vcs deploy -e prod\n+        Deploying Projects (1)...\n+\n+        APIs (1) ...\n+        1: SwaggerPetstore-1.0.0: (SwaggerPetstore-1.0.0)\n+        Successfully imported API\n+        ```\n+\n+    Now the tool will automatically detect the target environment and prepare a new artifact containing environment-related details. \n+\n+    If you run `vcs deploy` command again, you will see the below output indicating that the deployment is already up-to-date.\n+\n+    !!! example\n+        ```bash\n+        $ apictl vcs deploy -e prod\n+        Everything is up-to-date\n+        ```\n+\n+    !!! tip\n+        If you have multiple APIs to promote through CI/CD, you can commit those API projects as well to same repository. The rest of the process will be the same as above.\n+ \n+        If you have export (or initialized) and committed another API **Pizzashack-1.0.0** to the same repository and then run `vcs status` and `vcs deploy` commands, you will be able to see the below outputs. \n+\n+        ```bash\n+        $ apictl vcs status -e prod\n+        Projects to Deploy (1)\n+\n+        APIs (1) ...\n+        1: [save]\t\tPizzashack-1.0.0: (Pizzashack-1.0.0)\n+\n+        $ apictl vcs deploy -e prod\n+        Deploying Projects (1)...\n+\n+        APIs (1) ...\n+        1: Pizzashack-1.0.0: (Pizzashack-1.0.0)\n+        Successfully imported API\n+        ```\n+\n+        Here, **apictl** detects that there's a new API project is available to deploy.
