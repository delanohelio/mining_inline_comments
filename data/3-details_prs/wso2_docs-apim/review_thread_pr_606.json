In this example, you will be using the default keystore in your WSO2 product ( `wso2carbon.jks` ). You can read about the recommendations for using keystores from [here](https://docs.wso2.com/display/ADMIN44x/Using+Asymmetric+Encryption#UsingAsymmetricEncryption-RecommendationsforsettingupkeystoresinWSO2products).\n \n \n The steps below show how to enable the Java Security Manager for WSO2 products.\n \n 1.  Download the WSO2 product to any location (e.g., `<HOME>/user/<product-pack>` folder).\n \n-2.  To sign the JARs in your product, you need a key. You can generate a new keystore\u00a0(with a new key) by executing the\u00a0keytool command given below. Note that the new keystore\u00a0is created in the directory from which you execute the keytool command.\n+2. Run the startup script in the `<PRODUCT_HOME>/bin` folder. For Linux, it is `wso2server.sh`. Once the product is up and running, shutdown the server.\n \n-    ``` java\n-        keytool -genkey -alias signFiles -keyalg RSA -keystore signkeystore.jks -validity 3650 -dname \"CN=Sanjeewa,OU=Engineering, O=WSO2, L=Colombo, ST=Western, C=LK\"\n-        Enter keystore password:  \n-        Re-enter new password:\n-        Enter key password for\n-        (RETURN if same as keystore password)\n+3.  To sign the JARs in your product, you need a key. You can generate a new keystore\u00a0(with a new key) by executing the\u00a0keytool command given below. Note that the new keystore\u00a0is created in the directory from which you execute the keytool command.\n+\n+    ```bash\n+    keytool -genkey -alias signFiles -keyalg RSA -keystore signkeystore.jks -validity 3650 -dname \"CN=John,OU=Engineering, O=WSO2, L=Colombo, ST=Western, C=LK\"\n+    Enter keystore password:  \n+    Re-enter new password:\n+    Enter key password for\n+    (RETURN if same as keystore password)\n     ```\n \n-    Now you have a new keystore\u00a0( `signkeystore.jks` ) with a new public key certificate ( `signFiles` ).\n+    Now you have a new keystore\u00a0(`signkeystore.jks`) with a new public key certificate (`signFiles`).\n \n-3.  By default, WSO2 products use the default `wso2carbon.` jks\u00a0keystore for signing JARs. This keystore\u00a0is stored in the `<PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/resources/security` directory. Therefore, you need to add\u00a0the `signFiles` public key certificate that you created earlier into the `wso2carbon.jks` keystore.\n+4.  By default, WSO2 products use the default `wso2carbon.jks`\u00a0keystore for signing JARs. This keystore\u00a0is stored in the `<PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/resources/security` directory.      Therefore, you need to add\u00a0the `signFiles` public key certificate that you created earlier into the `wso2carbon.jks` keystore.\n \n     First, export the `signFiles` public\u00a0key certificate from the `signkeystore.jks` keystore\u00a0by executing the following command:\n \n-    ``` java\n-            $ keytool -export -keystore signkeystore.jks -alias signFiles -file sign-cert.cer \n+    ```java\n+    $ keytool -export -keystore signkeystore.jks -alias signFiles -file sign-cert.cer \n     ```\n \n-    Then, import the same\u00a0signFiles\u00a0certificate to the `wso2carbon.jks` keystore\u00a0by executing the command given below. Be sure to specify the correct directory path to the `wso2carbon.jks` file of your product.\n-\n-    ``` java\n-            $ keytool -import -alias signFiles -file sign-cert.cer -keystore <PATH_to_PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/resources/security/wso2carbon.jks\n-                Enter keystore password:  \n-                Owner: CN=Sanjeewa, OU=Engineering, O=WSO2, L=Colombo, ST=Western, C=LK\n-                Issuer: CN=Sanjeewa, OU=Engineering, O=WSO2, L=Colombo, ST=Western, C=LK\n-                Serial number: 5486f3b0\n-                Valid from: Tue Dec 09 18:35:52 IST 2014 until: Fri Dec 06 18:35:52 IST 2024\n-                Certificate fingerprints:\n-                MD5:  54:13:FD:06:6F:C9:A6:BC:EE:DF:73:A9:88:CC:02:EC\n-                SHA1: AE:37:2A:9E:66:86:12:68:28:88:12:A0:85:50:B1:D1:21:BD:49:52\n-                Signature algorithm name: SHA1withRSA\n-                Version: 3\n-                Trust this certificate? [no]:  yes\n-                Certificate was added to keystore\n+    Then, import the same\u00a0`signFiles`\u00a0certificate to the `wso2carbon.jks` keystore\u00a0by executing the command given below. Be sure to specify the correct directory path to the `wso2carbon.jks` file of your product.\n+\n+    ```bash\n+    $ keytool -import -alias signFiles -file sign-cert.cer -keystore <PATH_to_PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/resources/security/wso2carbon.jks\n+    Enter keystore password:  \n+    Owner: CN=John, OU=Engineering, O=WSO2, L=Colombo, ST=Western, C=LK\n+    Issuer: CN=John, OU=Engineering, O=WSO2, L=Colombo, ST=Western, C=LK\n+    Serial number: 5486f3b0\n+    Valid from: Tue Dec 09 18:35:52 IST 2014 until: Fri Dec 06 18:35:52 IST 2024\n+    Certificate fingerprints:\n+    MD5:  54:13:FD:06:6F:C9:A6:BC:EE:DF:73:A9:88:CC:02:EC\n+    SHA1: AE:37:2A:9E:66:86:12:68:28:88:12:A0:85:50:B1:D1:21:BD:49:52\n+    Signature algorithm name: SHA1withRSA\n+    Version: 3\n+    Trust this certificate? [no]:  yes\n+    Certificate was added to keystore\n     ```\n \n-        !!! note\n-    Note that WSO2 no longer recommends MD5 for JAR signing due to cryptographic limitations.\n+    !!! note\n+        Note that WSO2 no longer recommends MD5 for JAR signing due to cryptographic limitations.\n \n \n-4.  Open the security policy file, and update the\u00a0\"grant signedBy\" value in the with the new `signFiles` alias key, as shown below.\n+5.  Open the security policy file, and update the\u00a0\"grant signedBy\" value in the with the new `signFiles` alias key, as shown below. If security policy file is not created before, create a `sec.policy` file in the `<PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf` folder and add the following content to this file.\n \n-    ``` java\n-        grant signedBy \"signFiles\" {\n-          // permission java.util.PropertyPermission \"*\", \"read\";\n-          // permission java.lang.RuntimePermission \"*\", \"*\";\n-          // permission java.io.FilePermission \"*\", \"*\";\n-          permission java.security.AllPermission;\n-        };\n+    ``` text\n+    grant signedBy \"signFiles\" {\n+      // permission java.util.PropertyPermission \"*\", \"read\";\n+      // permission java.lang.RuntimePermission \"*\", \"*\";\n+      // permission java.io.FilePermission \"*\", \"*\";\n+      permission java.security.AllPermission;\n+    };\n     ```\n \n-5.  Prepare the scripts to sign the JARs and grant them the required permission. For example, the `signJar.sh` script given below can be used to sign each JAR file separately or you can use the `signJars.sh` script, which runs a loop to read all JARs and sign them.\n+6.  Prepare the scripts to sign the JARs and **grant them the required permission**(ex: `sudo chmod 755 signJar.sh`).
