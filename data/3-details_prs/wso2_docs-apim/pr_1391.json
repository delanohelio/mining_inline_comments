AWS Lambda Endpoints\n+\n+!!! info\n+    The following fields should be specified as your requirement when setting up different endpoints in `api_params.yaml` file.\n+    \n+    -   **endpointType**\n+        \n+        To specify the type of the endpoint. Values can be `rest`, `soap`, `dynamic` or `aws`. (For HTTP/REST Endpoints, you can specify the type as `rest`. But even if you did not specify the field `endpointType` at all in the `api_params.yaml` file, by default it will take the type as `rest`)\n+    \n+    -   **endpointRoutingPolicy**\n+    \n+        To specify the routing policy to be used. Values can be `load_balanced` or `failover`.\n+    \n+    -   **loadBalanceEndpoints** field should be specified if the `endpointRoutingPolicy` is `load_balanced`. This field contains the following.\n+\n+        - `production`: An array which consists the multiple production endpoints\n+        - `sandbox`: An array which consists the multiple sandbox endpoints\n+        - `sessionManagement` (Optional): Values can be `none`, `transport`, `soap`, `simpleClientSession` and if not specified the default value would be `transport`\n+        - `sessionTimeout` (Optional): The number of milliseconds after which the session would time out\n+\n+    -   **failoverEndpoints** field should be specified if the `endpointRoutingPolicy` is `failover`. This field contains the following.\n+\n+        - `production`: The primary production endpoint (not an array)\n+        - `sandbox`: The primary sandbox endpoint (not an array)\n+        - `productionFailovers`: An array which consists failover production endpoints\n+        - `sandboxFailovers`: An array which consists failover sandbox endpoints\n+\n+    -   **awsLambdaEndpoints** field should be specified if the `endpointType` is `aws`. This field contains the following.\n+\n+        - `accessMethod`: The access method of awslambda endpoint. Mandatory to specify. (Values can be `role_supplied` or `stored`)\n+        - `amznRegion`: Region where the endpoint is located. Can be chosen from [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#regional-endpoints)\n+        - `amznAccessKey`: Access Key for endpoint\n+        - `amznSecretKey`: Access Secret for endpoint\n+\n+Let us discuss configuring each of the above endpoint type with examples, seperately, in the following sections.\n+\n+### HTTP/REST Endpoints\n+\n+This can be subdivided into three (3) main scenarios.\n+\n+#### 1. HTTP/REST Endpoint - Without load balancing or failover\n+\n+The following is an example `api_params.yaml` file for this scenario. (Note that you can ignore specifying the `endpointType` field if you want, because by default it will contain the value as `rest`.)\n+\n+!!! example\n+    ```go   \n+    environments:\n+      - name: test\n+        endpoints:\n+            production:\n+            sandbox:\n+      - name: dev\n+        endpointType: rest\n+        endpoints:\n+            production:\n+                url: https://dev.wso2.com\n+            sandbox:\n+                url: https://dev.sandbox.wso2.com\n+    ```\n+\n+#### 2. HTTP/REST Endpoint - With load balancing\n+\n+The following is an example `api_params.yaml` file for this scenario. (Note that, as mentioned in the above section, you can ignore specifying the `endpointType` field if you want, because by default it will contain the value as `rest`.)\n+\n+!!! example\n+    ```go   \n+    environments:\n+      - name: test\n+        endpoints:\n+            production:\n+            sandbox:\n+      - name: dev\n+        endpointType: rest\n+        endpointRoutingPolicy: load_balanced\n+        loadBalanceEndpoints:\n+            production:\n+                - url: https://dev1.wso2.com\n+                - url: https://dev2.wso2.com\n+            sandbox:\n+                - url: https://dev1.sandbox.wso2.com\n+                - url: https://dev2.sandbox.wso2.com\n+            sessionManagement: transport\n+            sessionTimeout: 5000\n+    ```\n+\n+#### 3. HTTP/REST Endpoint - With failover\n+\n+The following is an example `api_params.yaml` file for this scenario. (Note that, as mentioned in the above sections, you can ignore specifying the `endpointType` field if you want, because by default it will contain the value as `rest`.)", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "9084926299436d37f8cc6100c755eeb36fc49ad3"}, "originalPosition": 97}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "a0d569ee92bcee6fb30639b0c8381a3205640478", "author": {"user": {"login": "wasuradananjith", "name": "Wasura Wattearachchi"}}, "url": "https://github.com/wso2/docs-apim/commit/a0d569ee92bcee6fb30639b0c8381a3205640478", "committedDate": "2020-06-23T13:00:27Z", "message": "Change the sentences with default values to present tense"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDM1NzYyNDkx", "url": "https://github.com/wso2/docs-apim/pull/1391#pullrequestreview-435762491", "createdAt": "2020-06-23T13:08:18Z", "commit": {"oid": "a0d569ee92bcee6fb30639b0c8381a3205640478"}, "state": "APPROVED", "comments": {"totalCount": 0, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": null, "endCursor": null, "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": []}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 1833, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-02T10:47:05Z"}}}
