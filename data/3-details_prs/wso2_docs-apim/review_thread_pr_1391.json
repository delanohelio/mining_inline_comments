HTTP/REST Endpoint - Without load balancing or failover\n+\n+The following is an example `api_params.yaml` file for this scenario. (Note that you can ignore specifying the `endpointType` field if you want, because by default it will contain the value as `rest`.)\n+\n+!!! example\n+    ```go   \n+    environments:\n+      - name: test\n+        endpoints:\n+            production:\n+            sandbox:\n+      - name: dev\n+        endpointType: rest\n+        endpoints:\n+            production:\n+                url: https://dev.wso2.com\n+            sandbox:\n+                url: https://dev.sandbox.wso2.com\n+    ```\n+\n+#### 2. HTTP/REST Endpoint - With load balancing\n+\n+The following is an example `api_params.yaml` file for this scenario. (Note that, as mentioned in the above section, you can ignore specifying the `endpointType` field if you want, because by default it will contain the value as `rest`.)\n+\n+!!! example\n+    ```go   \n+    environments:\n+      - name: test\n+        endpoints:\n+            production:\n+            sandbox:\n+      - name: dev\n+        endpointType: rest\n+        endpointRoutingPolicy: load_balanced\n+        loadBalanceEndpoints:\n+            production:\n+                - url: https://dev1.wso2.com\n+                - url: https://dev2.wso2.com\n+            sandbox:\n+                - url: https://dev1.sandbox.wso2.com\n+                - url: https://dev2.sandbox.wso2.com\n+            sessionManagement: transport\n+            sessionTimeout: 5000\n+    ```\n+\n+#### 3. HTTP/REST Endpoint - With failover\n+\n+The following is an example `api_params.yaml` file for this scenario.
