Can I remove them?\n \n Yes, you can do this using the **Features** menu under the **Configure** menu of the management console (default URL is <https://localhost:9443/carbon>).\n \n-##### How can I change the memory allocation for the API Manager?\n+### How can I change the memory allocation for the API Manager?\n \n The memory allocation settings are stored in the `<API-M_HOME>/bin/wso2server.sh` file.\n \n-##### How do I start up only selected components of the API Manager?\n+### How do I start up only selected components of the API Manager?\n \n Even though the API Manager bundles all components together, you can select which component(s) you want to start by using the\u00a0`-Dprofile` command at product startup.

If you want to start several WSO2 products on a single server, you must change their default ports to avoid port conflicts. See [Changing the Default Ports with Offset]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/setup/deployment-best-practices/changing-the-default-ports-with-offset).\n \n-##### Can I install features of other WSO2 products to the API Manager?\n+### Can I install features of other WSO2 products to the API Manager?\n \n Yes, you can do this using the management console. The API Manager already has features of WSO2 Identity Server, WSO2 Governance Registry, WSO2 ESB etc. embedded in it. However, if you require more features of a certain product, it is recommended to use a separate instance of it rather than install its features to the API Manager.\n \n-##### How can I continue to use my email address as the username in a distributed API-M deployment?\n+### How can I continue to use my email address as the username in a distributed API-M deployment?\n \n-To enable using your email (e.g., `admin@wso2.com`) as your username when deploying WSO2 API-M and WSO2 Identity Server (WSO2 IS), while doing master configurations, do the following.\n+To enable using your email (e.g., `admin@wso2.com`) as your username when deploying WSO2 API-M and WSO2 Identity Server (WSO2 IS), while doing master configurations, do the following in the `<API-M_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment toml` file.
