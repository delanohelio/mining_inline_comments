The Dev-Ops and managers can use the interactive widgets support to identify and drill down information related to the API's and the application's traffic patterns, errors, latencies, etc., and isolate the issues.\n+      Having an idea about the overall health status of APIs and Services is essential for the proper functioning of an API-driven business. Monitoring Dashboard helps to achieve this objective by showing contextual information on APIs such as Latency, Throughput, Errors, and Traffic Volume. Operational and Management users can use this dashboard to identify operational errors, narrow down the root cause, or to identify common traffic trends. The overview page provides a holistic view by aggregating different views on APIs, and by following the drill-downs user can get a detailed picture of different perspectives. \n \n-- Reorganize Analytics dashboards\n+- Re-organized Analytics dashboards\n         \n-      The Analytics dashboards are reorganized to reflect the type of information.
