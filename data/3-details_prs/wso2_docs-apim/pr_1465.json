If you want to start several WSO2 products on a single server, you must change their default ports to avoid port conflicts.

The API Manager already has features of WSO2 Identity Server, WSO2 Governance Registry, WSO2 ESB etc. embedded in it. However, if you require more features of a certain product, it is recommended to use a separate instance of it rather than install its features to the API Manager.\n \n-##### How can I continue to use my email address as the username in a distributed API-M deployment?\n+### How can I continue to use my email address as the username in a distributed API-M deployment?\n \n-To enable using your email (e.g., `admin@wso2.com`) as your username when deploying WSO2 API-M and WSO2 Identity Server (WSO2 IS), while doing master configurations, do the following.\n+To enable using your email (e.g., `admin@wso2.com`) as your username when deploying WSO2 API-M and WSO2 Identity Server (WSO2 IS), while doing master configurations, do the following in the `<API-M_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment toml` file.
