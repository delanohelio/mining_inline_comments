This feature is available in any WSO2 IS version from 4.1.0 onwards. WSO2 IS 5.9.0 is used in this guide. WSO2 Identity Server acts as an identity Service Provider of systems enabled with single sign-on, while the Web applications act as SSO Service Providers. Using this feature, you can configure SSO with SAML 2.0 across the API Publisher and Developer Portal. After configuring, you can access the Developer Portal or API Publisher in a single authentication attempt.\n+\n+## Prerequisites\n+\n+1. Download the API Manager 3.0.0 distribution.\n+     1.
