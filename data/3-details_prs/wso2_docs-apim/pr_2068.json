This feature is available in any WSO2 IS version from 4.1.0 onwards. WSO2 IS 5.10.0 is used in this guide. WSO2 Identity Server acts as an identity service provider of systems enabled with single sign-on, while the Web applications act as SSO service providers. Using this feature, you can configure SSO with SAML 2.0 across the API Publisher and Developer Portal. After configuring, you can access the Developer Portal or API Publisher in a single authentication attempt.\n+\n+## Pre-requisites\n+\n+-   Download the API Manager distribution from [https://wso2.com/api-management/](https://wso2.com/api-management/).\n+\n+-   Download the Identity Server distirbution from [https://wso2.com/identity-and-access-management/](https://wso2.com/identity-and-access-management/).\n+\n+    !!!

Tip\n+            Instead of using the default internal roles, you can also create new roles in API Manager and map it to the provisioned users. \n+\n+### Step - 2 Configure the Service Provider\n+\n+1.  Navigate to **Service Providers** section and list the Service Providers. There are two service providers created for Publisher portal and Developer portal named as `apim_publisher` and `apim_devportal`. Edit the `apim_publisher` service provider.\n+\n+    !!! Attention\n+        You will have to log into the Developer Portal and Publisher at least once for the two service providers to appear as it is created during first login.\n+\n+2.  Expand the **Local & Outbound Authentication Configuration** section and select **Federated Authentication** as Authentication Type and select the name of the Identity Provider you created in Step 5 and update. \n+\n+    [![]({{base_path}}/assets/img/setup-and-install/local-and-outbound-authentication-configuration-for-sso.png)]({{base_path}}/assets/img/setup-and-install/local-and-outbound-authentication-configuration-for-sso.png)\n+\n+3.  Repeat the same step for apim_devportal Service Provider as well.\n+\n+Now you will be able to login to Publisher and Devportal using the users in WSO2 Identity Server.\n+\n+!!! Tip \"Troubleshooting\"\n+    When using Identity Server as external IdP, following error can be observed in API Manager, when login to Portals. \n+\n+    ``` code\n+        invalid_request, The client MUST NOT use more than one authentication method in each\n+    ```\n+\n+    It is because MutualTLS authenticator is enabled by default in, from IS 5.8.0 onwards. Since the OIDC specification does not allow to use more than one authentication, the login fails with above error. In order to resolve this issue, add following configuration in the deployment.toml resides in <IS-Home>/repository/conf directory to disable the MutualTLS authenticator in IS.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "424760b4f6e687c0929925c2ac5b7d2f667cf88c"}, "originalPosition": 194}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "36761cbdd9ac734d79b15a67144263d4876a0bf5", "author": {"user": {"login": "Mariangela", "name": "Mariangela Hills"}}, "url": "https://github.com/wso2/docs-apim/commit/36761cbdd9ac734d79b15a67144263d4876a0bf5", "committedDate": "2020-11-03T10:20:29Z", "message": "Reviewed and updated full doc"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "6c13fe5d8f299cbd5dc438a14bf22da226414041", "author": {"user": {"login": "Mariangela", "name": "Mariangela Hills"}}, "url": "https://github.com/wso2/docs-apim/commit/6c13fe5d8f299cbd5dc438a14bf22da226414041", "committedDate": "2020-11-03T12:54:16Z", "message": "Further updated"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "476fd8c4efa708f8c5540b6bf2c4161cac025a7a", "author": {"user": {"login": "Mariangela", "name": "Mariangela Hills"}}, "url": "https://github.com/wso2/docs-apim/commit/476fd8c4efa708f8c5540b6bf2c4161cac025a7a", "committedDate": "2020-11-03T13:50:05Z", "message": "Reviewed and updated the full doc"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "32bfe14552a634a4f8238ab6e7ddff6e92951d70", "author": {"user": {"login": "Mariangela", "name": "Mariangela Hills"}}, "url": "https://github.com/wso2/docs-apim/commit/32bfe14552a634a4f8238ab6e7ddff6e92951d70", "committedDate": "2020-11-03T13:51:29Z", "message": "Reviewed and updated the fix"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NTIyNTU5MDQ3", "url": "https://github.com/wso2/docs-apim/pull/2068#pullrequestreview-522559047", "createdAt": "2020-11-03T14:36:39Z", "commit": {"oid": "32bfe14552a634a4f8238ab6e7ddff6e92951d70"}, "state": "CHANGES_REQUESTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 0, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": null, "endCursor": null, "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": []}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "ec09d2f8537973ffa4d7d65f225a64ae62063e50", "author": {"user": {"login": "Mariangela", "name": "Mariangela Hills"}}, "url": "https://github.com/wso2/docs-apim/commit/ec09d2f8537973ffa4d7d65f225a64ae62063e50", "committedDate": "2020-11-03T14:42:41Z", "message": "Updated"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "a9d94eb307f98a0909bb91c53ce18c5eb519966a", "author": {"user": {"login": "Mariangela", "name": "Mariangela Hills"}}, "url": "https://github.com/wso2/docs-apim/commit/a9d94eb307f98a0909bb91c53ce18c5eb519966a", "committedDate": "2020-11-03T14:46:23Z", "message": "Updated further"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "0a82e0143f1344e367be55e3d0712f79cb993fb1", "author": {"user": {"login": "Mariangela", "name": "Mariangela Hills"}}, "url": "https://github.com/wso2/docs-apim/commit/0a82e0143f1344e367be55e3d0712f79cb993fb1", "committedDate": "2020-11-03T18:17:21Z", "message": "Reviewed and updated fix"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "1bfe94ea761d3d5ab39582988bf759195b201898", "author": {"user": {"login": "vithu30", "name": "Vithursa"}}, "url": "https://github.com/wso2/docs-apim/commit/1bfe94ea761d3d5ab39582988bf759195b201898", "committedDate": "2020-11-04T01:49:23Z", "message": "Renamed image"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "7601ccc296fc56289e4048a9e495978a85341669", "author": {"user": {"login": "vithu30", "name": "Vithursa"}}, "url": "https://github.com/wso2/docs-apim/commit/7601ccc296fc56289e4048a9e495978a85341669", "committedDate": "2020-11-04T01:52:06Z", "message": "Resolved conflicts"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NTIzMDY4NDEz", "url": "https://github.com/wso2/docs-apim/pull/2068#pullrequestreview-523068413", "createdAt": "2020-11-04T06:18:56Z", "commit": {"oid": "7601ccc296fc56289e4048a9e495978a85341669"}, "state": "APPROVED", "comments": {"totalCount": 0, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": null, "endCursor": null, "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": []}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 1605, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-02T10:47:05Z"}}}
