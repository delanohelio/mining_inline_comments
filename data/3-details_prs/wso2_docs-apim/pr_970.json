You can then run the Management Console application to configure and manage the product.\n \n-#### Before you begin\n-\n--   When you move into a production environment, it is recommended to grant restricted access to the management console. See [Securing Carbon Applications](https://docs.wso2.com/display/ADMIN44x/Securing+Carbon+Applications) for instructions.\n--   The `config-validation.xml` file\u00a0in\u00a0the `<PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/etc` directory\u00a0contains a list of recommended system parameters, which are validated against your system when the server starts. See [Configuring config-validation.xml](https://docs.wso2.com/display/ADMIN44x/Configuring+config-validation.xml) for details on modifying these parameters before starting the server.\n--   The Management Console uses the default [HTTP-NIO transport](https://docs.wso2.com/display/ADMIN44x/HTTP-NIO+Transport) , which is configured in\u00a0the `catalina-server.xml` file\u00a0in\u00a0the `<PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/tomcat` directory. This transport must be properly configured in this file for the management console to be accessible.\n--   As explained in the [installation prerequisites](#ProductionDeploymentGuidelines-installation_prerequisites) , the default product installation uses OpenJDK.
