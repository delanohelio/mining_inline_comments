First, you must create a new\n+discord bot at [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).\n+\n+1. Once on that page, click on \"New Application\" button on the top right, give your bot a name, and\n+then click \"Create\".\n+> ![Creating Application](https://i.imgur.com/8ffp4R1.gif)\n+> `New Application` -> Give Application a Name -> `Create`\n+\n+2. Once you create the application, you'll be directed to its overview. From this screen, you'll\n+need to copy your \"Client ID\" and save it for a later step. To copy your client id, click the\n+upper-left most blue \"Copy\" button. Make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Copy Client ID](https://i.imgur.com/W3OMTu5.gif)\n+> `Copy` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+3. Optionally, you can set an icon for your application as it will be the icon for the bot too.\n+> ![Avatar](https://i.imgur.com/NuFS9kT.png)\n+\n+4. The next step is actually creating a bot user for your application. From the overview screen,\n+this is done by going to the \"Bot\" tab on the left, then clicking the \"Add Bot\" on the right,\n+and finally then clicking \"Yes, do it!\".\n+> ![Create Bot](https://i.imgur.com/S14iAFS.gif)\n+> `Bot` -> `Add Bot` -> `Yes, do it!`\n+\n+5.

Finally, you'll need to copy your bot's token and save it for a later step. To copy your bot's token,\n+click the blue \"Copy\" button right of your bot's icon. Make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Copy Token](https://i.imgur.com/OqpaSQH.gif)\n+> `Copy` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+   \n+7. Next up is adding your bot to your discord server. First, goto [essentialsx.net/discord.html](https://essentialsx.net/discord.html)\n+and paste your Client ID you copied from step 2 into the text box on that page. Once you do that, click\n+the \"Authorize\" button next to the text box. This will redirect you to Discord's authorization website \n+to chose which server to add the bot to. Note for advanced users: Please use the `essentialsx.net` website above \n+even if you think you already know how to invite bots.

For the next few steps, you're going to need to do some stuff in discord, so start up your\n+Discord desktop/web client. \n+\n+10. Once in your Discord client, you'll need to enable developer mode. Do this by going into the \n+Settings, then go to the \"Appearance\" tab and check on the \"Developer Mode\" at the bottom of the\n+page.

Before starting your server, there are a few steps you have to take. First, you must create a new\n+discord bot at [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).\n+\n+1. Once on that page, click on \"New Application\" button on the top right, give your bot a name, and\n+then click \"Create\".\n+> ![Creating Application](https://i.imgur.com/8ffp4R1.gif)\n+> `New Application` -> Give Application a Name -> `Create`\n+\n+2. Once you create the application, you'll be directed to its overview. From this screen, you'll\n+need to copy your \"Client ID\" and save it for a later step. To copy your client id, click the\n+upper-left most blue \"Copy\" button. Make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Copy Client ID](https://i.imgur.com/W3OMTu5.gif)\n+> `Copy` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+3.

The next step is actually creating a bot user for your application. From the overview screen,\n+this is done by going to the \"Bot\" tab on the left, then clicking the \"Add Bot\" on the right,\n+and finally then clicking \"Yes, do it!\".\n+> ![Create Bot](https://i.imgur.com/S14iAFS.gif)\n+> `Bot` -> `Add Bot` -> `Yes, do it!`\n+\n+5.

Make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Copy Token](https://i.imgur.com/OqpaSQH.gif)\n+> `Copy` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+   \n+7. Next up is adding your bot to your discord server. First, goto [essentialsx.net/discord.html](https://essentialsx.net/discord.html)\n+and paste your Client ID you copied from step 2 into the text box on that page. Once you do that, click\n+the \"Authorize\" button next to the text box. This will redirect you to Discord's authorization website \n+to chose which server to add the bot to.

For the next few steps, you're going to need to do some stuff in discord, so start up your\n+Discord desktop/web client. \n+\n+10. Once in your Discord client, you'll need to enable developer mode. Do this by going into the \n+Settings, then go to the \"Appearance\" tab and check on the \"Developer Mode\" at the bottom of the\n+page. Once you've checked \"Developer Mode\" on, click the `X` at the top right to exit Settings.\n+> ![Developer Mode](https://i.imgur.com/CrW31Up.gif)\n+> `User Settings` -> `Appearance` -> Check `Developer Mode` -> Exit Settings\n+\n+11.

The other ID you need to copy is the ID of the channel you wish to be your primary channel.\n+In other words, this will be the channel that, by default, receives messages for player chat/join/leave/death\n+messages as well as mute/kicks.

You've successfully copied all the necessary IDs needed for a basic setup. Next up is generating the\n+default config for EssentialsXDiscord, so you can start setting it up! Do this by putting the\n+EssentialsXDiscord jar (you can download it [here](https://essentialsx.net/downloads.html) if you do not\n+already have one) in your plugins folder, starting your server, and then stopping it as soon as it finishes\n+starting up.\n+> ![Start/Stop Server](https://i.imgur.com/JQX6hqM.gif)\n+> Drag EssentialsXDiscord jar into plugins folder -> Start Server -> Stop Server\n+\n+14. Now you can start to configure the plugin with all the stuff you copied from earlier. Open the config\n+for EssentialsXDiscord located at `plugins/EssentialsDiscord/config.yml`. When you open the config, the\n+first thing to configure is your bot's token. Replace `INSERT-TOKEN-HERE` in the config with the token you\n+copied earlier from step 6.\n+> ![Paste Token](https://i.imgur.com/EnD31Wg.gif)\n+> Re-Copy Token from Step 6 -> Paste as token value \n+\n+15. Next, is the guild id, replace the zeros for the guild value in the config with the guild id you copied\n+from step 13.\n+> ![Paste Guild](https://i.imgur.com/YxkHykd.gif)\n+\n+16. Finally, you'll need to paste the primary channel id you copied from step 14 and paste it as the\n+primary value in the channels section and once you've done that save the config file!\n+> ![Paste Primary](https://i.imgur.com/4xaHMfO.gif)\n+\n+17.

Next is copying a few IDs. First up, you'll want to copy the server (aka guild) id. Do this by\n+finding the server you added the bot to, right click its icon, and click \"Copy ID\". Once you copied\n+it, make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Guild ID](https://i.imgur.com/0mg2yT3.gif)\n+> Right click server -> `Copy ID` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+12. The other ID you need to copy is the ID of the channel you wish to be your primary channel.\n+In other words, this will be the channel that, by default, receives messages for player chat/join/leave/death\n+messages as well as mute/kicks. To see how to further configure message types, see [Configuring Messages](#configuring-messages).\n+> ![Primary Channel ID](https://i.imgur.com/uMODfiQ.gif)\n+> Right click your 'primary' channel -> `Copy ID` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+13. You've successfully copied all the necessary IDs needed for a basic setup. Next up is generating the\n+default config for EssentialsXDiscord, so you can start setting it up! Do this by putting the\n+EssentialsXDiscord jar (you can download it [here](https://essentialsx.net/downloads.html) if you do not\n+already have one) in your plugins folder, starting your server, and then stopping it as soon as it finishes\n+starting up.\n+> ![Start/Stop Server](https://i.imgur.com/JQX6hqM.gif)\n+> Drag EssentialsXDiscord jar into plugins folder -> Start Server -> Stop Server\n+\n+14. Now you can start to configure the plugin with all the stuff you copied from earlier. Open the config\n+for EssentialsXDiscord located at `plugins/EssentialsDiscord/config.yml`. When you open the config, the\n+first thing to configure is your bot's token. Replace `INSERT-TOKEN-HERE` in the config with the token you\n+copied earlier from step 6.\n+> ![Paste Token](https://i.imgur.com/EnD31Wg.gif)\n+> Re-Copy Token from Step 6 -> Paste as token value \n+\n+15. Next, is the guild id, replace the zeros for the guild value in the config with the guild id you copied\n+from step 13.\n+> ![Paste Guild](https://i.imgur.com/YxkHykd.gif)\n+\n+16. Finally, you'll need to paste the primary channel id you copied from step 14 and paste it as the\n+primary value in the channels section and once you've done that save the config file!\n+> ![Paste Primary](https://i.imgur.com/4xaHMfO.gif)\n+\n+17. Congratulations, you've completed the initial setup guide! When you start up your server, you should\n+notice that chat and other messages start showing up in the channel you requested they be.

Once\n+you paste it, make sure you save the config.\n+> ![Paste ID](https://i.imgur.com/NicdpGw.gif)\n+\n+3. Finally, if your server is running, run `ess reload` from your console, otherwise start up your server. You\n+should notice console output being directed to that channel!

Before starting your server, there are a few steps you have to take.

Once on that page, click on \"New Application\" button on the top right, give your bot a name, and\n+then click \"Create\".\n+> ![Creating Application](https://i.imgur.com/8ffp4R1.gif)\n+> `New Application` -> Give Application a Name -> `Create`\n+\n+2. Once you create the application, you'll be directed to its overview. From this screen, you'll\n+need to copy your \"Client ID\" and save it for a later step. To copy your client id, click the\n+upper-left most blue \"Copy\" button. Make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Copy Client ID](https://i.imgur.com/W3OMTu5.gif)\n+> `Copy` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+3.

The next step is actually creating a bot user for your application. From the overview screen,\n+this is done by going to the \"Bot\" tab on the left, then clicking the \"Add Bot\" on the right,\n+and finally then clicking \"Yes, do it!\".\n+> ![Create Bot](https://i.imgur.com/S14iAFS.gif)\n+> `Bot` -> `Add Bot` -> `Yes, do it!`\n+\n+5.

Before starting your server, there are a few steps you have to take. First, you must create a new\n+discord bot at [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).\n+\n+1. Once on that page, click on \"New Application\" button on the top right, give your bot a name, and\n+then click \"Create\".\n+> ![Creating Application](https://i.imgur.com/8ffp4R1.gif)\n+> `New Application` -> Give Application a Name -> `Create`\n+\n+2. Once you create the application, you'll be directed to its overview. From this screen, you'll\n+need to copy your \"Client ID\" and save it for a later step. To copy your client id, click the\n+upper-left most blue \"Copy\" button. Make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Copy Client ID](https://i.imgur.com/W3OMTu5.gif)\n+> `Copy` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+3. Optionally, you can set an icon for your application as it will be the icon for the bot too.\n+> ![Avatar](https://i.imgur.com/NuFS9kT.png)\n+\n+4. The next step is actually creating a bot user for your application. From the overview screen,\n+this is done by going to the \"Bot\" tab on the left, then clicking the \"Add Bot\" on the right,\n+and finally then clicking \"Yes, do it!\".\n+> ![Create Bot](https://i.imgur.com/S14iAFS.gif)\n+> `Bot` -> `Add Bot` -> `Yes, do it!`\n+\n+5. Once on this screen, you'll need to uncheck the \"Public Bot\" setting and then click \"Save Changes\",\n+so other people can't add your bot to servers that are not your own.\n+> ![Disable Public Bot](https://i.imgur.com/HHqWvQ1.gif)\n+> Uncheck `Public Bot` -> `Save Changes`\n+\n+6. Finally, you'll need to copy your bot's token and save it for a later step. To copy your bot's token,\n+click the blue \"Copy\" button right of your bot's icon. Make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Copy Token](https://i.imgur.com/OqpaSQH.gif)\n+> `Copy` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+   \n+7. Next up is adding your bot to your discord server. First, goto [essentialsx.net/discord.html](https://essentialsx.net/discord.html)\n+and paste your Client ID you copied from step 2 into the text box on that page. Once you do that, click\n+the \"Authorize\" button next to the text box. This will redirect you to Discord's authorization website \n+to chose which server to add the bot to. Note for advanced users: Please use the `essentialsx.net` website above \n+even if you think you already know how to invite bots. Bots for EssentialsXDiscord require more than just the `bot`\n+scope to work, so please just use the link above even if you think you know what you're doing.\n+> ![OAuth Link Gen](https://i.imgur.com/u6MFJgQ.gif)\n+> Paste Client ID -> `Authorize`\n+\n+8. Once on the Discord authorization website, select the server from the \"Select a server\" dropdown \n+that you want to add the bot to. Then click the \"Authorize\" button. You may be prompted to confirm\n+you are not a bot, proceed with that like you would any other captcha.\n+> ![Authorize](https://i.imgur.com/KXkESqC.gif)\n+> Select Server -> `Authorize`\n+\n+9. For the next few steps, you're going to need to do some stuff in discord, so start up your\n+Discord desktop/web client. \n+\n+10. Once in your Discord client, you'll need to enable developer mode. Do this by going into the \n+Settings, then go to the \"Appearance\" tab and check on the \"Developer Mode\" at the bottom of the\n+page. Once you've checked \"Developer Mode\" on, click the `X` at the top right to exit Settings.\n+> ![Developer Mode](https://i.imgur.com/CrW31Up.gif)\n+> `User Settings` -> `Appearance` -> Check `Developer Mode` -> Exit Settings\n+\n+11. Next is copying a few IDs. First up, you'll want to copy the server (aka guild) id. Do this by\n+finding the server you added the bot to, right click its icon, and click \"Copy ID\". Once you copied\n+it, make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Guild ID](https://i.imgur.com/0mg2yT3.gif)\n+> Right click server -> `Copy ID` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+12. The other ID you need to copy is the ID of the channel you wish to be your primary channel.\n+In other words, this will be the channel that, by default, receives messages for player chat/join/leave/death\n+messages as well as mute/kicks. To see how to further configure message types, see [Configuring Messages](#configuring-messages).\n+> ![Primary Channel ID](https://i.imgur.com/uMODfiQ.gif)\n+> Right click your 'primary' channel -> `Copy ID` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+13. You've successfully copied all the necessary IDs needed for a basic setup. Next up is generating the\n+default config for EssentialsXDiscord, so you can start setting it up! Do this by putting the\n+EssentialsXDiscord jar (you can download it [here](https://essentialsx.net/downloads.html) if you do not\n+already have one) in your plugins folder, starting your server, and then stopping it as soon as it finishes\n+starting up.\n+> ![Start/Stop Server](https://i.imgur.com/JQX6hqM.gif)\n+> Drag EssentialsXDiscord jar into plugins folder -> Start Server -> Stop Server\n+\n+14. Now you can start to configure the plugin with all the stuff you copied from earlier. Open the config\n+for EssentialsXDiscord located at `plugins/EssentialsDiscord/config.yml`. When you open the config, the\n+first thing to configure is your bot's token. Replace `INSERT-TOKEN-HERE` in the config with the token you\n+copied earlier from step 6.\n+> ![Paste Token](https://i.imgur.com/EnD31Wg.gif)\n+> Re-Copy Token from Step 6 -> Paste as token value \n+\n+15. Next, is the guild id, replace the zeros for the guild value in the config with the guild id you copied\n+from step 13.\n+> ![Paste Guild](https://i.imgur.com/YxkHykd.gif)\n+\n+16. Finally, you'll need to paste the primary channel id you copied from step 14 and paste it as the\n+primary value in the channels section and once you've done that save the config file!\n+> ![Paste Primary](https://i.imgur.com/4xaHMfO.gif)\n+\n+17. Congratulations, you've completed the initial setup guide! When you start up your server, you should\n+notice that chat and other messages start showing up in the channel you requested they be. Now that you\n+completed the initial, go back up to the [Table Of Contents](#table-of-contents) to see what other cool things you can do!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Console Relay\n+The console relay is pretty self-explanatory: it relays everything on your console into discord channel of\n+your choosing. The console relay is ridiculously easy to setup and if your server is already running, you don't\n+need to reload it!\n+\n+0. This assumes you've already done the initial setup.\n+\n+1. Go to the discord server that your bot is in and find the channel you wish to use for console output.\n+Right click on the channel and click \"Copy ID\". Save this id for the next step.\n+> ![Copy ID](https://i.imgur.com/qvDfSLv.gif)\n+> Find console channel -> Right Click -> `Copy ID`\n+\n+2. Now that you have that copied, open the EssentialsXDiscord config and find the `console` section. In that\n+section, replace the zeros for the `channel` value with the channel id you copied from the last step. Once\n+you paste it, make sure you save the config.\n+> ![Paste ID](https://i.imgur.com/NicdpGw.gif)\n+\n+3. Finally, if your server is running, run `ess reload` from your console, otherwise start up your server. You\n+should notice console output being directed to that channel! That is all you need if you're okay with the default\n+settings. Otherwise, if you'd like to see what other options you can use to customize console output, stick around.\n+\n+4. The first thing you can customize is the format of the message sent to discord. By default, the timestamp,\n+level (info/warn/error/etc), and message are shown for each console message. Let's say you wanted to make the\n+timestamp and level bold, since this message would be using discord markdown, we can just add \\*\\* to both sides of\n+level and timestamp. Then once you've done that, just do `/ess reload` and you should see your changes on discord.\n+> ![Bold Format](https://i.imgur.com/jD9mH14.gif)\n+\n+5. Next, you can also configure the name you wish the to show above console messages. By default, it's \"EssX Console\n+Relay\" but can be switched to anything you want.\n+> ![Change Name](https://i.imgur.com/xtrt1Jt.gif)\n+\n+6. Finally, you can also choose to enable an option to treat any message by a user in the console channel as a\n+console command. This will mean that anyone who can send messages in your console channel **will be able to execute \n+commands as the console**. It is suggested that you stick to the regular `/execute` command \n+(see [Discord Commands](#discord-commands)) as those can be restricted to specific roles/users and are also not\n+restricted to the console channel.\n+> ![Command Relay](https://i.imgur.com/w3cfVUw.gif)\n+\n+7.

Before starting your server, there are a few steps you have to take. First, you must create a new\n+discord bot at [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).\n+\n+1. Once on that page, click on \"New Application\" button on the top right, give your bot a name, and\n+then click \"Create\".\n+> ![Creating Application](https://i.imgur.com/8ffp4R1.gif)\n+> `New Application` -> Give Application a Name -> `Create`\n+\n+2. Once you create the application, you'll be directed to its overview. From this screen, you'll\n+need to copy your \"Client ID\" and save it for a later step. To copy your client id, click the\n+upper-left most blue \"Copy\" button. Make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Copy Client ID](https://i.imgur.com/W3OMTu5.gif)\n+> `Copy` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+3. Optionally, you can set an icon for your application as it will be the icon for the bot too.\n+> ![Avatar](https://i.imgur.com/NuFS9kT.png)\n+\n+4. The next step is actually creating a bot user for your application. From the overview screen,\n+this is done by going to the \"Bot\" tab on the left, then clicking the \"Add Bot\" on the right,\n+and finally then clicking \"Yes, do it!\".\n+> ![Create Bot](https://i.imgur.com/S14iAFS.gif)\n+> `Bot` -> `Add Bot` -> `Yes, do it!`\n+\n+5. Once on this screen, you'll need to uncheck the \"Public Bot\" setting and then click \"Save Changes\",\n+so other people can't add your bot to servers that are not your own.\n+> ![Disable Public Bot](https://i.imgur.com/HHqWvQ1.gif)\n+> Uncheck `Public Bot` -> `Save Changes`\n+\n+6. Finally, you'll need to copy your bot's token and save it for a later step. To copy your bot's token,\n+click the blue \"Copy\" button right of your bot's icon. Make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Copy Token](https://i.imgur.com/OqpaSQH.gif)\n+> `Copy` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+   \n+7. Next up is adding your bot to your discord server. First, goto [essentialsx.net/discord.html](https://essentialsx.net/discord.html)\n+and paste your Client ID you copied from step 2 into the text box on that page. Once you do that, click\n+the \"Authorize\" button next to the text box. This will redirect you to Discord's authorization website \n+to chose which server to add the bot to. Note for advanced users: Please use the `essentialsx.net` website above \n+even if you think you already know how to invite bots. Bots for EssentialsXDiscord require more than just the `bot`\n+scope to work, so please just use the link above even if you think you know what you're doing.\n+> ![OAuth Link Gen](https://i.imgur.com/u6MFJgQ.gif)\n+> Paste Client ID -> `Authorize`\n+\n+8. Once on the Discord authorization website, select the server from the \"Select a server\" dropdown \n+that you want to add the bot to. Then click the \"Authorize\" button. You may be prompted to confirm\n+you are not a bot, proceed with that like you would any other captcha.\n+> ![Authorize](https://i.imgur.com/KXkESqC.gif)\n+> Select Server -> `Authorize`\n+\n+9. For the next few steps, you're going to need to do some stuff in discord, so start up your\n+Discord desktop/web client. \n+\n+10. Once in your Discord client, you'll need to enable developer mode. Do this by going into the \n+Settings, then go to the \"Appearance\" tab and check on the \"Developer Mode\" at the bottom of the\n+page. Once you've checked \"Developer Mode\" on, click the `X` at the top right to exit Settings.\n+> ![Developer Mode](https://i.imgur.com/CrW31Up.gif)\n+> `User Settings` -> `Appearance` -> Check `Developer Mode` -> Exit Settings\n+\n+11. Next is copying a few IDs. First up, you'll want to copy the server (aka guild) id. Do this by\n+finding the server you added the bot to, right click its icon, and click \"Copy ID\". Once you copied\n+it, make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Guild ID](https://i.imgur.com/0mg2yT3.gif)\n+> Right click server -> `Copy ID` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+12. The other ID you need to copy is the ID of the channel you wish to be your primary channel.\n+In other words, this will be the channel that, by default, receives messages for player chat/join/leave/death\n+messages as well as mute/kicks. To see how to further configure message types, see [Configuring Messages](#configuring-messages).\n+> ![Primary Channel ID](https://i.imgur.com/uMODfiQ.gif)\n+> Right click your 'primary' channel -> `Copy ID` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+13. You've successfully copied all the necessary IDs needed for a basic setup. Next up is generating the\n+default config for EssentialsXDiscord, so you can start setting it up! Do this by putting the\n+EssentialsXDiscord jar (you can download it [here](https://essentialsx.net/downloads.html) if you do not\n+already have one) in your plugins folder, starting your server, and then stopping it as soon as it finishes\n+starting up.\n+> ![Start/Stop Server](https://i.imgur.com/JQX6hqM.gif)\n+> Drag EssentialsXDiscord jar into plugins folder -> Start Server -> Stop Server\n+\n+14. Now you can start to configure the plugin with all the stuff you copied from earlier. Open the config\n+for EssentialsXDiscord located at `plugins/EssentialsDiscord/config.yml`. When you open the config, the\n+first thing to configure is your bot's token. Replace `INSERT-TOKEN-HERE` in the config with the token you\n+copied earlier from step 6.\n+> ![Paste Token](https://i.imgur.com/EnD31Wg.gif)\n+> Re-Copy Token from Step 6 -> Paste as token value \n+\n+15. Next, is the guild id, replace the zeros for the guild value in the config with the guild id you copied\n+from step 13.\n+> ![Paste Guild](https://i.imgur.com/YxkHykd.gif)\n+\n+16. Finally, you'll need to paste the primary channel id you copied from step 14 and paste it as the\n+primary value in the channels section and once you've done that save the config file!\n+> ![Paste Primary](https://i.imgur.com/4xaHMfO.gif)\n+\n+17. Congratulations, you've completed the initial setup guide! When you start up your server, you should\n+notice that chat and other messages start showing up in the channel you requested they be. Now that you\n+completed the initial, go back up to the [Table Of Contents](#table-of-contents) to see what other cool things you can do!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Console Relay\n+The console relay is pretty self-explanatory: it relays everything on your console into discord channel of\n+your choosing. The console relay is ridiculously easy to setup and if your server is already running, you don't\n+need to reload it!\n+\n+0. This assumes you've already done the initial setup.\n+\n+1. Go to the discord server that your bot is in and find the channel you wish to use for console output.\n+Right click on the channel and click \"Copy ID\". Save this id for the next step.\n+> ![Copy ID](https://i.imgur.com/qvDfSLv.gif)\n+> Find console channel -> Right Click -> `Copy ID`\n+\n+2. Now that you have that copied, open the EssentialsXDiscord config and find the `console` section. In that\n+section, replace the zeros for the `channel` value with the channel id you copied from the last step. Once\n+you paste it, make sure you save the config.\n+> ![Paste ID](https://i.imgur.com/NicdpGw.gif)\n+\n+3. Finally, if your server is running, run `ess reload` from your console, otherwise start up your server. You\n+should notice console output being directed to that channel! That is all you need if you're okay with the default\n+settings. Otherwise, if you'd like to see what other options you can use to customize console output, stick around.\n+\n+4. The first thing you can customize is the format of the message sent to discord. By default, the timestamp,\n+level (info/warn/error/etc), and message are shown for each console message. Let's say you wanted to make the\n+timestamp and level bold, since this message would be using discord markdown, we can just add \\*\\* to both sides of\n+level and timestamp. Then once you've done that, just do `/ess reload` and you should see your changes on discord.\n+> ![Bold Format](https://i.imgur.com/jD9mH14.gif)\n+\n+5. Next, you can also configure the name you wish the to show above console messages. By default, it's \"EssX Console\n+Relay\" but can be switched to anything you want.\n+> ![Change Name](https://i.imgur.com/xtrt1Jt.gif)\n+\n+6. Finally, you can also choose to enable an option to treat any message by a user in the console channel as a\n+console command. This will mean that anyone who can send messages in your console channel **will be able to execute \n+commands as the console**. It is suggested that you stick to the regular `/execute` command \n+(see [Discord Commands](#discord-commands)) as those can be restricted to specific roles/users and are also not\n+restricted to the console channel.\n+> ![Command Relay](https://i.imgur.com/w3cfVUw.gif)\n+\n+7. That's all the options for the command relay!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Configuring Messages\n+EssentialsXDiscord aims to keep its message-type system basic enough that simple things take little changes, while\n+giving more fine grain control to those you want it.\n+\n+To give you a general overview of the system, EssentialsXDiscord allows you to define different channel IDs in the\n+`channels` section of the config. By default, two channels are pre-populated in the `channels` section, `primary`\n+and `staff`. If you only completed the initial setup, the `staff` channel definition is all zeros. This is fine in\n+most situations however, as the message system will always fallback to the `primary` channel if a channel ID is\n+invalid.\n+\n+Now on the to the types of messages you can receive themselves (which is where you're going to use these channel \n+definitions). In the `message-types` section of the config, you can see a list of message types (join/leave/chat/etc)\n+on the left (as the key), and on the right there is a channel definition.\n+\n+For the sake of example lets say we want to send all chat messages to their own channel. We can do this by creating\n+a new channel definition and setting the `chat` message type to said channel definition. Below are step-by-step \n+instructions for said example, you can follow along to get the gist of how to apply this to other use cases\n+\n+1.

Before starting your server, there are a few steps you have to take. First, you must create a new\n+discord bot at [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).\n+\n+1. Once on that page, click on \"New Application\" button on the top right, give your bot a name, and\n+then click \"Create\".\n+> ![Creating Application](https://i.imgur.com/8ffp4R1.gif)\n+> `New Application` -> Give Application a Name -> `Create`\n+\n+2. Once you create the application, you'll be directed to its overview. From this screen, you'll\n+need to copy your \"Client ID\" and save it for a later step. To copy your client id, click the\n+upper-left most blue \"Copy\" button. Make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Copy Client ID](https://i.imgur.com/W3OMTu5.gif)\n+> `Copy` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+3. Optionally, you can set an icon for your application as it will be the icon for the bot too.\n+> ![Avatar](https://i.imgur.com/NuFS9kT.png)\n+\n+4. The next step is actually creating a bot user for your application. From the overview screen,\n+this is done by going to the \"Bot\" tab on the left, then clicking the \"Add Bot\" on the right,\n+and finally then clicking \"Yes, do it!\".\n+> ![Create Bot](https://i.imgur.com/S14iAFS.gif)\n+> `Bot` -> `Add Bot` -> `Yes, do it!`\n+\n+5. Once on this screen, you'll need to uncheck the \"Public Bot\" setting and then click \"Save Changes\",\n+so other people can't add your bot to servers that are not your own.\n+> ![Disable Public Bot](https://i.imgur.com/HHqWvQ1.gif)\n+> Uncheck `Public Bot` -> `Save Changes`\n+\n+6. Finally, you'll need to copy your bot's token and save it for a later step. To copy your bot's token,\n+click the blue \"Copy\" button right of your bot's icon. Make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Copy Token](https://i.imgur.com/OqpaSQH.gif)\n+> `Copy` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+   \n+7. Next up is adding your bot to your discord server. First, goto [essentialsx.net/discord.html](https://essentialsx.net/discord.html)\n+and paste your Client ID you copied from step 2 into the text box on that page. Once you do that, click\n+the \"Authorize\" button next to the text box. This will redirect you to Discord's authorization website \n+to chose which server to add the bot to. Note for advanced users: Please use the `essentialsx.net` website above \n+even if you think you already know how to invite bots. Bots for EssentialsXDiscord require more than just the `bot`\n+scope to work, so please just use the link above even if you think you know what you're doing.\n+> ![OAuth Link Gen](https://i.imgur.com/u6MFJgQ.gif)\n+> Paste Client ID -> `Authorize`\n+\n+8. Once on the Discord authorization website, select the server from the \"Select a server\" dropdown \n+that you want to add the bot to. Then click the \"Authorize\" button. You may be prompted to confirm\n+you are not a bot, proceed with that like you would any other captcha.\n+> ![Authorize](https://i.imgur.com/KXkESqC.gif)\n+> Select Server -> `Authorize`\n+\n+9. For the next few steps, you're going to need to do some stuff in discord, so start up your\n+Discord desktop/web client. \n+\n+10. Once in your Discord client, you'll need to enable developer mode. Do this by going into the \n+Settings, then go to the \"Appearance\" tab and check on the \"Developer Mode\" at the bottom of the\n+page. Once you've checked \"Developer Mode\" on, click the `X` at the top right to exit Settings.\n+> ![Developer Mode](https://i.imgur.com/CrW31Up.gif)\n+> `User Settings` -> `Appearance` -> Check `Developer Mode` -> Exit Settings\n+\n+11. Next is copying a few IDs. First up, you'll want to copy the server (aka guild) id. Do this by\n+finding the server you added the bot to, right click its icon, and click \"Copy ID\". Once you copied\n+it, make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Guild ID](https://i.imgur.com/0mg2yT3.gif)\n+> Right click server -> `Copy ID` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+12. The other ID you need to copy is the ID of the channel you wish to be your primary channel.\n+In other words, this will be the channel that, by default, receives messages for player chat/join/leave/death\n+messages as well as mute/kicks. To see how to further configure message types, see [Configuring Messages](#configuring-messages).\n+> ![Primary Channel ID](https://i.imgur.com/uMODfiQ.gif)\n+> Right click your 'primary' channel -> `Copy ID` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+13. You've successfully copied all the necessary IDs needed for a basic setup. Next up is generating the\n+default config for EssentialsXDiscord, so you can start setting it up! Do this by putting the\n+EssentialsXDiscord jar (you can download it [here](https://essentialsx.net/downloads.html) if you do not\n+already have one) in your plugins folder, starting your server, and then stopping it as soon as it finishes\n+starting up.\n+> ![Start/Stop Server](https://i.imgur.com/JQX6hqM.gif)\n+> Drag EssentialsXDiscord jar into plugins folder -> Start Server -> Stop Server\n+\n+14. Now you can start to configure the plugin with all the stuff you copied from earlier. Open the config\n+for EssentialsXDiscord located at `plugins/EssentialsDiscord/config.yml`. When you open the config, the\n+first thing to configure is your bot's token. Replace `INSERT-TOKEN-HERE` in the config with the token you\n+copied earlier from step 6.\n+> ![Paste Token](https://i.imgur.com/EnD31Wg.gif)\n+> Re-Copy Token from Step 6 -> Paste as token value \n+\n+15. Next, is the guild id, replace the zeros for the guild value in the config with the guild id you copied\n+from step 13.\n+> ![Paste Guild](https://i.imgur.com/YxkHykd.gif)\n+\n+16. Finally, you'll need to paste the primary channel id you copied from step 14 and paste it as the\n+primary value in the channels section and once you've done that save the config file!\n+> ![Paste Primary](https://i.imgur.com/4xaHMfO.gif)\n+\n+17. Congratulations, you've completed the initial setup guide! When you start up your server, you should\n+notice that chat and other messages start showing up in the channel you requested they be. Now that you\n+completed the initial, go back up to the [Table Of Contents](#table-of-contents) to see what other cool things you can do!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Console Relay\n+The console relay is pretty self-explanatory: it relays everything on your console into discord channel of\n+your choosing. The console relay is ridiculously easy to setup and if your server is already running, you don't\n+need to reload it!\n+\n+0. This assumes you've already done the initial setup.\n+\n+1. Go to the discord server that your bot is in and find the channel you wish to use for console output.\n+Right click on the channel and click \"Copy ID\". Save this id for the next step.\n+> ![Copy ID](https://i.imgur.com/qvDfSLv.gif)\n+> Find console channel -> Right Click -> `Copy ID`\n+\n+2. Now that you have that copied, open the EssentialsXDiscord config and find the `console` section. In that\n+section, replace the zeros for the `channel` value with the channel id you copied from the last step. Once\n+you paste it, make sure you save the config.\n+> ![Paste ID](https://i.imgur.com/NicdpGw.gif)\n+\n+3. Finally, if your server is running, run `ess reload` from your console, otherwise start up your server. You\n+should notice console output being directed to that channel! That is all you need if you're okay with the default\n+settings. Otherwise, if you'd like to see what other options you can use to customize console output, stick around.\n+\n+4. The first thing you can customize is the format of the message sent to discord. By default, the timestamp,\n+level (info/warn/error/etc), and message are shown for each console message. Let's say you wanted to make the\n+timestamp and level bold, since this message would be using discord markdown, we can just add \\*\\* to both sides of\n+level and timestamp. Then once you've done that, just do `/ess reload` and you should see your changes on discord.\n+> ![Bold Format](https://i.imgur.com/jD9mH14.gif)\n+\n+5. Next, you can also configure the name you wish the to show above console messages. By default, it's \"EssX Console\n+Relay\" but can be switched to anything you want.\n+> ![Change Name](https://i.imgur.com/xtrt1Jt.gif)\n+\n+6. Finally, you can also choose to enable an option to treat any message by a user in the console channel as a\n+console command. This will mean that anyone who can send messages in your console channel **will be able to execute \n+commands as the console**. It is suggested that you stick to the regular `/execute` command \n+(see [Discord Commands](#discord-commands)) as those can be restricted to specific roles/users and are also not\n+restricted to the console channel.\n+> ![Command Relay](https://i.imgur.com/w3cfVUw.gif)\n+\n+7. That's all the options for the command relay!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Configuring Messages\n+EssentialsXDiscord aims to keep its message-type system basic enough that simple things take little changes, while\n+giving more fine grain control to those you want it.\n+\n+To give you a general overview of the system, EssentialsXDiscord allows you to define different channel IDs in the\n+`channels` section of the config. By default, two channels are pre-populated in the `channels` section, `primary`\n+and `staff`. If you only completed the initial setup, the `staff` channel definition is all zeros. This is fine in\n+most situations however, as the message system will always fallback to the `primary` channel if a channel ID is\n+invalid.\n+\n+Now on the to the types of messages you can receive themselves (which is where you're going to use these channel \n+definitions). In the `message-types` section of the config, you can see a list of message types (join/leave/chat/etc)\n+on the left (as the key), and on the right there is a channel definition.\n+\n+For the sake of example lets say we want to send all chat messages to their own channel. We can do this by creating\n+a new channel definition and setting the `chat` message type to said channel definition. Below are step-by-step \n+instructions for said example, you can follow along to get the gist of how to apply this to other use cases\n+\n+1. Find the channel on discord you want to only send chat messages to and then right click the channel and click\n+\"Copy ID\".\n+> ![Copy ID](https://i.imgur.com/ri7NZkD.gif)\n+\n+2. Next you need to create the actual channel definition, for this example we'll call it `chat`. You create a\n+channel definition by adding a new entry to the `channels` section with the key as its name and the id as the one\n+you copied in the last step.\n+> ![New Def](https://i.imgur.com/dc7kIkl.gif)\n+\n+3. Finally, scroll down to the `message-types` section and change the `chat` message type to your newly created\n+channel definition. Once you do that, save and either run `/ess reload` if your server is running or start your\n+server.\n+> ![Move](https://i.imgur.com/qPVWkWF.gif)\n+\n+4.

First, goto [essentialsx.net/discord.html](https://essentialsx.net/discord.html)\n+and paste your Client ID you copied from step 2 into the text box on that page. Once you do that, click\n+the \"Authorize\" button next to the text box. This will redirect you to Discord's authorization website \n+to chose which server to add the bot to.

For the next few steps, you're going to need to do some stuff in discord, so start up your\n+Discord desktop/web client. \n+\n+10. Once in your Discord client, you'll need to enable developer mode. Do this by going into the \n+Settings, then go to the \"Appearance\" tab and check on the \"Developer Mode\" at the bottom of the\n+page.

You've successfully copied all the necessary IDs needed for a basic setup. Next up is generating the\n+default config for EssentialsXDiscord, so you can start setting it up! Do this by putting the\n+EssentialsXDiscord jar (you can download it [here](https://essentialsx.net/downloads.html) if you do not\n+already have one) in your plugins folder, starting your server, and then stopping it as soon as it finishes\n+starting up.\n+> ![Start/Stop Server](https://i.imgur.com/JQX6hqM.gif)\n+> Drag EssentialsXDiscord jar into plugins folder -> Start Server -> Stop Server\n+\n+14. Now you can start to configure the plugin with all the stuff you copied from earlier. Open the config\n+for EssentialsXDiscord located at `plugins/EssentialsDiscord/config.yml`. When you open the config, the\n+first thing to configure is your bot's token. Replace `INSERT-TOKEN-HERE` in the config with the token you\n+copied earlier from step 6.\n+> ![Paste Token](https://i.imgur.com/EnD31Wg.gif)\n+> Re-Copy Token from Step 6 -> Paste as token value \n+\n+15. Next, is the guild id, replace the zeros for the guild value in the config with the guild id you copied\n+from step 13.\n+> ![Paste Guild](https://i.imgur.com/YxkHykd.gif)\n+\n+16. Finally, you'll need to paste the primary channel id you copied from step 14 and paste it as the\n+primary value in the channels section and once you've done that save the config file!\n+> ![Paste Primary](https://i.imgur.com/4xaHMfO.gif)\n+\n+17. Congratulations, you've completed the initial setup guide! When you start up your server, you should\n+notice that chat and other messages start showing up in the channel you requested they be. Now that you\n+completed the initial, go back up to the [Table Of Contents](#table-of-contents) to see what other cool things you can do!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Console Relay\n+The console relay is pretty self-explanatory: it relays everything on your console into discord channel of\n+your choosing. The console relay is ridiculously easy to setup and if your server is already running, you don't\n+need to reload it!\n+\n+0. This assumes you've already done the initial setup.\n+\n+1. Go to the discord server that your bot is in and find the channel you wish to use for console output.\n+Right click on the channel and click \"Copy ID\". Save this id for the next step.\n+> ![Copy ID](https://i.imgur.com/qvDfSLv.gif)\n+> Find console channel -> Right Click -> `Copy ID`\n+\n+2. Now that you have that copied, open the EssentialsXDiscord config and find the `console` section. In that\n+section, replace the zeros for the `channel` value with the channel id you copied from the last step. Once\n+you paste it, make sure you save the config.\n+> ![Paste ID](https://i.imgur.com/NicdpGw.gif)\n+\n+3. Finally, if your server is running, run `ess reload` from your console, otherwise start up your server. You\n+should notice console output being directed to that channel! That is all you need if you're okay with the default\n+settings. Otherwise, if you'd like to see what other options you can use to customize console output, stick around.\n+\n+4. The first thing you can customize is the format of the message sent to discord. By default, the timestamp,\n+level (info/warn/error/etc), and message are shown for each console message. Let's say you wanted to make the\n+timestamp and level bold, since this message would be using discord markdown, we can just add \\*\\* to both sides of\n+level and timestamp. Then once you've done that, just do `/ess reload` and you should see your changes on discord.\n+> ![Bold Format](https://i.imgur.com/jD9mH14.gif)\n+\n+5. Next, you can also configure the name you wish the to show above console messages. By default, it's \"EssX Console\n+Relay\" but can be switched to anything you want.\n+> ![Change Name](https://i.imgur.com/xtrt1Jt.gif)\n+\n+6. Finally, you can also choose to enable an option to treat any message by a user in the console channel as a\n+console command. This will mean that anyone who can send messages in your console channel **will be able to execute \n+commands as the console**. It is suggested that you stick to the regular `/execute` command \n+(see [Discord Commands](#discord-commands)) as those can be restricted to specific roles/users and are also not\n+restricted to the console channel.\n+> ![Command Relay](https://i.imgur.com/w3cfVUw.gif)\n+\n+7. That's all the options for the command relay!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Configuring Messages\n+EssentialsXDiscord aims to keep its message-type system basic enough that simple things take little changes, while\n+giving more fine grain control to those you want it.\n+\n+To give you a general overview of the system, EssentialsXDiscord allows you to define different channel IDs in the\n+`channels` section of the config. By default, two channels are pre-populated in the `channels` section, `primary`\n+and `staff`. If you only completed the initial setup, the `staff` channel definition is all zeros. This is fine in\n+most situations however, as the message system will always fallback to the `primary` channel if a channel ID is\n+invalid.\n+\n+Now on the to the types of messages you can receive themselves (which is where you're going to use these channel \n+definitions). In the `message-types` section of the config, you can see a list of message types (join/leave/chat/etc)\n+on the left (as the key), and on the right there is a channel definition.\n+\n+For the sake of example lets say we want to send all chat messages to their own channel. We can do this by creating\n+a new channel definition and setting the `chat` message type to said channel definition.

Then once you've done that, just do `/ess reload` and you should see your changes on discord.\n+> ![Bold Format](https://i.imgur.com/jD9mH14.gif)\n+\n+5. Next, you can also configure the name you wish the to show above console messages. By default, it's \"EssX Console\n+Relay\" but can be switched to anything you want.\n+> ![Change Name](https://i.imgur.com/xtrt1Jt.gif)\n+\n+6. Finally, you can also choose to enable an option to treat any message by a user in the console channel as a\n+console command. This will mean that anyone who can send messages in your console channel **will be able to execute \n+commands as the console**. It is suggested that you stick to the regular `/execute` command \n+(see [Discord Commands](#discord-commands)) as those can be restricted to specific roles/users and are also not\n+restricted to the console channel.\n+> ![Command Relay](https://i.imgur.com/w3cfVUw.gif)\n+\n+7. That's all the options for the command relay!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Configuring Messages\n+EssentialsXDiscord aims to keep its message-type system basic enough that simple things take little changes, while\n+giving more fine grain control to those you want it.\n+\n+To give you a general overview of the system, EssentialsXDiscord allows you to define different channel IDs in the\n+`channels` section of the config. By default, two channels are pre-populated in the `channels` section, `primary`\n+and `staff`. If you only completed the initial setup, the `staff` channel definition is all zeros. This is fine in\n+most situations however, as the message system will always fallback to the `primary` channel if a channel ID is\n+invalid.\n+\n+Now on the to the types of messages you can receive themselves (which is where you're going to use these channel \n+definitions). In the `message-types` section of the config, you can see a list of message types (join/leave/chat/etc)\n+on the left (as the key), and on the right there is a channel definition.\n+\n+For the sake of example lets say we want to send all chat messages to their own channel. We can do this by creating\n+a new channel definition and setting the `chat` message type to said channel definition. Below are step-by-step \n+instructions for said example, you can follow along to get the gist of how to apply this to other use cases\n+\n+1. Find the channel on discord you want to only send chat messages to and then right click the channel and click\n+\"Copy ID\".\n+> ![Copy ID](https://i.imgur.com/ri7NZkD.gif)\n+\n+2. Next you need to create the actual channel definition, for this example we'll call it `chat`. You create a\n+channel definition by adding a new entry to the `channels` section with the key as its name and the id as the one\n+you copied in the last step.\n+> ![New Def](https://i.imgur.com/dc7kIkl.gif)\n+\n+3. Finally, scroll down to the `message-types` section and change the `chat` message type to your newly created\n+channel definition.

For the next few steps, you're going to need to do some stuff in discord, so start up your\n+Discord desktop/web client. \n+\n+10. Once in your Discord client, you'll need to enable developer mode. Do this by going into the \n+Settings, then go to the \"Appearance\" tab and check on the \"Developer Mode\" at the bottom of the\n+page. Once you've checked \"Developer Mode\" on, click the `X` at the top right to exit Settings.\n+> ![Developer Mode](https://i.imgur.com/CrW31Up.gif)\n+> `User Settings` -> `Appearance` -> Check `Developer Mode` -> Exit Settings\n+\n+11. Next is copying a few IDs. First up, you'll want to copy the server (aka guild) id. Do this by\n+finding the server you added the bot to, right click its icon, and click \"Copy ID\". Once you copied\n+it, make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Guild ID](https://i.imgur.com/0mg2yT3.gif)\n+> Right click server -> `Copy ID` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+12. The other ID you need to copy is the ID of the channel you wish to be your primary channel.\n+In other words, this will be the channel that, by default, receives messages for player chat/join/leave/death\n+messages as well as mute/kicks. To see how to further configure message types, see [Configuring Messages](#configuring-messages).\n+> ![Primary Channel ID](https://i.imgur.com/uMODfiQ.gif)\n+> Right click your 'primary' channel -> `Copy ID` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+13. You've successfully copied all the necessary IDs needed for a basic setup. Next up is generating the\n+default config for EssentialsXDiscord, so you can start setting it up! Do this by putting the\n+EssentialsXDiscord jar (you can download it [here](https://essentialsx.net/downloads.html) if you do not\n+already have one) in your plugins folder, starting your server, and then stopping it as soon as it finishes\n+starting up.\n+> ![Start/Stop Server](https://i.imgur.com/JQX6hqM.gif)\n+> Drag EssentialsXDiscord jar into plugins folder -> Start Server -> Stop Server\n+\n+14. Now you can start to configure the plugin with all the stuff you copied from earlier. Open the config\n+for EssentialsXDiscord located at `plugins/EssentialsDiscord/config.yml`. When you open the config, the\n+first thing to configure is your bot's token. Replace `INSERT-TOKEN-HERE` in the config with the token you\n+copied earlier from step 6.\n+> ![Paste Token](https://i.imgur.com/EnD31Wg.gif)\n+> Re-Copy Token from Step 6 -> Paste as token value \n+\n+15. Next, is the guild id, replace the zeros for the guild value in the config with the guild id you copied\n+from step 13.\n+> ![Paste Guild](https://i.imgur.com/YxkHykd.gif)\n+\n+16. Finally, you'll need to paste the primary channel id you copied from step 14 and paste it as the\n+primary value in the channels section and once you've done that save the config file!\n+> ![Paste Primary](https://i.imgur.com/4xaHMfO.gif)\n+\n+17. Congratulations, you've completed the initial setup guide! When you start up your server, you should\n+notice that chat and other messages start showing up in the channel you requested they be. Now that you\n+completed the initial, go back up to the [Table Of Contents](#table-of-contents) to see what other cool things you can do!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Console Relay\n+The console relay is pretty self-explanatory: it relays everything on your console into discord channel of\n+your choosing. The console relay is ridiculously easy to setup and if your server is already running, you don't\n+need to reload it!\n+\n+0. This assumes you've already done the initial setup.\n+\n+1. Go to the discord server that your bot is in and find the channel you wish to use for console output.\n+Right click on the channel and click \"Copy ID\". Save this id for the next step.\n+> ![Copy ID](https://i.imgur.com/qvDfSLv.gif)\n+> Find console channel -> Right Click -> `Copy ID`\n+\n+2. Now that you have that copied, open the EssentialsXDiscord config and find the `console` section. In that\n+section, replace the zeros for the `channel` value with the channel id you copied from the last step. Once\n+you paste it, make sure you save the config.\n+> ![Paste ID](https://i.imgur.com/NicdpGw.gif)\n+\n+3. Finally, if your server is running, run `ess reload` from your console, otherwise start up your server. You\n+should notice console output being directed to that channel! That is all you need if you're okay with the default\n+settings. Otherwise, if you'd like to see what other options you can use to customize console output, stick around.\n+\n+4. The first thing you can customize is the format of the message sent to discord. By default, the timestamp,\n+level (info/warn/error/etc), and message are shown for each console message. Let's say you wanted to make the\n+timestamp and level bold, since this message would be using discord markdown, we can just add \\*\\* to both sides of\n+level and timestamp.

Replace `INSERT-TOKEN-HERE` in the config with the token you\n+copied earlier from step 6.\n+> ![Paste Token](https://i.imgur.com/EnD31Wg.gif)\n+> Re-Copy Token from Step 6 -> Paste as token value \n+\n+15. Next, is the guild id, replace the zeros for the guild value in the config with the guild id you copied\n+from step 13.\n+> ![Paste Guild](https://i.imgur.com/YxkHykd.gif)\n+\n+16. Finally, you'll need to paste the primary channel id you copied from step 14 and paste it as the\n+primary value in the channels section and once you've done that save the config file!\n+> ![Paste Primary](https://i.imgur.com/4xaHMfO.gif)\n+\n+17. Congratulations, you've completed the initial setup guide! When you start up your server, you should\n+notice that chat and other messages start showing up in the channel you requested they be. Now that you\n+completed the initial, go back up to the [Table Of Contents](#table-of-contents) to see what other cool things you can do!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Console Relay\n+The console relay is pretty self-explanatory: it relays everything on your console into discord channel of\n+your choosing. The console relay is ridiculously easy to setup and if your server is already running, you don't\n+need to reload it!\n+\n+0. This assumes you've already done the initial setup.\n+\n+1. Go to the discord server that your bot is in and find the channel you wish to use for console output.\n+Right click on the channel and click \"Copy ID\". Save this id for the next step.\n+> ![Copy ID](https://i.imgur.com/qvDfSLv.gif)\n+> Find console channel -> Right Click -> `Copy ID`\n+\n+2. Now that you have that copied, open the EssentialsXDiscord config and find the `console` section. In that\n+section, replace the zeros for the `channel` value with the channel id you copied from the last step. Once\n+you paste it, make sure you save the config.\n+> ![Paste ID](https://i.imgur.com/NicdpGw.gif)\n+\n+3. Finally, if your server is running, run `ess reload` from your console, otherwise start up your server. You\n+should notice console output being directed to that channel! That is all you need if you're okay with the default\n+settings. Otherwise, if you'd like to see what other options you can use to customize console output, stick around.\n+\n+4. The first thing you can customize is the format of the message sent to discord. By default, the timestamp,\n+level (info/warn/error/etc), and message are shown for each console message. Let's say you wanted to make the\n+timestamp and level bold, since this message would be using discord markdown, we can just add \\*\\* to both sides of\n+level and timestamp. Then once you've done that, just do `/ess reload` and you should see your changes on discord.\n+> ![Bold Format](https://i.imgur.com/jD9mH14.gif)\n+\n+5. Next, you can also configure the name you wish the to show above console messages. By default, it's \"EssX Console\n+Relay\" but can be switched to anything you want.\n+> ![Change Name](https://i.imgur.com/xtrt1Jt.gif)\n+\n+6. Finally, you can also choose to enable an option to treat any message by a user in the console channel as a\n+console command. This will mean that anyone who can send messages in your console channel **will be able to execute \n+commands as the console**. It is suggested that you stick to the regular `/execute` command \n+(see [Discord Commands](#discord-commands)) as those can be restricted to specific roles/users and are also not\n+restricted to the console channel.\n+> ![Command Relay](https://i.imgur.com/w3cfVUw.gif)\n+\n+7. That's all the options for the command relay!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Configuring Messages\n+EssentialsXDiscord aims to keep its message-type system basic enough that simple things take little changes, while\n+giving more fine grain control to those you want it.\n+\n+To give you a general overview of the system, EssentialsXDiscord allows you to define different channel IDs in the\n+`channels` section of the config. By default, two channels are pre-populated in the `channels` section, `primary`\n+and `staff`. If you only completed the initial setup, the `staff` channel definition is all zeros. This is fine in\n+most situations however, as the message system will always fallback to the `primary` channel if a channel ID is\n+invalid.\n+\n+Now on the to the types of messages you can receive themselves (which is where you're going to use these channel \n+definitions). In the `message-types` section of the config, you can see a list of message types (join/leave/chat/etc)\n+on the left (as the key), and on the right there is a channel definition.\n+\n+For the sake of example lets say we want to send all chat messages to their own channel. We can do this by creating\n+a new channel definition and setting the `chat` message type to said channel definition. Below are step-by-step \n+instructions for said example, you can follow along to get the gist of how to apply this to other use cases\n+\n+1. Find the channel on discord you want to only send chat messages to and then right click the channel and click\n+\"Copy ID\".\n+> ![Copy ID](https://i.imgur.com/ri7NZkD.gif)\n+\n+2. Next you need to create the actual channel definition, for this example we'll call it `chat`. You create a\n+channel definition by adding a new entry to the `channels` section with the key as its name and the id as the one\n+you copied in the last step.\n+> ![New Def](https://i.imgur.com/dc7kIkl.gif)\n+\n+3. Finally, scroll down to the `message-types` section and change the `chat` message type to your newly created\n+channel definition. Once you do that, save and either run `/ess reload` if your server is running or start your\n+server.\n+> ![Move](https://i.imgur.com/qPVWkWF.gif)\n+\n+4. That's all you need to know about the basics of the message system!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Receive Discord Messages in Minecraft\n+After reading the [configuring messages section](#configuring-messages), you should now have a few discord\n+channels defined in the `channels` of your config. You're probably wondering how you can let your players start\n+to see messages from discord in minecraft chat. Say I defined a channel named `chat` in the `channels` section\n+of your config, and I wanted to let players see discord messages from that channel in minecraft chat; This can\n+be accomplished very simply by giving players the `essentials.discord.receive.chat` permission. This would relay\n+all discord messages from the `chat` channel to players with that permission. Another example: say I have a staff\n+channel in discord that I want only staff members in the minecraft server to see. Provided there is a `staff`\n+channel defined in the `channels` section of the config, I can give staff members the\n+`essentials.discord.receive.staff` permission, and they will start to see messages from that channel.\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Discord Commands\n+EssentialsXDiscord uses Discord's slash command system to let you type commands into discord without it being", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "99a4b3ab018d821d7dc3e6713b3099f05db6ff73"}, "originalPosition": 222}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkNDE4NjY4NDk5OnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "EssentialsDiscord/README.md", "isResolved": true, "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMS0wNi0yNlQyMjowNzo1M1rOJ0sJmw==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMS0wNi0yNlQyMjowNzo1M1rOJ0sJmw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDY1OTIyOTA4Mw==", "bodyText": "This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

Before starting your server, there are a few steps you have to take. First, you must create a new\n+discord bot at [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).\n+\n+1. Once on that page, click on \"New Application\" button on the top right, give your bot a name, and\n+then click \"Create\".\n+> ![Creating Application](https://i.imgur.com/8ffp4R1.gif)\n+> `New Application` -> Give Application a Name -> `Create`\n+\n+2. Once you create the application, you'll be directed to its overview. From this screen, you'll\n+need to copy your \"Client ID\" and save it for a later step. To copy your client id, click the\n+upper-left most blue \"Copy\" button. Make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Copy Client ID](https://i.imgur.com/W3OMTu5.gif)\n+> `Copy` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+3. Optionally, you can set an icon for your application as it will be the icon for the bot too.\n+> ![Avatar](https://i.imgur.com/NuFS9kT.png)\n+\n+4. The next step is actually creating a bot user for your application. From the overview screen,\n+this is done by going to the \"Bot\" tab on the left, then clicking the \"Add Bot\" on the right,\n+and finally then clicking \"Yes, do it!\".\n+> ![Create Bot](https://i.imgur.com/S14iAFS.gif)\n+> `Bot` -> `Add Bot` -> `Yes, do it!`\n+\n+5. Once on this screen, you'll need to uncheck the \"Public Bot\" setting and then click \"Save Changes\",\n+so other people can't add your bot to servers that are not your own.\n+> ![Disable Public Bot](https://i.imgur.com/HHqWvQ1.gif)\n+> Uncheck `Public Bot` -> `Save Changes`\n+\n+6. Finally, you'll need to copy your bot's token and save it for a later step. To copy your bot's token,\n+click the blue \"Copy\" button right of your bot's icon. Make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Copy Token](https://i.imgur.com/OqpaSQH.gif)\n+> `Copy` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+   \n+7. Next up is adding your bot to your discord server. First, goto [essentialsx.net/discord.html](https://essentialsx.net/discord.html)\n+and paste your Client ID you copied from step 2 into the text box on that page. Once you do that, click\n+the \"Authorize\" button next to the text box. This will redirect you to Discord's authorization website \n+to chose which server to add the bot to. Note for advanced users: Please use the `essentialsx.net` website above \n+even if you think you already know how to invite bots. Bots for EssentialsXDiscord require more than just the `bot`\n+scope to work, so please just use the link above even if you think you know what you're doing.\n+> ![OAuth Link Gen](https://i.imgur.com/u6MFJgQ.gif)\n+> Paste Client ID -> `Authorize`\n+\n+8. Once on the Discord authorization website, select the server from the \"Select a server\" dropdown \n+that you want to add the bot to. Then click the \"Authorize\" button. You may be prompted to confirm\n+you are not a bot, proceed with that like you would any other captcha.\n+> ![Authorize](https://i.imgur.com/KXkESqC.gif)\n+> Select Server -> `Authorize`\n+\n+9. For the next few steps, you're going to need to do some stuff in discord, so start up your\n+Discord desktop/web client. \n+\n+10. Once in your Discord client, you'll need to enable developer mode. Do this by going into the \n+Settings, then go to the \"Appearance\" tab and check on the \"Developer Mode\" at the bottom of the\n+page. Once you've checked \"Developer Mode\" on, click the `X` at the top right to exit Settings.\n+> ![Developer Mode](https://i.imgur.com/CrW31Up.gif)\n+> `User Settings` -> `Appearance` -> Check `Developer Mode` -> Exit Settings\n+\n+11. Next is copying a few IDs. First up, you'll want to copy the server (aka guild) id. Do this by\n+finding the server you added the bot to, right click its icon, and click \"Copy ID\". Once you copied\n+it, make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Guild ID](https://i.imgur.com/0mg2yT3.gif)\n+> Right click server -> `Copy ID` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+12. The other ID you need to copy is the ID of the channel you wish to be your primary channel.\n+In other words, this will be the channel that, by default, receives messages for player chat/join/leave/death\n+messages as well as mute/kicks. To see how to further configure message types, see [Configuring Messages](#configuring-messages).\n+> ![Primary Channel ID](https://i.imgur.com/uMODfiQ.gif)\n+> Right click your 'primary' channel -> `Copy ID` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+13. You've successfully copied all the necessary IDs needed for a basic setup. Next up is generating the\n+default config for EssentialsXDiscord, so you can start setting it up! Do this by putting the\n+EssentialsXDiscord jar (you can download it [here](https://essentialsx.net/downloads.html) if you do not\n+already have one) in your plugins folder, starting your server, and then stopping it as soon as it finishes\n+starting up.\n+> ![Start/Stop Server](https://i.imgur.com/JQX6hqM.gif)\n+> Drag EssentialsXDiscord jar into plugins folder -> Start Server -> Stop Server\n+\n+14. Now you can start to configure the plugin with all the stuff you copied from earlier. Open the config\n+for EssentialsXDiscord located at `plugins/EssentialsDiscord/config.yml`. When you open the config, the\n+first thing to configure is your bot's token. Replace `INSERT-TOKEN-HERE` in the config with the token you\n+copied earlier from step 6.\n+> ![Paste Token](https://i.imgur.com/EnD31Wg.gif)\n+> Re-Copy Token from Step 6 -> Paste as token value \n+\n+15. Next, is the guild id, replace the zeros for the guild value in the config with the guild id you copied\n+from step 13.\n+> ![Paste Guild](https://i.imgur.com/YxkHykd.gif)\n+\n+16. Finally, you'll need to paste the primary channel id you copied from step 14 and paste it as the\n+primary value in the channels section and once you've done that save the config file!\n+> ![Paste Primary](https://i.imgur.com/4xaHMfO.gif)\n+\n+17.

From the overview screen,\n+this is done by going to the \"Bot\" tab on the left, then clicking the \"Add Bot\" on the right,\n+and finally then clicking \"Yes, do it!\".\n+> ![Create Bot](https://i.imgur.com/S14iAFS.gif)\n+> `Bot` -> `Add Bot` -> `Yes, do it!`\n+\n+5. Once on this screen, you'll need to uncheck the \"Public Bot\" setting and then click \"Save Changes\",\n+so other people can't add your bot to servers that are not your own.\n+> ![Disable Public Bot](https://i.imgur.com/HHqWvQ1.gif)\n+> Uncheck `Public Bot` -> `Save Changes`\n+\n+6. Finally, you'll need to copy your bot's token and save it for a later step. To copy your bot's token,\n+click the blue \"Copy\" button right of your bot's icon. Make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Copy Token](https://i.imgur.com/OqpaSQH.gif)\n+> `Copy` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+   \n+7. Next up is adding your bot to your discord server. First, goto [essentialsx.net/discord.html](https://essentialsx.net/discord.html)\n+and paste your Client ID you copied from step 2 into the text box on that page. Once you do that, click\n+the \"Authorize\" button next to the text box. This will redirect you to Discord's authorization website \n+to chose which server to add the bot to. Note for advanced users: Please use the `essentialsx.net` website above \n+even if you think you already know how to invite bots. Bots for EssentialsXDiscord require more than just the `bot`\n+scope to work, so please just use the link above even if you think you know what you're doing.\n+> ![OAuth Link Gen](https://i.imgur.com/u6MFJgQ.gif)\n+> Paste Client ID -> `Authorize`\n+\n+8. Once on the Discord authorization website, select the server from the \"Select a server\" dropdown \n+that you want to add the bot to. Then click the \"Authorize\" button. You may be prompted to confirm\n+you are not a bot, proceed with that like you would any other captcha.\n+> ![Authorize](https://i.imgur.com/KXkESqC.gif)\n+> Select Server -> `Authorize`\n+\n+9. For the next few steps, you're going to need to do some stuff in discord, so start up your\n+Discord desktop/web client. \n+\n+10. Once in your Discord client, you'll need to enable developer mode. Do this by going into the \n+Settings, then go to the \"Appearance\" tab and check on the \"Developer Mode\" at the bottom of the\n+page. Once you've checked \"Developer Mode\" on, click the `X` at the top right to exit Settings.\n+> ![Developer Mode](https://i.imgur.com/CrW31Up.gif)\n+> `User Settings` -> `Appearance` -> Check `Developer Mode` -> Exit Settings\n+\n+11. Next is copying a few IDs. First up, you'll want to copy the server (aka guild) id. Do this by\n+finding the server you added the bot to, right click its icon, and click \"Copy ID\". Once you copied\n+it, make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Guild ID](https://i.imgur.com/0mg2yT3.gif)\n+> Right click server -> `Copy ID` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+12. The other ID you need to copy is the ID of the channel you wish to be your primary channel.\n+In other words, this will be the channel that, by default, receives messages for player chat/join/leave/death\n+messages as well as mute/kicks. To see how to further configure message types, see [Configuring Messages](#configuring-messages).\n+> ![Primary Channel ID](https://i.imgur.com/uMODfiQ.gif)\n+> Right click your 'primary' channel -> `Copy ID` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+13. You've successfully copied all the necessary IDs needed for a basic setup. Next up is generating the\n+default config for EssentialsXDiscord, so you can start setting it up! Do this by putting the\n+EssentialsXDiscord jar (you can download it [here](https://essentialsx.net/downloads.html) if you do not\n+already have one) in your plugins folder, starting your server, and then stopping it as soon as it finishes\n+starting up.\n+> ![Start/Stop Server](https://i.imgur.com/JQX6hqM.gif)\n+> Drag EssentialsXDiscord jar into plugins folder -> Start Server -> Stop Server\n+\n+14. Now you can start to configure the plugin with all the stuff you copied from earlier. Open the config\n+for EssentialsXDiscord located at `plugins/EssentialsDiscord/config.yml`. When you open the config, the\n+first thing to configure is your bot's token. Replace `INSERT-TOKEN-HERE` in the config with the token you\n+copied earlier from step 6.\n+> ![Paste Token](https://i.imgur.com/EnD31Wg.gif)\n+> Re-Copy Token from Step 6 -> Paste as token value \n+\n+15. Next, is the guild id, replace the zeros for the guild value in the config with the guild id you copied\n+from step 13.\n+> ![Paste Guild](https://i.imgur.com/YxkHykd.gif)\n+\n+16. Finally, you'll need to paste the primary channel id you copied from step 14 and paste it as the\n+primary value in the channels section and once you've done that save the config file!\n+> ![Paste Primary](https://i.imgur.com/4xaHMfO.gif)\n+\n+17. Congratulations, you've completed the initial setup guide! When you start up your server, you should\n+notice that chat and other messages start showing up in the channel you requested they be. Now that you\n+completed the initial, go back up to the [Table Of Contents](#table-of-contents) to see what other cool things you can do!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Console Relay\n+The console relay is pretty self-explanatory: it relays everything on your console into discord channel of\n+your choosing. The console relay is ridiculously easy to setup and if your server is already running, you don't\n+need to reload it!\n+\n+0. This assumes you've already done the initial setup.\n+\n+1. Go to the discord server that your bot is in and find the channel you wish to use for console output.\n+Right click on the channel and click \"Copy ID\". Save this id for the next step.\n+> ![Copy ID](https://i.imgur.com/qvDfSLv.gif)\n+> Find console channel -> Right Click -> `Copy ID`\n+\n+2. Now that you have that copied, open the EssentialsXDiscord config and find the `console` section. In that\n+section, replace the zeros for the `channel` value with the channel id you copied from the last step. Once\n+you paste it, make sure you save the config.\n+> ![Paste ID](https://i.imgur.com/NicdpGw.gif)\n+\n+3. Finally, if your server is running, run `ess reload` from your console, otherwise start up your server. You\n+should notice console output being directed to that channel! That is all you need if you're okay with the default\n+settings. Otherwise, if you'd like to see what other options you can use to customize console output, stick around.\n+\n+4. The first thing you can customize is the format of the message sent to discord. By default, the timestamp,\n+level (info/warn/error/etc), and message are shown for each console message. Let's say you wanted to make the\n+timestamp and level bold, since this message would be using discord markdown, we can just add \\*\\* to both sides of\n+level and timestamp. Then once you've done that, just do `/ess reload` and you should see your changes on discord.\n+> ![Bold Format](https://i.imgur.com/jD9mH14.gif)\n+\n+5. Next, you can also configure the name you wish the to show above console messages. By default, it's \"EssX Console\n+Relay\" but can be switched to anything you want.\n+> ![Change Name](https://i.imgur.com/xtrt1Jt.gif)\n+\n+6. Finally, you can also choose to enable an option to treat any message by a user in the console channel as a\n+console command. This will mean that anyone who can send messages in your console channel **will be able to execute \n+commands as the console**. It is suggested that you stick to the regular `/execute` command \n+(see [Discord Commands](#discord-commands)) as those can be restricted to specific roles/users and are also not\n+restricted to the console channel.\n+> ![Command Relay](https://i.imgur.com/w3cfVUw.gif)\n+\n+7. That's all the options for the command relay!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Configuring Messages\n+EssentialsXDiscord aims to keep its message-type system basic enough that simple things take little changes, while\n+giving more fine grain control to those you want it.\n+\n+To give you a general overview of the system, EssentialsXDiscord allows you to define different channel IDs in the\n+`channels` section of the config. By default, two channels are pre-populated in the `channels` section, `primary`\n+and `staff`. If you only completed the initial setup, the `staff` channel definition is all zeros. This is fine in\n+most situations however, as the message system will always fallback to the `primary` channel if a channel ID is\n+invalid.\n+\n+Now on the to the types of messages you can receive themselves (which is where you're going to use these channel \n+definitions). In the `message-types` section of the config, you can see a list of message types (join/leave/chat/etc)\n+on the left (as the key), and on the right there is a channel definition.\n+\n+For the sake of example lets say we want to send all chat messages to their own channel. We can do this by creating\n+a new channel definition and setting the `chat` message type to said channel definition. Below are step-by-step \n+instructions for said example, you can follow along to get the gist of how to apply this to other use cases\n+\n+1. Find the channel on discord you want to only send chat messages to and then right click the channel and click\n+\"Copy ID\".\n+> ![Copy ID](https://i.imgur.com/ri7NZkD.gif)\n+\n+2. Next you need to create the actual channel definition, for this example we'll call it `chat`. You create a\n+channel definition by adding a new entry to the `channels` section with the key as its name and the id as the one\n+you copied in the last step.\n+> ![New Def](https://i.imgur.com/dc7kIkl.gif)\n+\n+3. Finally, scroll down to the `message-types` section and change the `chat` message type to your newly created\n+channel definition. Once you do that, save and either run `/ess reload` if your server is running or start your\n+server.\n+> ![Move](https://i.imgur.com/qPVWkWF.gif)\n+\n+4. That's all you need to know about the basics of the message system!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Receive Discord Messages in Minecraft\n+After reading the [configuring messages section](#configuring-messages), you should now have a few discord\n+channels defined in the `channels` of your config. You're probably wondering how you can let your players start\n+to see messages from discord in minecraft chat. Say I defined a channel named `chat` in the `channels` section\n+of your config, and I wanted to let players see discord messages from that channel in minecraft chat; This can\n+be accomplished very simply by giving players the `essentials.discord.receive.chat` permission. This would relay\n+all discord messages from the `chat` channel to players with that permission. Another example: say I have a staff\n+channel in discord that I want only staff members in the minecraft server to see. Provided there is a `staff`\n+channel defined in the `channels` section of the config, I can give staff members the\n+`essentials.discord.receive.staff` permission, and they will start to see messages from that channel.\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Discord Commands\n+EssentialsXDiscord uses Discord's slash command system to let you type commands into discord without it being\n+seen by other people in the server. With this system, you are able to execute console commands, message players,\n+and see the current player list.\n+\n+For example, here's what the `/execute` command looks like by default:\n+> ![/execute](https://i.imgur.com/yPN22bV.gif)\n+\n+As you can see, you can seamlessly run commands without people seeing the content of your commands or their\n+response. Additionally, you can also delete the responses once you're done looking at them, so they don't clutter\n+your chat.\n+\n+However, this is all configurable! In the `commands` section of the config, lies a ton of options to configure\n+settings on a per-command basis. Below are explanations of what all the configuration options mean and how to use\n+them.\n+\n+* `enabled`\n+  * Default: `true`\n+  * Description: `Whether or not the command should be enabled and therefore shown on discord. Note that you\n+    must restart your minecraft server before this option takes effect.`\n+* `hide-command`\n+  * Default: `true`\n+  * Description: `Whether other people should not be able to see what commands you execute. Setting to false\n+    would allow people in the same channel as you to see exactly what command you execute. In the example below,\n+    you can see how disabling this option shows a message of the user and the command they executed.`\n+  * Example: ![Show Command](https://i.imgur.com/Q61iP4n.gif)\n+* `allowed-roles`\n+  * Description: `A list of user ids or role names/ids that are allowed to use the command.

Provided there is a `staff`\n+channel defined in the `channels` section of the config, I can give staff members the\n+`essentials.discord.receive.staff` permission, and they will start to see messages from that channel.\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Discord Commands\n+EssentialsXDiscord uses Discord's slash command system to let you type commands into discord without it being\n+seen by other people in the server. With this system, you are able to execute console commands, message players,\n+and see the current player list.\n+\n+For example, here's what the `/execute` command looks like by default:\n+> ![/execute](https://i.imgur.com/yPN22bV.gif)\n+\n+As you can see, you can seamlessly run commands without people seeing the content of your commands or their\n+response. Additionally, you can also delete the responses once you're done looking at them, so they don't clutter\n+your chat.\n+\n+However, this is all configurable! In the `commands` section of the config, lies a ton of options to configure\n+settings on a per-command basis. Below are explanations of what all the configuration options mean and how to use\n+them.\n+\n+* `enabled`\n+  * Default: `true`\n+  * Description: `Whether or not the command should be enabled and therefore shown on discord. Note that you\n+    must restart your minecraft server before this option takes effect.`\n+* `hide-command`\n+  * Default: `true`\n+  * Description: `Whether other people should not be able to see what commands you execute. Setting to false\n+    would allow people in the same channel as you to see exactly what command you execute. In the example below,\n+    you can see how disabling this option shows a message of the user and the command they executed.`\n+  * Example: ![Show Command](https://i.imgur.com/Q61iP4n.gif)\n+* `allowed-roles`\n+  * Description: `A list of user ids or role names/ids that are allowed to use the command. You can also use '*'\n+    in order to allow everyone to use the command.`\n+* `admin-roles`\n+  * `A list of user ids or role names/ids that have extra features in the command.

Before starting your server, there are a few steps you have to take. First, you must create a new\n+discord bot at [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).\n+\n+1. Once on that page, click on \"New Application\" button on the top right, give your bot a name, and\n+then click \"Create\".\n+> ![Creating Application](https://i.imgur.com/8ffp4R1.gif)\n+> `New Application` -> Give Application a Name -> `Create`\n+\n+2. Once you create the application, you'll be directed to its overview. From this screen, you'll\n+need to copy your \"Client ID\" and save it for a later step. To copy your client id, click the\n+upper-left most blue \"Copy\" button. Make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Copy Client ID](https://i.imgur.com/W3OMTu5.gif)\n+> `Copy` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+3. Optionally, you can set an icon for your application as it will be the icon for the bot too.\n+> ![Avatar](https://i.imgur.com/NuFS9kT.png)\n+\n+4. The next step is actually creating a bot user for your application. From the overview screen,\n+this is done by going to the \"Bot\" tab on the left, then clicking the \"Add Bot\" on the right,\n+and finally then clicking \"Yes, do it!\".\n+> ![Create Bot](https://i.imgur.com/S14iAFS.gif)\n+> `Bot` -> `Add Bot` -> `Yes, do it!`\n+\n+5. Once on this screen, you'll need to uncheck the \"Public Bot\" setting and then click \"Save Changes\",\n+so other people can't add your bot to servers that are not your own.\n+> ![Disable Public Bot](https://i.imgur.com/HHqWvQ1.gif)\n+> Uncheck `Public Bot` -> `Save Changes`\n+\n+6. Finally, you'll need to copy your bot's token and save it for a later step. To copy your bot's token,\n+click the blue \"Copy\" button right of your bot's icon. Make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Copy Token](https://i.imgur.com/OqpaSQH.gif)\n+> `Copy` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+   \n+7. Next up is adding your bot to your discord server. First, goto [essentialsx.net/discord.html](https://essentialsx.net/discord.html)\n+and paste your Client ID you copied from step 2 into the text box on that page. Once you do that, click\n+the \"Authorize\" button next to the text box. This will redirect you to Discord's authorization website \n+to chose which server to add the bot to. Note for advanced users: Please use the `essentialsx.net` website above \n+even if you think you already know how to invite bots. Bots for EssentialsXDiscord require more than just the `bot`\n+scope to work, so please just use the link above even if you think you know what you're doing.\n+> ![OAuth Link Gen](https://i.imgur.com/u6MFJgQ.gif)\n+> Paste Client ID -> `Authorize`\n+\n+8. Once on the Discord authorization website, select the server from the \"Select a server\" dropdown \n+that you want to add the bot to. Then click the \"Authorize\" button. You may be prompted to confirm\n+you are not a bot, proceed with that like you would any other captcha.\n+> ![Authorize](https://i.imgur.com/KXkESqC.gif)\n+> Select Server -> `Authorize`\n+\n+9. For the next few steps, you're going to need to do some stuff in discord, so start up your\n+Discord desktop/web client. \n+\n+10. Once in your Discord client, you'll need to enable developer mode. Do this by going into the \n+Settings, then go to the \"Appearance\" tab and check on the \"Developer Mode\" at the bottom of the\n+page. Once you've checked \"Developer Mode\" on, click the `X` at the top right to exit Settings.\n+> ![Developer Mode](https://i.imgur.com/CrW31Up.gif)\n+> `User Settings` -> `Appearance` -> Check `Developer Mode` -> Exit Settings\n+\n+11. Next is copying a few IDs. First up, you'll want to copy the server (aka guild) id. Do this by\n+finding the server you added the bot to, right click its icon, and click \"Copy ID\". Once you copied\n+it, make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Guild ID](https://i.imgur.com/0mg2yT3.gif)\n+> Right click server -> `Copy ID` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+12. The other ID you need to copy is the ID of the channel you wish to be your primary channel.\n+In other words, this will be the channel that, by default, receives messages for player chat/join/leave/death\n+messages as well as mute/kicks. To see how to further configure message types, see [Configuring Messages](#configuring-messages).\n+> ![Primary Channel ID](https://i.imgur.com/uMODfiQ.gif)\n+> Right click your 'primary' channel -> `Copy ID` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+13. You've successfully copied all the necessary IDs needed for a basic setup. Next up is generating the\n+default config for EssentialsXDiscord, so you can start setting it up! Do this by putting the\n+EssentialsXDiscord jar (you can download it [here](https://essentialsx.net/downloads.html) if you do not\n+already have one) in your plugins folder, starting your server, and then stopping it as soon as it finishes\n+starting up.\n+> ![Start/Stop Server](https://i.imgur.com/JQX6hqM.gif)\n+> Drag EssentialsXDiscord jar into plugins folder -> Start Server -> Stop Server\n+\n+14. Now you can start to configure the plugin with all the stuff you copied from earlier. Open the config\n+for EssentialsXDiscord located at `plugins/EssentialsDiscord/config.yml`. When you open the config, the\n+first thing to configure is your bot's token. Replace `INSERT-TOKEN-HERE` in the config with the token you\n+copied earlier from step 6.\n+> ![Paste Token](https://i.imgur.com/EnD31Wg.gif)\n+> Re-Copy Token from Step 6 -> Paste as token value \n+\n+15. Next, is the guild id, replace the zeros for the guild value in the config with the guild id you copied\n+from step 13.\n+> ![Paste Guild](https://i.imgur.com/YxkHykd.gif)\n+\n+16. Finally, you'll need to paste the primary channel id you copied from step 14 and paste it as the\n+primary value in the channels section and once you've done that save the config file!\n+> ![Paste Primary](https://i.imgur.com/4xaHMfO.gif)\n+\n+17. Congratulations, you've completed the initial setup guide! When you start up your server, you should\n+notice that chat and other messages start showing up in the channel you requested they be. Now that you\n+completed the initial, go back up to the [Table Of Contents](#table-of-contents) to see what other cool things you can do!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Console Relay\n+The console relay is pretty self-explanatory: it relays everything on your console into discord channel of\n+your choosing. The console relay is ridiculously easy to setup and if your server is already running, you don't\n+need to reload it!\n+\n+0. This assumes you've already done the initial setup.\n+\n+1. Go to the discord server that your bot is in and find the channel you wish to use for console output.\n+Right click on the channel and click \"Copy ID\". Save this id for the next step.\n+> ![Copy ID](https://i.imgur.com/qvDfSLv.gif)\n+> Find console channel -> Right Click -> `Copy ID`\n+\n+2. Now that you have that copied, open the EssentialsXDiscord config and find the `console` section. In that\n+section, replace the zeros for the `channel` value with the channel id you copied from the last step. Once\n+you paste it, make sure you save the config.\n+> ![Paste ID](https://i.imgur.com/NicdpGw.gif)\n+\n+3. Finally, if your server is running, run `ess reload` from your console, otherwise start up your server. You\n+should notice console output being directed to that channel! That is all you need if you're okay with the default\n+settings. Otherwise, if you'd like to see what other options you can use to customize console output, stick around.\n+\n+4. The first thing you can customize is the format of the message sent to discord. By default, the timestamp,\n+level (info/warn/error/etc), and message are shown for each console message. Let's say you wanted to make the\n+timestamp and level bold, since this message would be using discord markdown, we can just add \\*\\* to both sides of\n+level and timestamp. Then once you've done that, just do `/ess reload` and you should see your changes on discord.\n+> ![Bold Format](https://i.imgur.com/jD9mH14.gif)\n+\n+5. Next, you can also configure the name you wish the to show above console messages. By default, it's \"EssX Console\n+Relay\" but can be switched to anything you want.\n+> ![Change Name](https://i.imgur.com/xtrt1Jt.gif)\n+\n+6. Finally, you can also choose to enable an option to treat any message by a user in the console channel as a\n+console command. This will mean that anyone who can send messages in your console channel **will be able to execute \n+commands as the console**. It is suggested that you stick to the regular `/execute` command \n+(see [Discord Commands](#discord-commands)) as those can be restricted to specific roles/users and are also not\n+restricted to the console channel.\n+> ![Command Relay](https://i.imgur.com/w3cfVUw.gif)\n+\n+7. That's all the options for the command relay!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Configuring Messages\n+EssentialsXDiscord aims to keep its message-type system basic enough that simple things take little changes, while\n+giving more fine grain control to those you want it.\n+\n+To give you a general overview of the system, EssentialsXDiscord allows you to define different channel IDs in the\n+`channels` section of the config. By default, two channels are pre-populated in the `channels` section, `primary`\n+and `staff`. If you only completed the initial setup, the `staff` channel definition is all zeros. This is fine in\n+most situations however, as the message system will always fallback to the `primary` channel if a channel ID is\n+invalid.\n+\n+Now on the to the types of messages you can receive themselves (which is where you're going to use these channel \n+definitions). In the `message-types` section of the config, you can see a list of message types (join/leave/chat/etc)\n+on the left (as the key), and on the right there is a channel definition.\n+\n+For the sake of example lets say we want to send all chat messages to their own channel. We can do this by creating\n+a new channel definition and setting the `chat` message type to said channel definition. Below are step-by-step \n+instructions for said example, you can follow along to get the gist of how to apply this to other use cases\n+\n+1. Find the channel on discord you want to only send chat messages to and then right click the channel and click\n+\"Copy ID\".\n+> ![Copy ID](https://i.imgur.com/ri7NZkD.gif)\n+\n+2. Next you need to create the actual channel definition, for this example we'll call it `chat`. You create a\n+channel definition by adding a new entry to the `channels` section with the key as its name and the id as the one\n+you copied in the last step.\n+> ![New Def](https://i.imgur.com/dc7kIkl.gif)\n+\n+3. Finally, scroll down to the `message-types` section and change the `chat` message type to your newly created\n+channel definition. Once you do that, save and either run `/ess reload` if your server is running or start your\n+server.\n+> ![Move](https://i.imgur.com/qPVWkWF.gif)\n+\n+4. That's all you need to know about the basics of the message system!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Receive Discord Messages in Minecraft\n+After reading the [configuring messages section](#configuring-messages), you should now have a few discord\n+channels defined in the `channels` of your config. You're probably wondering how you can let your players start\n+to see messages from discord in minecraft chat. Say I defined a channel named `chat` in the `channels` section\n+of your config, and I wanted to let players see discord messages from that channel in minecraft chat; This can\n+be accomplished very simply by giving players the `essentials.discord.receive.chat` permission. This would relay\n+all discord messages from the `chat` channel to players with that permission. Another example: say I have a staff\n+channel in discord that I want only staff members in the minecraft server to see. Provided there is a `staff`\n+channel defined in the `channels` section of the config, I can give staff members the\n+`essentials.discord.receive.staff` permission, and they will start to see messages from that channel.\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Discord Commands\n+EssentialsXDiscord uses Discord's slash command system to let you type commands into discord without it being\n+seen by other people in the server. With this system, you are able to execute console commands, message players,\n+and see the current player list.\n+\n+For example, here's what the `/execute` command looks like by default:\n+> ![/execute](https://i.imgur.com/yPN22bV.gif)\n+\n+As you can see, you can seamlessly run commands without people seeing the content of your commands or their\n+response. Additionally, you can also delete the responses once you're done looking at them, so they don't clutter\n+your chat.\n+\n+However, this is all configurable! In the `commands` section of the config, lies a ton of options to configure\n+settings on a per-command basis. Below are explanations of what all the configuration options mean and how to use\n+them.\n+\n+* `enabled`\n+  * Default: `true`\n+  * Description: `Whether or not the command should be enabled and therefore shown on discord.

Replace `INSERT-TOKEN-HERE` in the config with the token you\n+copied earlier from step 6.\n+> ![Paste Token](https://i.imgur.com/EnD31Wg.gif)\n+> Re-Copy Token from Step 6 -> Paste as token value \n+\n+15. Next, is the guild id, replace the zeros for the guild value in the config with the guild id you copied\n+from step 13.\n+> ![Paste Guild](https://i.imgur.com/YxkHykd.gif)\n+\n+16. Finally, you'll need to paste the primary channel id you copied from step 14 and paste it as the\n+primary value in the channels section and once you've done that save the config file!\n+> ![Paste Primary](https://i.imgur.com/4xaHMfO.gif)\n+\n+17. Congratulations, you've completed the initial setup guide! When you start up your server, you should\n+notice that chat and other messages start showing up in the channel you requested they be. Now that you\n+completed the initial, go back up to the [Table Of Contents](#table-of-contents) to see what other cool things you can do!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Console Relay\n+The console relay is pretty self-explanatory: it relays everything on your console into discord channel of\n+your choosing. The console relay is ridiculously easy to setup and if your server is already running, you don't\n+need to reload it!\n+\n+0. This assumes you've already done the initial setup.\n+\n+1. Go to the discord server that your bot is in and find the channel you wish to use for console output.\n+Right click on the channel and click \"Copy ID\". Save this id for the next step.\n+> ![Copy ID](https://i.imgur.com/qvDfSLv.gif)\n+> Find console channel -> Right Click -> `Copy ID`\n+\n+2. Now that you have that copied, open the EssentialsXDiscord config and find the `console` section. In that\n+section, replace the zeros for the `channel` value with the channel id you copied from the last step. Once\n+you paste it, make sure you save the config.\n+> ![Paste ID](https://i.imgur.com/NicdpGw.gif)\n+\n+3. Finally, if your server is running, run `ess reload` from your console, otherwise start up your server. You\n+should notice console output being directed to that channel! That is all you need if you're okay with the default\n+settings. Otherwise, if you'd like to see what other options you can use to customize console output, stick around.\n+\n+4. The first thing you can customize is the format of the message sent to discord. By default, the timestamp,\n+level (info/warn/error/etc), and message are shown for each console message. Let's say you wanted to make the\n+timestamp and level bold, since this message would be using discord markdown, we can just add \\*\\* to both sides of\n+level and timestamp. Then once you've done that, just do `/ess reload` and you should see your changes on discord.\n+> ![Bold Format](https://i.imgur.com/jD9mH14.gif)\n+\n+5. Next, you can also configure the name you wish the to show above console messages. By default, it's \"EssX Console\n+Relay\" but can be switched to anything you want.\n+> ![Change Name](https://i.imgur.com/xtrt1Jt.gif)\n+\n+6. Finally, you can also choose to enable an option to treat any message by a user in the console channel as a\n+console command. This will mean that anyone who can send messages in your console channel **will be able to execute \n+commands as the console**. It is suggested that you stick to the regular `/execute` command \n+(see [Discord Commands](#discord-commands)) as those can be restricted to specific roles/users and are also not\n+restricted to the console channel.\n+> ![Command Relay](https://i.imgur.com/w3cfVUw.gif)\n+\n+7. That's all the options for the command relay!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Configuring Messages\n+EssentialsXDiscord aims to keep its message-type system basic enough that simple things take little changes, while\n+giving more fine grain control to those you want it.\n+\n+To give you a general overview of the system, EssentialsXDiscord allows you to define different channel IDs in the\n+`channels` section of the config. By default, two channels are pre-populated in the `channels` section, `primary`\n+and `staff`. If you only completed the initial setup, the `staff` channel definition is all zeros. This is fine in\n+most situations however, as the message system will always fallback to the `primary` channel if a channel ID is\n+invalid.\n+\n+Now on the to the types of messages you can receive themselves (which is where you're going to use these channel \n+definitions). In the `message-types` section of the config, you can see a list of message types (join/leave/chat/etc)\n+on the left (as the key), and on the right there is a channel definition.\n+\n+For the sake of example lets say we want to send all chat messages to their own channel. We can do this by creating\n+a new channel definition and setting the `chat` message type to said channel definition. Below are step-by-step \n+instructions for said example, you can follow along to get the gist of how to apply this to other use cases\n+\n+1. Find the channel on discord you want to only send chat messages to and then right click the channel and click\n+\"Copy ID\".\n+> ![Copy ID](https://i.imgur.com/ri7NZkD.gif)\n+\n+2. Next you need to create the actual channel definition, for this example we'll call it `chat`. You create a\n+channel definition by adding a new entry to the `channels` section with the key as its name and the id as the one\n+you copied in the last step.\n+> ![New Def](https://i.imgur.com/dc7kIkl.gif)\n+\n+3. Finally, scroll down to the `message-types` section and change the `chat` message type to your newly created\n+channel definition. Once you do that, save and either run `/ess reload` if your server is running or start your\n+server.\n+> ![Move](https://i.imgur.com/qPVWkWF.gif)\n+\n+4. That's all you need to know about the basics of the message system!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Receive Discord Messages in Minecraft\n+After reading the [configuring messages section](#configuring-messages), you should now have a few discord\n+channels defined in the `channels` of your config. You're probably wondering how you can let your players start\n+to see messages from discord in minecraft chat. Say I defined a channel named `chat` in the `channels` section\n+of your config, and I wanted to let players see discord messages from that channel in minecraft chat; This can\n+be accomplished very simply by giving players the `essentials.discord.receive.chat` permission. This would relay\n+all discord messages from the `chat` channel to players with that permission. Another example: say I have a staff\n+channel in discord that I want only staff members in the minecraft server to see. Provided there is a `staff`\n+channel defined in the `channels` section of the config, I can give staff members the\n+`essentials.discord.receive.staff` permission, and they will start to see messages from that channel.\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Discord Commands\n+EssentialsXDiscord uses Discord's slash command system to let you type commands into discord without it being\n+seen by other people in the server. With this system, you are able to execute console commands, message players,\n+and see the current player list.\n+\n+For example, here's what the `/execute` command looks like by default:\n+> ![/execute](https://i.imgur.com/yPN22bV.gif)\n+\n+As you can see, you can seamlessly run commands without people seeing the content of your commands or their\n+response. Additionally, you can also delete the responses once you're done looking at them, so they don't clutter\n+your chat.\n+\n+However, this is all configurable! In the `commands` section of the config, lies a ton of options to configure\n+settings on a per-command basis. Below are explanations of what all the configuration options mean and how to use\n+them.\n+\n+* `enabled`\n+  * Default: `true`\n+  * Description: `Whether or not the command should be enabled and therefore shown on discord. Note that you\n+    must restart your minecraft server before this option takes effect.`\n+* `hide-command`\n+  * Default: `true`\n+  * Description: `Whether other people should not be able to see what commands you execute. Setting to false\n+    would allow people in the same channel as you to see exactly what command you execute. In the example below,\n+    you can see how disabling this option shows a message of the user and the command they executed.`\n+  * Example: ![Show Command](https://i.imgur.com/Q61iP4n.gif)\n+* `allowed-roles`\n+  * Description: `A list of user ids or role names/ids that are allowed to use the command. You can also use '*'\n+    in order to allow everyone to use the command.`\n+* `admin-roles`\n+  * `A list of user ids or role names/ids that have extra features in the command.

Before starting your server, there are a few steps you have to take. First, you must create a new\n+discord bot at [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).\n+\n+1. Once on that page, click on \"New Application\" button on the top right, give your bot a name, and\n+then click \"Create\".\n+> ![Creating Application](https://i.imgur.com/8ffp4R1.gif)\n+> `New Application` -> Give Application a Name -> `Create`\n+\n+2. Once you create the application, you'll be directed to its overview. From this screen, you'll\n+need to copy your \"Client ID\" and save it for a later step. To copy your client id, click the\n+upper-left most blue \"Copy\" button. Make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Copy Client ID](https://i.imgur.com/W3OMTu5.gif)\n+> `Copy` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+3. Optionally, you can set an icon for your application as it will be the icon for the bot too.\n+> ![Avatar](https://i.imgur.com/NuFS9kT.png)\n+\n+4. The next step is actually creating a bot user for your application. From the overview screen,\n+this is done by going to the \"Bot\" tab on the left, then clicking the \"Add Bot\" on the right,\n+and finally then clicking \"Yes, do it!\".\n+> ![Create Bot](https://i.imgur.com/S14iAFS.gif)\n+> `Bot` -> `Add Bot` -> `Yes, do it!`\n+\n+5. Once on this screen, you'll need to uncheck the \"Public Bot\" setting and then click \"Save Changes\",\n+so other people can't add your bot to servers that are not your own.\n+> ![Disable Public Bot](https://i.imgur.com/HHqWvQ1.gif)\n+> Uncheck `Public Bot` -> `Save Changes`\n+\n+6. Finally, you'll need to copy your bot's token and save it for a later step. To copy your bot's token,\n+click the blue \"Copy\" button right of your bot's icon. Make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Copy Token](https://i.imgur.com/OqpaSQH.gif)\n+> `Copy` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+   \n+7. Next up is adding your bot to your discord server. First, goto [essentialsx.net/discord.html](https://essentialsx.net/discord.html)\n+and paste your Client ID you copied from step 2 into the text box on that page. Once you do that, click\n+the \"Authorize\" button next to the text box. This will redirect you to Discord's authorization website \n+to chose which server to add the bot to. Note for advanced users: Please use the `essentialsx.net` website above \n+even if you think you already know how to invite bots. Bots for EssentialsXDiscord require more than just the `bot`\n+scope to work, so please just use the link above even if you think you know what you're doing.\n+> ![OAuth Link Gen](https://i.imgur.com/u6MFJgQ.gif)\n+> Paste Client ID -> `Authorize`\n+\n+8. Once on the Discord authorization website, select the server from the \"Select a server\" dropdown \n+that you want to add the bot to. Then click the \"Authorize\" button. You may be prompted to confirm\n+you are not a bot, proceed with that like you would any other captcha.\n+> ![Authorize](https://i.imgur.com/KXkESqC.gif)\n+> Select Server -> `Authorize`\n+\n+9. For the next few steps, you're going to need to do some stuff in discord, so start up your\n+Discord desktop/web client. \n+\n+10. Once in your Discord client, you'll need to enable developer mode. Do this by going into the \n+Settings, then go to the \"Appearance\" tab and check on the \"Developer Mode\" at the bottom of the\n+page. Once you've checked \"Developer Mode\" on, click the `X` at the top right to exit Settings.\n+> ![Developer Mode](https://i.imgur.com/CrW31Up.gif)\n+> `User Settings` -> `Appearance` -> Check `Developer Mode` -> Exit Settings\n+\n+11. Next is copying a few IDs. First up, you'll want to copy the server (aka guild) id. Do this by\n+finding the server you added the bot to, right click its icon, and click \"Copy ID\". Once you copied\n+it, make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Guild ID](https://i.imgur.com/0mg2yT3.gif)\n+> Right click server -> `Copy ID` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+12. The other ID you need to copy is the ID of the channel you wish to be your primary channel.\n+In other words, this will be the channel that, by default, receives messages for player chat/join/leave/death\n+messages as well as mute/kicks. To see how to further configure message types, see [Configuring Messages](#configuring-messages).\n+> ![Primary Channel ID](https://i.imgur.com/uMODfiQ.gif)\n+> Right click your 'primary' channel -> `Copy ID` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+13. You've successfully copied all the necessary IDs needed for a basic setup. Next up is generating the\n+default config for EssentialsXDiscord, so you can start setting it up! Do this by putting the\n+EssentialsXDiscord jar (you can download it [here](https://essentialsx.net/downloads.html) if you do not\n+already have one) in your plugins folder, starting your server, and then stopping it as soon as it finishes\n+starting up.\n+> ![Start/Stop Server](https://i.imgur.com/JQX6hqM.gif)\n+> Drag EssentialsXDiscord jar into plugins folder -> Start Server -> Stop Server\n+\n+14. Now you can start to configure the plugin with all the stuff you copied from earlier. Open the config\n+for EssentialsXDiscord located at `plugins/EssentialsDiscord/config.yml`. When you open the config, the\n+first thing to configure is your bot's token. Replace `INSERT-TOKEN-HERE` in the config with the token you\n+copied earlier from step 6.\n+> ![Paste Token](https://i.imgur.com/EnD31Wg.gif)\n+> Re-Copy Token from Step 6 -> Paste as token value \n+\n+15. Next, is the guild id, replace the zeros for the guild value in the config with the guild id you copied\n+from step 13.\n+> ![Paste Guild](https://i.imgur.com/YxkHykd.gif)\n+\n+16. Finally, you'll need to paste the primary channel id you copied from step 14 and paste it as the\n+primary value in the channels section and once you've done that save the config file!\n+> ![Paste Primary](https://i.imgur.com/4xaHMfO.gif)\n+\n+17.

Before starting your server, there are a few steps you have to take. First, you must create a new\n+discord bot at [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).\n+\n+1. Once on that page, click on \"New Application\" button on the top right, give your bot a name, and\n+then click \"Create\".\n+> ![Creating Application](https://i.imgur.com/8ffp4R1.gif)\n+> `New Application` -> Give Application a Name -> `Create`\n+\n+2. Once you create the application, you'll be directed to its overview. From this screen, you'll\n+need to copy your \"Client ID\" and save it for a later step. To copy your client id, click the\n+upper-left most blue \"Copy\" button. Make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Copy Client ID](https://i.imgur.com/W3OMTu5.gif)\n+> `Copy` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+3. Optionally, you can set an icon for your application as it will be the icon for the bot too.\n+> ![Avatar](https://i.imgur.com/NuFS9kT.png)\n+\n+4. The next step is actually creating a bot user for your application. From the overview screen,\n+this is done by going to the \"Bot\" tab on the left, then clicking the \"Add Bot\" on the right,\n+and finally then clicking \"Yes, do it!\".\n+> ![Create Bot](https://i.imgur.com/S14iAFS.gif)\n+> `Bot` -> `Add Bot` -> `Yes, do it!`\n+\n+5. Once on this screen, you'll need to uncheck the \"Public Bot\" setting and then click \"Save Changes\",\n+so other people can't add your bot to servers that are not your own.\n+> ![Disable Public Bot](https://i.imgur.com/HHqWvQ1.gif)\n+> Uncheck `Public Bot` -> `Save Changes`\n+\n+6. Finally, you'll need to copy your bot's token and save it for a later step. To copy your bot's token,\n+click the blue \"Copy\" button right of your bot's icon. Make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Copy Token](https://i.imgur.com/OqpaSQH.gif)\n+> `Copy` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+   \n+7. Next up is adding your bot to your discord server. First, goto [essentialsx.net/discord.html](https://essentialsx.net/discord.html)\n+and paste your Client ID you copied from step 2 into the text box on that page. Once you do that, click\n+the \"Authorize\" button next to the text box. This will redirect you to Discord's authorization website \n+to chose which server to add the bot to. Note for advanced users: Please use the `essentialsx.net` website above \n+even if you think you already know how to invite bots. Bots for EssentialsXDiscord require more than just the `bot`\n+scope to work, so please just use the link above even if you think you know what you're doing.\n+> ![OAuth Link Gen](https://i.imgur.com/u6MFJgQ.gif)\n+> Paste Client ID -> `Authorize`\n+\n+8. Once on the Discord authorization website, select the server from the \"Select a server\" dropdown \n+that you want to add the bot to. Then click the \"Authorize\" button. You may be prompted to confirm\n+you are not a bot, proceed with that like you would any other captcha.\n+> ![Authorize](https://i.imgur.com/KXkESqC.gif)\n+> Select Server -> `Authorize`\n+\n+9. For the next few steps, you're going to need to do some stuff in discord, so start up your\n+Discord desktop/web client. \n+\n+10. Once in your Discord client, you'll need to enable developer mode. Do this by going into the \n+Settings, then go to the \"Appearance\" tab and check on the \"Developer Mode\" at the bottom of the\n+page. Once you've checked \"Developer Mode\" on, click the `X` at the top right to exit Settings.\n+> ![Developer Mode](https://i.imgur.com/CrW31Up.gif)\n+> `User Settings` -> `Appearance` -> Check `Developer Mode` -> Exit Settings\n+\n+11. Next is copying a few IDs. First up, you'll want to copy the server (aka guild) id. Do this by\n+finding the server you added the bot to, right click its icon, and click \"Copy ID\". Once you copied\n+it, make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Guild ID](https://i.imgur.com/0mg2yT3.gif)\n+> Right click server -> `Copy ID` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+12. The other ID you need to copy is the ID of the channel you wish to be your primary channel.\n+In other words, this will be the channel that, by default, receives messages for player chat/join/leave/death\n+messages as well as mute/kicks. To see how to further configure message types, see [Configuring Messages](#configuring-messages).\n+> ![Primary Channel ID](https://i.imgur.com/uMODfiQ.gif)\n+> Right click your 'primary' channel -> `Copy ID` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+13. You've successfully copied all the necessary IDs needed for a basic setup. Next up is generating the\n+default config for EssentialsXDiscord, so you can start setting it up! Do this by putting the\n+EssentialsXDiscord jar (you can download it [here](https://essentialsx.net/downloads.html) if you do not\n+already have one) in your plugins folder, starting your server, and then stopping it as soon as it finishes\n+starting up.\n+> ![Start/Stop Server](https://i.imgur.com/JQX6hqM.gif)\n+> Drag EssentialsXDiscord jar into plugins folder -> Start Server -> Stop Server\n+\n+14. Now you can start to configure the plugin with all the stuff you copied from earlier. Open the config\n+for EssentialsXDiscord located at `plugins/EssentialsDiscord/config.yml`. When you open the config, the\n+first thing to configure is your bot's token. Replace `INSERT-TOKEN-HERE` in the config with the token you\n+copied earlier from step 6.\n+> ![Paste Token](https://i.imgur.com/EnD31Wg.gif)\n+> Re-Copy Token from Step 6 -> Paste as token value \n+\n+15. Next, is the guild id, replace the zeros for the guild value in the config with the guild id you copied\n+from step 13.\n+> ![Paste Guild](https://i.imgur.com/YxkHykd.gif)\n+\n+16. Finally, you'll need to paste the primary channel id you copied from step 14 and paste it as the\n+primary value in the channels section and once you've done that save the config file!\n+> ![Paste Primary](https://i.imgur.com/4xaHMfO.gif)\n+\n+17. Congratulations, you've completed the initial setup guide! When you start up your server, you should\n+notice that chat and other messages start showing up in the channel you requested they be. Now that you\n+completed the initial, go back up to the [Table Of Contents](#table-of-contents) to see what other cool things you can do!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Console Relay\n+The console relay is pretty self-explanatory: it relays everything on your console into discord channel of\n+your choosing. The console relay is ridiculously easy to setup and if your server is already running, you don't\n+need to reload it!\n+\n+0. This assumes you've already done the initial setup.\n+\n+1. Go to the discord server that your bot is in and find the channel you wish to use for console output.\n+Right click on the channel and click \"Copy ID\". Save this id for the next step.\n+> ![Copy ID](https://i.imgur.com/qvDfSLv.gif)\n+> Find console channel -> Right Click -> `Copy ID`\n+\n+2. Now that you have that copied, open the EssentialsXDiscord config and find the `console` section. In that\n+section, replace the zeros for the `channel` value with the channel id you copied from the last step. Once\n+you paste it, make sure you save the config.\n+> ![Paste ID](https://i.imgur.com/NicdpGw.gif)\n+\n+3. Finally, if your server is running, run `ess reload` from your console, otherwise start up your server. You\n+should notice console output being directed to that channel! That is all you need if you're okay with the default\n+settings. Otherwise, if you'd like to see what other options you can use to customize console output, stick around.\n+\n+4. The first thing you can customize is the format of the message sent to discord. By default, the timestamp,\n+level (info/warn/error/etc), and message are shown for each console message. Let's say you wanted to make the\n+timestamp and level bold, since this message would be using discord markdown, we can just add \\*\\* to both sides of\n+level and timestamp. Then once you've done that, just do `/ess reload` and you should see your changes on discord.\n+> ![Bold Format](https://i.imgur.com/jD9mH14.gif)\n+\n+5. Next, you can also configure the name you wish the to show above console messages. By default, it's \"EssX Console\n+Relay\" but can be switched to anything you want.\n+> ![Change Name](https://i.imgur.com/xtrt1Jt.gif)\n+\n+6. Finally, you can also choose to enable an option to treat any message by a user in the console channel as a\n+console command. This will mean that anyone who can send messages in your console channel **will be able to execute \n+commands as the console**. It is suggested that you stick to the regular `/execute` command \n+(see [Discord Commands](#discord-commands)) as those can be restricted to specific roles/users and are also not\n+restricted to the console channel.\n+> ![Command Relay](https://i.imgur.com/w3cfVUw.gif)\n+\n+7. That's all the options for the command relay!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Configuring Messages\n+EssentialsXDiscord aims to keep its message-type system basic enough that simple things take little changes, while\n+giving more fine grain control to those you want it.\n+\n+To give you a general overview of the system, EssentialsXDiscord allows you to define different channel IDs in the\n+`channels` section of the config. By default, two channels are pre-populated in the `channels` section, `primary`\n+and `staff`. If you only completed the initial setup, the `staff` channel definition is all zeros. This is fine in\n+most situations however, as the message system will always fallback to the `primary` channel if a channel ID is\n+invalid.\n+\n+Now on the to the types of messages you can receive themselves (which is where you're going to use these channel \n+definitions). In the `message-types` section of the config, you can see a list of message types (join/leave/chat/etc)\n+on the left (as the key), and on the right there is a channel definition.\n+\n+For the sake of example lets say we want to send all chat messages to their own channel. We can do this by creating\n+a new channel definition and setting the `chat` message type to said channel definition. Below are step-by-step \n+instructions for said example, you can follow along to get the gist of how to apply this to other use cases\n+\n+1. Find the channel on discord you want to only send chat messages to and then right click the channel and click\n+\"Copy ID\".\n+> ![Copy ID](https://i.imgur.com/ri7NZkD.gif)\n+\n+2. Next you need to create the actual channel definition, for this example we'll call it `chat`. You create a\n+channel definition by adding a new entry to the `channels` section with the key as its name and the id as the one\n+you copied in the last step.\n+> ![New Def](https://i.imgur.com/dc7kIkl.gif)\n+\n+3. Finally, scroll down to the `message-types` section and change the `chat` message type to your newly created\n+channel definition. Once you do that, save and either run `/ess reload` if your server is running or start your\n+server.\n+> ![Move](https://i.imgur.com/qPVWkWF.gif)\n+\n+4. That's all you need to know about the basics of the message system!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Receive Discord Messages in Minecraft\n+After reading the [configuring messages section](#configuring-messages), you should now have a few discord\n+channels defined in the `channels` of your config. You're probably wondering how you can let your players start\n+to see messages from discord in minecraft chat. Say I defined a channel named `chat` in the `channels` section\n+of your config, and I wanted to let players see discord messages from that channel in minecraft chat; This can\n+be accomplished very simply by giving players the `essentials.discord.receive.chat` permission. This would relay\n+all discord messages from the `chat` channel to players with that permission. Another example: say I have a staff\n+channel in discord that I want only staff members in the minecraft server to see. Provided there is a `staff`\n+channel defined in the `channels` section of the config, I can give staff members the\n+`essentials.discord.receive.staff` permission, and they will start to see messages from that channel.\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Discord Commands\n+EssentialsXDiscord uses Discord's slash command system to let you type commands into discord without it being\n+seen by other people in the server. With this system, you are able to execute console commands, message players,\n+and see the current player list.\n+\n+For example, here's what the `/execute` command looks like by default:\n+> ![/execute](https://i.imgur.com/yPN22bV.gif)\n+\n+As you can see, you can seamlessly run commands without people seeing the content of your commands or their\n+response. Additionally, you can also delete the responses once you're done looking at them, so they don't clutter\n+your chat.\n+\n+However, this is all configurable! In the `commands` section of the config, lies a ton of options to configure\n+settings on a per-command basis. Below are explanations of what all the configuration options mean and how to use\n+them.\n+\n+* `enabled`\n+  * Default: `true`\n+  * Description: `Whether or not the command should be enabled and therefore shown on discord. Note that you\n+    must restart your minecraft server before this option takes effect.`\n+* `hide-command`\n+  * Default: `true`\n+  * Description: `Whether other people should not be able to see what commands you execute. Setting to false\n+    would allow people in the same channel as you to see exactly what command you execute. In the example below,\n+    you can see how disabling this option shows a message of the user and the command they executed.`\n+  * Example: ![Show Command](https://i.imgur.com/Q61iP4n.gif)\n+* `allowed-roles`\n+  * Description: `A list of user ids or role names/ids that are allowed to use the command. You can also use '*'\n+    in order to allow everyone to use the command.`\n+* `admin-roles`\n+  * `A list of user ids or role names/ids that have extra features in the command. For example, in the list\n+    command, admin-roles allows people to see vanished players.`\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Misc Permissions\n+EssentialsXDiscord has a few miscellanies permissions that may be important to know about;\n+\n+* `essentials.discord.markdown` - Allows players to bypass the markdown filter, so that they can \n+bold/underline/italic/etc their minecraft chat messages for discord.\n+* `essentials.discord.ping` - Allows players to bypass the ping filter, so that they can ping @everyone/@here\n+from minecraft chat.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "99a4b3ab018d821d7dc3e6713b3099f05db6ff73"}, "originalPosition": 262}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkNDE4NjY4NjYyOnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "EssentialsDiscord/README.md", "isResolved": true, "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMS0wNi0yNlQyMjowOToxOFrOJ0sKTg==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMS0wNi0yNlQyMjowOToxOFrOJ0sKTg==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDY1OTIyOTI2Mg==", "bodyText": "This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

Now that you have that copied, open the EssentialsXDiscord config and find the `console` section. In that\n+section, replace the zeros for the `channel` value with the channel id you copied from the last step. Once\n+you paste it, make sure you save the config.\n+> ![Paste ID](https://i.imgur.com/NicdpGw.gif)\n+\n+3. Finally, if your server is running, run `ess reload` from your console, otherwise start up your server. You\n+should notice console output being directed to that channel! That is all you need if you're okay with the default\n+settings. Otherwise, if you'd like to see what other options you can use to customize console output, stick around.\n+\n+4. The first thing you can customize is the format of the message sent to discord. By default, the timestamp,\n+level (info/warn/error/etc), and message are shown for each console message. Let's say you wanted to make the\n+timestamp and level bold, since this message would be using discord markdown, we can just add \\*\\* to both sides of\n+level and timestamp. Then once you've done that, just do `/ess reload` and you should see your changes on discord.\n+> ![Bold Format](https://i.imgur.com/jD9mH14.gif)\n+\n+5. Next, you can also configure the name you wish the to show above console messages. By default, it's \"EssX Console\n+Relay\" but can be switched to anything you want.\n+> ![Change Name](https://i.imgur.com/xtrt1Jt.gif)\n+\n+6. Finally, you can also choose to enable an option to treat any message by a user in the console channel as a\n+console command. This will mean that anyone who can send messages in your console channel **will be able to execute \n+commands as the console**. It is suggested that you stick to the regular `/execute` command \n+(see [Discord Commands](#discord-commands)) as those can be restricted to specific roles/users and are also not\n+restricted to the console channel.\n+> ![Command Relay](https://i.imgur.com/w3cfVUw.gif)\n+\n+7. That's all the options for the command relay!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Configuring Messages\n+EssentialsXDiscord aims to keep its message-type system basic enough that simple things take little changes, while\n+giving more fine grain control to those you want it.\n+\n+To give you a general overview of the system, EssentialsXDiscord allows you to define different channel IDs in the\n+`channels` section of the config. By default, two channels are pre-populated in the `channels` section, `primary`\n+and `staff`. If you only completed the initial setup, the `staff` channel definition is all zeros. This is fine in\n+most situations however, as the message system will always fallback to the `primary` channel if a channel ID is\n+invalid.\n+\n+Now on the to the types of messages you can receive themselves (which is where you're going to use these channel \n+definitions). In the `message-types` section of the config, you can see a list of message types (join/leave/chat/etc)\n+on the left (as the key), and on the right there is a channel definition.\n+\n+For the sake of example lets say we want to send all chat messages to their own channel. We can do this by creating\n+a new channel definition and setting the `chat` message type to said channel definition. Below are step-by-step \n+instructions for said example, you can follow along to get the gist of how to apply this to other use cases\n+\n+1. Find the channel on discord you want to only send chat messages to and then right click the channel and click\n+\"Copy ID\".\n+> ![Copy ID](https://i.imgur.com/ri7NZkD.gif)\n+\n+2. Next you need to create the actual channel definition, for this example we'll call it `chat`. You create a\n+channel definition by adding a new entry to the `channels` section with the key as its name and the id as the one\n+you copied in the last step.\n+> ![New Def](https://i.imgur.com/dc7kIkl.gif)\n+\n+3. Finally, scroll down to the `message-types` section and change the `chat` message type to your newly created\n+channel definition. Once you do that, save and either run `/ess reload` if your server is running or start your\n+server.\n+> ![Move](https://i.imgur.com/qPVWkWF.gif)\n+\n+4. That's all you need to know about the basics of the message system!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Receive Discord Messages in Minecraft\n+After reading the [configuring messages section](#configuring-messages), you should now have a few discord\n+channels defined in the `channels` of your config. You're probably wondering how you can let your players start\n+to see messages from discord in minecraft chat. Say I defined a channel named `chat` in the `channels` section\n+of your config, and I wanted to let players see discord messages from that channel in minecraft chat; This can\n+be accomplished very simply by giving players the `essentials.discord.receive.chat` permission. This would relay\n+all discord messages from the `chat` channel to players with that permission. Another example: say I have a staff\n+channel in discord that I want only staff members in the minecraft server to see. Provided there is a `staff`\n+channel defined in the `channels` section of the config, I can give staff members the\n+`essentials.discord.receive.staff` permission, and they will start to see messages from that channel.\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Discord Commands\n+EssentialsXDiscord uses Discord's slash command system to let you type commands into discord without it being\n+seen by other people in the server. With this system, you are able to execute console commands, message players,\n+and see the current player list.\n+\n+For example, here's what the `/execute` command looks like by default:\n+> ![/execute](https://i.imgur.com/yPN22bV.gif)\n+\n+As you can see, you can seamlessly run commands without people seeing the content of your commands or their\n+response. Additionally, you can also delete the responses once you're done looking at them, so they don't clutter\n+your chat.\n+\n+However, this is all configurable! In the `commands` section of the config, lies a ton of options to configure\n+settings on a per-command basis. Below are explanations of what all the configuration options mean and how to use\n+them.\n+\n+* `enabled`\n+  * Default: `true`\n+  * Description: `Whether or not the command should be enabled and therefore shown on discord. Note that you\n+    must restart your minecraft server before this option takes effect.`\n+* `hide-command`\n+  * Default: `true`\n+  * Description: `Whether other people should not be able to see what commands you execute. Setting to false\n+    would allow people in the same channel as you to see exactly what command you execute. In the example below,\n+    you can see how disabling this option shows a message of the user and the command they executed.`\n+  * Example: ![Show Command](https://i.imgur.com/Q61iP4n.gif)\n+* `allowed-roles`\n+  * Description: `A list of user ids or role names/ids that are allowed to use the command. You can also use '*'\n+    in order to allow everyone to use the command.`\n+* `admin-roles`\n+  * `A list of user ids or role names/ids that have extra features in the command. For example, in the list\n+    command, admin-roles allows people to see vanished players.`\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Misc Permissions\n+EssentialsXDiscord has a few miscellanies permissions that may be important to know about;\n+\n+* `essentials.discord.markdown` - Allows players to bypass the markdown filter, so that they can \n+bold/underline/italic/etc their minecraft chat messages for discord.\n+* `essentials.discord.ping` - Allows players to bypass the ping filter, so that they can ping @everyone/@here\n+from minecraft chat.\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Developer API\n+EssentialsXDiscord has a pretty extensive API which allows any third party plugin to build", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "99a4b3ab018d821d7dc3e6713b3099f05db6ff73"}, "originalPosition": 267}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkNDE4NjY4Njc4OnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "EssentialsDiscord/README.md", "isResolved": true, "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMS0wNi0yNlQyMjowOToyNlrOJ0sKXw==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMS0wNi0yNlQyMjowOToyNlrOJ0sKXw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDY1OTIyOTI3OQ==", "bodyText": "This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

Before starting your server, there are a few steps you have to take. First, you must create a new\n+discord bot at [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).\n+\n+1. Once on that page, click on \"New Application\" button on the top right, give your bot a name, and\n+then click \"Create\".\n+> ![Creating Application](https://i.imgur.com/8ffp4R1.gif)\n+> `New Application` -> Give Application a Name -> `Create`\n+\n+2. Once you create the application, you'll be directed to its overview. From this screen, you'll\n+need to copy your \"Client ID\" and save it for a later step. To copy your client id, click the\n+upper-left most blue \"Copy\" button. Make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Copy Client ID](https://i.imgur.com/W3OMTu5.gif)\n+> `Copy` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+3. Optionally, you can set an icon for your application as it will be the icon for the bot too.\n+> ![Avatar](https://i.imgur.com/NuFS9kT.png)\n+\n+4. The next step is actually creating a bot user for your application. From the overview screen,\n+this is done by going to the \"Bot\" tab on the left, then clicking the \"Add Bot\" on the right,\n+and finally then clicking \"Yes, do it!\".\n+> ![Create Bot](https://i.imgur.com/S14iAFS.gif)\n+> `Bot` -> `Add Bot` -> `Yes, do it!`\n+\n+5. Once on this screen, you'll need to uncheck the \"Public Bot\" setting and then click \"Save Changes\",\n+so other people can't add your bot to servers that are not your own.\n+> ![Disable Public Bot](https://i.imgur.com/HHqWvQ1.gif)\n+> Uncheck `Public Bot` -> `Save Changes`\n+\n+6. Finally, you'll need to copy your bot's token and save it for a later step. To copy your bot's token,\n+click the blue \"Copy\" button right of your bot's icon. Make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Copy Token](https://i.imgur.com/OqpaSQH.gif)\n+> `Copy` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+   \n+7. Next up is adding your bot to your discord server. First, goto [essentialsx.net/discord.html](https://essentialsx.net/discord.html)\n+and paste your Client ID you copied from step 2 into the text box on that page. Once you do that, click\n+the \"Authorize\" button next to the text box. This will redirect you to Discord's authorization website \n+to chose which server to add the bot to. Note for advanced users: Please use the `essentialsx.net` website above \n+even if you think you already know how to invite bots. Bots for EssentialsXDiscord require more than just the `bot`\n+scope to work, so please just use the link above even if you think you know what you're doing.\n+> ![OAuth Link Gen](https://i.imgur.com/u6MFJgQ.gif)\n+> Paste Client ID -> `Authorize`\n+\n+8. Once on the Discord authorization website, select the server from the \"Select a server\" dropdown \n+that you want to add the bot to. Then click the \"Authorize\" button. You may be prompted to confirm\n+you are not a bot, proceed with that like you would any other captcha.\n+> ![Authorize](https://i.imgur.com/KXkESqC.gif)\n+> Select Server -> `Authorize`\n+\n+9. For the next few steps, you're going to need to do some stuff in discord, so start up your\n+Discord desktop/web client. \n+\n+10. Once in your Discord client, you'll need to enable developer mode. Do this by going into the \n+Settings, then go to the \"Appearance\" tab and check on the \"Developer Mode\" at the bottom of the\n+page. Once you've checked \"Developer Mode\" on, click the `X` at the top right to exit Settings.\n+> ![Developer Mode](https://i.imgur.com/CrW31Up.gif)\n+> `User Settings` -> `Appearance` -> Check `Developer Mode` -> Exit Settings\n+\n+11. Next is copying a few IDs. First up, you'll want to copy the server (aka guild) id. Do this by\n+finding the server you added the bot to, right click its icon, and click \"Copy ID\". Once you copied\n+it, make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Guild ID](https://i.imgur.com/0mg2yT3.gif)\n+> Right click server -> `Copy ID` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+12. The other ID you need to copy is the ID of the channel you wish to be your primary channel.\n+In other words, this will be the channel that, by default, receives messages for player chat/join/leave/death\n+messages as well as mute/kicks. To see how to further configure message types, see [Configuring Messages](#configuring-messages).\n+> ![Primary Channel ID](https://i.imgur.com/uMODfiQ.gif)\n+> Right click your 'primary' channel -> `Copy ID` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+13. You've successfully copied all the necessary IDs needed for a basic setup. Next up is generating the\n+default config for EssentialsXDiscord, so you can start setting it up! Do this by putting the\n+EssentialsXDiscord jar (you can download it [here](https://essentialsx.net/downloads.html) if you do not\n+already have one) in your plugins folder, starting your server, and then stopping it as soon as it finishes\n+starting up.\n+> ![Start/Stop Server](https://i.imgur.com/JQX6hqM.gif)\n+> Drag EssentialsXDiscord jar into plugins folder -> Start Server -> Stop Server\n+\n+14. Now you can start to configure the plugin with all the stuff you copied from earlier. Open the config\n+for EssentialsXDiscord located at `plugins/EssentialsDiscord/config.yml`. When you open the config, the\n+first thing to configure is your bot's token. Replace `INSERT-TOKEN-HERE` in the config with the token you\n+copied earlier from step 6.\n+> ![Paste Token](https://i.imgur.com/EnD31Wg.gif)\n+> Re-Copy Token from Step 6 -> Paste as token value \n+\n+15. Next, is the guild id, replace the zeros for the guild value in the config with the guild id you copied\n+from step 13.\n+> ![Paste Guild](https://i.imgur.com/YxkHykd.gif)\n+\n+16. Finally, you'll need to paste the primary channel id you copied from step 14 and paste it as the\n+primary value in the channels section and once you've done that save the config file!\n+> ![Paste Primary](https://i.imgur.com/4xaHMfO.gif)\n+\n+17. Congratulations, you've completed the initial setup guide! When you start up your server, you should\n+notice that chat and other messages start showing up in the channel you requested they be. Now that you\n+completed the initial, go back up to the [Table Of Contents](#table-of-contents) to see what other cool things you can do!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Console Relay\n+The console relay is pretty self-explanatory: it relays everything on your console into discord channel of\n+your choosing. The console relay is ridiculously easy to setup and if your server is already running, you don't\n+need to reload it!\n+\n+0. This assumes you've already done the initial setup.\n+\n+1. Go to the discord server that your bot is in and find the channel you wish to use for console output.\n+Right click on the channel and click \"Copy ID\". Save this id for the next step.\n+> ![Copy ID](https://i.imgur.com/qvDfSLv.gif)\n+> Find console channel -> Right Click -> `Copy ID`\n+\n+2. Now that you have that copied, open the EssentialsXDiscord config and find the `console` section. In that\n+section, replace the zeros for the `channel` value with the channel id you copied from the last step. Once\n+you paste it, make sure you save the config.\n+> ![Paste ID](https://i.imgur.com/NicdpGw.gif)\n+\n+3. Finally, if your server is running, run `ess reload` from your console, otherwise start up your server. You\n+should notice console output being directed to that channel!

Before starting your server, there are a few steps you have to take. First, you must create a new\n+discord bot at [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).\n+\n+1. Once on that page, click on \"New Application\" button on the top right, give your bot a name, and\n+then click \"Create\".\n+> ![Creating Application](https://i.imgur.com/8ffp4R1.gif)\n+> `New Application` -> Give Application a Name -> `Create`\n+\n+2. Once you create the application, you'll be directed to its overview. From this screen, you'll\n+need to copy your \"Client ID\" and save it for a later step. To copy your client id, click the\n+upper-left most blue \"Copy\" button. Make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Copy Client ID](https://i.imgur.com/W3OMTu5.gif)\n+> `Copy` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+3. Optionally, you can set an icon for your application as it will be the icon for the bot too.\n+> ![Avatar](https://i.imgur.com/NuFS9kT.png)\n+\n+4. The next step is actually creating a bot user for your application. From the overview screen,\n+this is done by going to the \"Bot\" tab on the left, then clicking the \"Add Bot\" on the right,\n+and finally then clicking \"Yes, do it!\".\n+> ![Create Bot](https://i.imgur.com/S14iAFS.gif)\n+> `Bot` -> `Add Bot` -> `Yes, do it!`\n+\n+5. Once on this screen, you'll need to uncheck the \"Public Bot\" setting and then click \"Save Changes\",\n+so other people can't add your bot to servers that are not your own.\n+> ![Disable Public Bot](https://i.imgur.com/HHqWvQ1.gif)\n+> Uncheck `Public Bot` -> `Save Changes`\n+\n+6. Finally, you'll need to copy your bot's token and save it for a later step. To copy your bot's token,\n+click the blue \"Copy\" button right of your bot's icon. Make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Copy Token](https://i.imgur.com/OqpaSQH.gif)\n+> `Copy` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+   \n+7. Next up is adding your bot to your discord server. First, goto [essentialsx.net/discord.html](https://essentialsx.net/discord.html)\n+and paste your Client ID you copied from step 2 into the text box on that page. Once you do that, click\n+the \"Authorize\" button next to the text box. This will redirect you to Discord's authorization website \n+to chose which server to add the bot to. Note for advanced users: Please use the `essentialsx.net` website above \n+even if you think you already know how to invite bots. Bots for EssentialsXDiscord require more than just the `bot`\n+scope to work, so please just use the link above even if you think you know what you're doing.\n+> ![OAuth Link Gen](https://i.imgur.com/u6MFJgQ.gif)\n+> Paste Client ID -> `Authorize`\n+\n+8. Once on the Discord authorization website, select the server from the \"Select a server\" dropdown \n+that you want to add the bot to. Then click the \"Authorize\" button. You may be prompted to confirm\n+you are not a bot, proceed with that like you would any other captcha.\n+> ![Authorize](https://i.imgur.com/KXkESqC.gif)\n+> Select Server -> `Authorize`\n+\n+9. For the next few steps, you're going to need to do some stuff in discord, so start up your\n+Discord desktop/web client. \n+\n+10. Once in your Discord client, you'll need to enable developer mode. Do this by going into the \n+Settings, then go to the \"Appearance\" tab and check on the \"Developer Mode\" at the bottom of the\n+page. Once you've checked \"Developer Mode\" on, click the `X` at the top right to exit Settings.\n+> ![Developer Mode](https://i.imgur.com/CrW31Up.gif)\n+> `User Settings` -> `Appearance` -> Check `Developer Mode` -> Exit Settings\n+\n+11. Next is copying a few IDs. First up, you'll want to copy the server (aka guild) id. Do this by\n+finding the server you added the bot to, right click its icon, and click \"Copy ID\". Once you copied\n+it, make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Guild ID](https://i.imgur.com/0mg2yT3.gif)\n+> Right click server -> `Copy ID` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+12. The other ID you need to copy is the ID of the channel you wish to be your primary channel.\n+In other words, this will be the channel that, by default, receives messages for player chat/join/leave/death\n+messages as well as mute/kicks. To see how to further configure message types, see [Configuring Messages](#configuring-messages).\n+> ![Primary Channel ID](https://i.imgur.com/uMODfiQ.gif)\n+> Right click your 'primary' channel -> `Copy ID` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+13. You've successfully copied all the necessary IDs needed for a basic setup. Next up is generating the\n+default config for EssentialsXDiscord, so you can start setting it up! Do this by putting the\n+EssentialsXDiscord jar (you can download it [here](https://essentialsx.net/downloads.html) if you do not\n+already have one) in your plugins folder, starting your server, and then stopping it as soon as it finishes\n+starting up.\n+> ![Start/Stop Server](https://i.imgur.com/JQX6hqM.gif)\n+> Drag EssentialsXDiscord jar into plugins folder -> Start Server -> Stop Server\n+\n+14. Now you can start to configure the plugin with all the stuff you copied from earlier. Open the config\n+for EssentialsXDiscord located at `plugins/EssentialsDiscord/config.yml`. When you open the config, the\n+first thing to configure is your bot's token. Replace `INSERT-TOKEN-HERE` in the config with the token you\n+copied earlier from step 6.\n+> ![Paste Token](https://i.imgur.com/EnD31Wg.gif)\n+> Re-Copy Token from Step 6 -> Paste as token value \n+\n+15. Next, is the guild id, replace the zeros for the guild value in the config with the guild id you copied\n+from step 13.\n+> ![Paste Guild](https://i.imgur.com/YxkHykd.gif)\n+\n+16. Finally, you'll need to paste the primary channel id you copied from step 14 and paste it as the\n+primary value in the channels section and once you've done that save the config file!\n+> ![Paste Primary](https://i.imgur.com/4xaHMfO.gif)\n+\n+17. Congratulations, you've completed the initial setup guide! When you start up your server, you should\n+notice that chat and other messages start showing up in the channel you requested they be. Now that you\n+completed the initial, go back up to the [Table Of Contents](#table-of-contents) to see what other cool things you can do!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Console Relay\n+The console relay is pretty self-explanatory: it relays everything on your console into discord channel of\n+your choosing. The console relay is ridiculously easy to setup and if your server is already running, you don't\n+need to reload it!\n+\n+0. This assumes you've already done the initial setup.\n+\n+1. Go to the discord server that your bot is in and find the channel you wish to use for console output.\n+Right click on the channel and click \"Copy ID\". Save this id for the next step.\n+> ![Copy ID](https://i.imgur.com/qvDfSLv.gif)\n+> Find console channel -> Right Click -> `Copy ID`\n+\n+2. Now that you have that copied, open the EssentialsXDiscord config and find the `console` section. In that\n+section, replace the zeros for the `channel` value with the channel id you copied from the last step. Once\n+you paste it, make sure you save the config.\n+> ![Paste ID](https://i.imgur.com/NicdpGw.gif)\n+\n+3. Finally, if your server is running, run `ess reload` from your console, otherwise start up your server. You\n+should notice console output being directed to that channel! That is all you need if you're okay with the default\n+settings. Otherwise, if you'd like to see what other options you can use to customize console output, stick around.\n+\n+4. The first thing you can customize is the format of the message sent to discord. By default, the timestamp,\n+level (info/warn/error/etc), and message are shown for each console message. Let's say you wanted to make the\n+timestamp and level bold, since this message would be using discord markdown, we can just add \\*\\* to both sides of\n+level and timestamp. Then once you've done that, just do `/ess reload` and you should see your changes on discord.\n+> ![Bold Format](https://i.imgur.com/jD9mH14.gif)\n+\n+5. Next, you can also configure the name you wish the to show above console messages. By default, it's \"EssX Console\n+Relay\" but can be switched to anything you want.\n+> ![Change Name](https://i.imgur.com/xtrt1Jt.gif)\n+\n+6. Finally, you can also choose to enable an option to treat any message by a user in the console channel as a\n+console command. This will mean that anyone who can send messages in your console channel **will be able to execute \n+commands as the console**. It is suggested that you stick to the regular `/execute` command \n+(see [Discord Commands](#discord-commands)) as those can be restricted to specific roles/users and are also not\n+restricted to the console channel.\n+> ![Command Relay](https://i.imgur.com/w3cfVUw.gif)\n+\n+7. That's all the options for the command relay!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Configuring Messages\n+EssentialsXDiscord aims to keep its message-type system basic enough that simple things take little changes, while\n+giving more fine grain control to those you want it.\n+\n+To give you a general overview of the system, EssentialsXDiscord allows you to define different channel IDs in the\n+`channels` section of the config. By default, two channels are pre-populated in the `channels` section, `primary`\n+and `staff`. If you only completed the initial setup, the `staff` channel definition is all zeros. This is fine in\n+most situations however, as the message system will always fallback to the `primary` channel if a channel ID is\n+invalid.\n+\n+Now on the to the types of messages you can receive themselves (which is where you're going to use these channel \n+definitions). In the `message-types` section of the config, you can see a list of message types (join/leave/chat/etc)\n+on the left (as the key), and on the right there is a channel definition.\n+\n+For the sake of example lets say we want to send all chat messages to their own channel. We can do this by creating\n+a new channel definition and setting the `chat` message type to said channel definition. Below are step-by-step \n+instructions for said example, you can follow along to get the gist of how to apply this to other use cases\n+\n+1. Find the channel on discord you want to only send chat messages to and then right click the channel and click\n+\"Copy ID\".\n+> ![Copy ID](https://i.imgur.com/ri7NZkD.gif)\n+\n+2. Next you need to create the actual channel definition, for this example we'll call it `chat`. You create a\n+channel definition by adding a new entry to the `channels` section with the key as its name and the id as the one\n+you copied in the last step.\n+> ![New Def](https://i.imgur.com/dc7kIkl.gif)\n+\n+3. Finally, scroll down to the `message-types` section and change the `chat` message type to your newly created\n+channel definition. Once you do that, save and either run `/ess reload` if your server is running or start your\n+server.\n+> ![Move](https://i.imgur.com/qPVWkWF.gif)\n+\n+4. That's all you need to know about the basics of the message system!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Receive Discord Messages in Minecraft\n+After reading the [configuring messages section](#configuring-messages), you should now have a few discord\n+channels defined in the `channels` of your config. You're probably wondering how you can let your players start\n+to see messages from discord in minecraft chat. Say I defined a channel named `chat` in the `channels` section\n+of your config, and I wanted to let players see discord messages from that channel in minecraft chat; This can\n+be accomplished very simply by giving players the `essentials.discord.receive.chat` permission. This would relay\n+all discord messages from the `chat` channel to players with that permission. Another example: say I have a staff\n+channel in discord that I want only staff members in the minecraft server to see. Provided there is a `staff`\n+channel defined in the `channels` section of the config, I can give staff members the\n+`essentials.discord.receive.staff` permission, and they will start to see messages from that channel.\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Discord Commands\n+EssentialsXDiscord uses Discord's slash command system to let you type commands into discord without it being\n+seen by other people in the server. With this system, you are able to execute console commands, message players,\n+and see the current player list.\n+\n+For example, here's what the `/execute` command looks like by default:\n+> ![/execute](https://i.imgur.com/yPN22bV.gif)\n+\n+As you can see, you can seamlessly run commands without people seeing the content of your commands or their\n+response. Additionally, you can also delete the responses once you're done looking at them, so they don't clutter\n+your chat.\n+\n+However, this is all configurable! In the `commands` section of the config, lies a ton of options to configure\n+settings on a per-command basis. Below are explanations of what all the configuration options mean and how to use\n+them.\n+\n+* `enabled`\n+  * Default: `true`\n+  * Description: `Whether or not the command should be enabled and therefore shown on discord. Note that you\n+    must restart your minecraft server before this option takes effect.`\n+* `hide-command`\n+  * Default: `true`\n+  * Description: `Whether other people should not be able to see what commands you execute. Setting to false\n+    would allow people in the same channel as you to see exactly what command you execute. In the example below,\n+    you can see how disabling this option shows a message of the user and the command they executed.`\n+  * Example: ![Show Command](https://i.imgur.com/Q61iP4n.gif)\n+* `allowed-roles`\n+  * Description: `A list of user ids or role names/ids that are allowed to use the command. You can also use '*'\n+    in order to allow everyone to use the command.`\n+* `admin-roles`\n+  * `A list of user ids or role names/ids that have extra features in the command. For example, in the list\n+    command, admin-roles allows people to see vanished players.`\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Misc Permissions\n+EssentialsXDiscord has a few miscellanies permissions that may be important to know about;\n+\n+* `essentials.discord.markdown` - Allows players to bypass the markdown filter, so that they can \n+bold/underline/italic/etc their minecraft chat messages for discord.\n+* `essentials.discord.ping` - Allows players to bypass the ping filter, so that they can ping @everyone/@here\n+from minecraft chat.\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Developer API\n+EssentialsXDiscord has a pretty extensive API which allows any third party plugin to build\n+their own integrations into it. Outside the specific examples below, you can also view\n+javadocs for EssentialsXDiscord [here](https://jd-v2.essentialsx.net/EssentialsDiscord).\n+\n+### Sending Messages to Discord\n+EssentialsXDiscord organizes the types of messages that can be sent along with their \n+destination on discord under the `message-types` section of the `config.yml`.

Now that you\n+completed the initial, go back up to the [Table Of Contents](#table-of-contents) to see what other cool things you can do!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Console Relay\n+The console relay is pretty self-explanatory: it relays everything on your console into discord channel of\n+your choosing. The console relay is ridiculously easy to setup and if your server is already running, you don't\n+need to reload it!\n+\n+0. This assumes you've already done the initial setup.\n+\n+1. Go to the discord server that your bot is in and find the channel you wish to use for console output.\n+Right click on the channel and click \"Copy ID\". Save this id for the next step.\n+> ![Copy ID](https://i.imgur.com/qvDfSLv.gif)\n+> Find console channel -> Right Click -> `Copy ID`\n+\n+2. Now that you have that copied, open the EssentialsXDiscord config and find the `console` section. In that\n+section, replace the zeros for the `channel` value with the channel id you copied from the last step. Once\n+you paste it, make sure you save the config.\n+> ![Paste ID](https://i.imgur.com/NicdpGw.gif)\n+\n+3. Finally, if your server is running, run `ess reload` from your console, otherwise start up your server. You\n+should notice console output being directed to that channel! That is all you need if you're okay with the default\n+settings. Otherwise, if you'd like to see what other options you can use to customize console output, stick around.\n+\n+4. The first thing you can customize is the format of the message sent to discord. By default, the timestamp,\n+level (info/warn/error/etc), and message are shown for each console message. Let's say you wanted to make the\n+timestamp and level bold, since this message would be using discord markdown, we can just add \\*\\* to both sides of\n+level and timestamp. Then once you've done that, just do `/ess reload` and you should see your changes on discord.\n+> ![Bold Format](https://i.imgur.com/jD9mH14.gif)\n+\n+5. Next, you can also configure the name you wish the to show above console messages. By default, it's \"EssX Console\n+Relay\" but can be switched to anything you want.\n+> ![Change Name](https://i.imgur.com/xtrt1Jt.gif)\n+\n+6. Finally, you can also choose to enable an option to treat any message by a user in the console channel as a\n+console command. This will mean that anyone who can send messages in your console channel **will be able to execute \n+commands as the console**. It is suggested that you stick to the regular `/execute` command \n+(see [Discord Commands](#discord-commands)) as those can be restricted to specific roles/users and are also not\n+restricted to the console channel.\n+> ![Command Relay](https://i.imgur.com/w3cfVUw.gif)\n+\n+7. That's all the options for the command relay!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Configuring Messages\n+EssentialsXDiscord aims to keep its message-type system basic enough that simple things take little changes, while\n+giving more fine grain control to those you want it.\n+\n+To give you a general overview of the system, EssentialsXDiscord allows you to define different channel IDs in the\n+`channels` section of the config. By default, two channels are pre-populated in the `channels` section, `primary`\n+and `staff`. If you only completed the initial setup, the `staff` channel definition is all zeros. This is fine in\n+most situations however, as the message system will always fallback to the `primary` channel if a channel ID is\n+invalid.\n+\n+Now on the to the types of messages you can receive themselves (which is where you're going to use these channel \n+definitions). In the `message-types` section of the config, you can see a list of message types (join/leave/chat/etc)\n+on the left (as the key), and on the right there is a channel definition.\n+\n+For the sake of example lets say we want to send all chat messages to their own channel. We can do this by creating\n+a new channel definition and setting the `chat` message type to said channel definition. Below are step-by-step \n+instructions for said example, you can follow along to get the gist of how to apply this to other use cases\n+\n+1. Find the channel on discord you want to only send chat messages to and then right click the channel and click\n+\"Copy ID\".\n+> ![Copy ID](https://i.imgur.com/ri7NZkD.gif)\n+\n+2. Next you need to create the actual channel definition, for this example we'll call it `chat`. You create a\n+channel definition by adding a new entry to the `channels` section with the key as its name and the id as the one\n+you copied in the last step.\n+> ![New Def](https://i.imgur.com/dc7kIkl.gif)\n+\n+3. Finally, scroll down to the `message-types` section and change the `chat` message type to your newly created\n+channel definition. Once you do that, save and either run `/ess reload` if your server is running or start your\n+server.\n+> ![Move](https://i.imgur.com/qPVWkWF.gif)\n+\n+4. That's all you need to know about the basics of the message system!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Receive Discord Messages in Minecraft\n+After reading the [configuring messages section](#configuring-messages), you should now have a few discord\n+channels defined in the `channels` of your config. You're probably wondering how you can let your players start\n+to see messages from discord in minecraft chat. Say I defined a channel named `chat` in the `channels` section\n+of your config, and I wanted to let players see discord messages from that channel in minecraft chat; This can\n+be accomplished very simply by giving players the `essentials.discord.receive.chat` permission. This would relay\n+all discord messages from the `chat` channel to players with that permission. Another example: say I have a staff\n+channel in discord that I want only staff members in the minecraft server to see. Provided there is a `staff`\n+channel defined in the `channels` section of the config, I can give staff members the\n+`essentials.discord.receive.staff` permission, and they will start to see messages from that channel.\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Discord Commands\n+EssentialsXDiscord uses Discord's slash command system to let you type commands into discord without it being\n+seen by other people in the server. With this system, you are able to execute console commands, message players,\n+and see the current player list.\n+\n+For example, here's what the `/execute` command looks like by default:\n+> ![/execute](https://i.imgur.com/yPN22bV.gif)\n+\n+As you can see, you can seamlessly run commands without people seeing the content of your commands or their\n+response. Additionally, you can also delete the responses once you're done looking at them, so they don't clutter\n+your chat.\n+\n+However, this is all configurable! In the `commands` section of the config, lies a ton of options to configure\n+settings on a per-command basis. Below are explanations of what all the configuration options mean and how to use\n+them.\n+\n+* `enabled`\n+  * Default: `true`\n+  * Description: `Whether or not the command should be enabled and therefore shown on discord. Note that you\n+    must restart your minecraft server before this option takes effect.`\n+* `hide-command`\n+  * Default: `true`\n+  * Description: `Whether other people should not be able to see what commands you execute. Setting to false\n+    would allow people in the same channel as you to see exactly what command you execute. In the example below,\n+    you can see how disabling this option shows a message of the user and the command they executed.`\n+  * Example: ![Show Command](https://i.imgur.com/Q61iP4n.gif)\n+* `allowed-roles`\n+  * Description: `A list of user ids or role names/ids that are allowed to use the command. You can also use '*'\n+    in order to allow everyone to use the command.`\n+* `admin-roles`\n+  * `A list of user ids or role names/ids that have extra features in the command. For example, in the list\n+    command, admin-roles allows people to see vanished players.`\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Misc Permissions\n+EssentialsXDiscord has a few miscellanies permissions that may be important to know about;\n+\n+* `essentials.discord.markdown` - Allows players to bypass the markdown filter, so that they can \n+bold/underline/italic/etc their minecraft chat messages for discord.\n+* `essentials.discord.ping` - Allows players to bypass the ping filter, so that they can ping @everyone/@here\n+from minecraft chat.\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Developer API\n+EssentialsXDiscord has a pretty extensive API which allows any third party plugin to build\n+their own integrations into it. Outside the specific examples below, you can also view\n+javadocs for EssentialsXDiscord [here](https://jd-v2.essentialsx.net/EssentialsDiscord).\n+\n+### Sending Messages to Discord\n+EssentialsXDiscord organizes the types of messages that can be sent along with their \n+destination on discord under the `message-types` section of the `config.yml`.

Before starting your server, there are a few steps you have to take. First, you must create a new\n+discord bot at [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).\n+\n+1. Once on that page, click on \"New Application\" button on the top right, give your bot a name, and\n+then click \"Create\".\n+> ![Creating Application](https://i.imgur.com/8ffp4R1.gif)\n+> `New Application` -> Give Application a Name -> `Create`\n+\n+2. Once you create the application, you'll be directed to its overview. From this screen, you'll\n+need to copy your \"Client ID\" and save it for a later step. To copy your client id, click the\n+upper-left most blue \"Copy\" button. Make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Copy Client ID](https://i.imgur.com/W3OMTu5.gif)\n+> `Copy` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+3. Optionally, you can set an icon for your application as it will be the icon for the bot too.\n+> ![Avatar](https://i.imgur.com/NuFS9kT.png)\n+\n+4. The next step is actually creating a bot user for your application. From the overview screen,\n+this is done by going to the \"Bot\" tab on the left, then clicking the \"Add Bot\" on the right,\n+and finally then clicking \"Yes, do it!\".\n+> ![Create Bot](https://i.imgur.com/S14iAFS.gif)\n+> `Bot` -> `Add Bot` -> `Yes, do it!`\n+\n+5. Once on this screen, you'll need to uncheck the \"Public Bot\" setting and then click \"Save Changes\",\n+so other people can't add your bot to servers that are not your own.\n+> ![Disable Public Bot](https://i.imgur.com/HHqWvQ1.gif)\n+> Uncheck `Public Bot` -> `Save Changes`\n+\n+6. Finally, you'll need to copy your bot's token and save it for a later step. To copy your bot's token,\n+click the blue \"Copy\" button right of your bot's icon. Make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Copy Token](https://i.imgur.com/OqpaSQH.gif)\n+> `Copy` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+   \n+7. Next up is adding your bot to your discord server. First, goto [essentialsx.net/discord.html](https://essentialsx.net/discord.html)\n+and paste your Client ID you copied from step 2 into the text box on that page. Once you do that, click\n+the \"Authorize\" button next to the text box. This will redirect you to Discord's authorization website \n+to chose which server to add the bot to. Note for advanced users: Please use the `essentialsx.net` website above \n+even if you think you already know how to invite bots. Bots for EssentialsXDiscord require more than just the `bot`\n+scope to work, so please just use the link above even if you think you know what you're doing.\n+> ![OAuth Link Gen](https://i.imgur.com/u6MFJgQ.gif)\n+> Paste Client ID -> `Authorize`\n+\n+8. Once on the Discord authorization website, select the server from the \"Select a server\" dropdown \n+that you want to add the bot to. Then click the \"Authorize\" button. You may be prompted to confirm\n+you are not a bot, proceed with that like you would any other captcha.\n+> ![Authorize](https://i.imgur.com/KXkESqC.gif)\n+> Select Server -> `Authorize`\n+\n+9. For the next few steps, you're going to need to do some stuff in discord, so start up your\n+Discord desktop/web client. \n+\n+10. Once in your Discord client, you'll need to enable developer mode. Do this by going into the \n+Settings, then go to the \"Appearance\" tab and check on the \"Developer Mode\" at the bottom of the\n+page. Once you've checked \"Developer Mode\" on, click the `X` at the top right to exit Settings.\n+> ![Developer Mode](https://i.imgur.com/CrW31Up.gif)\n+> `User Settings` -> `Appearance` -> Check `Developer Mode` -> Exit Settings\n+\n+11. Next is copying a few IDs. First up, you'll want to copy the server (aka guild) id. Do this by\n+finding the server you added the bot to, right click its icon, and click \"Copy ID\". Once you copied\n+it, make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Guild ID](https://i.imgur.com/0mg2yT3.gif)\n+> Right click server -> `Copy ID` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+12. The other ID you need to copy is the ID of the channel you wish to be your primary channel.\n+In other words, this will be the channel that, by default, receives messages for player chat/join/leave/death\n+messages as well as mute/kicks. To see how to further configure message types, see [Configuring Messages](#configuring-messages).\n+> ![Primary Channel ID](https://i.imgur.com/uMODfiQ.gif)\n+> Right click your 'primary' channel -> `Copy ID` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+13. You've successfully copied all the necessary IDs needed for a basic setup. Next up is generating the\n+default config for EssentialsXDiscord, so you can start setting it up! Do this by putting the\n+EssentialsXDiscord jar (you can download it [here](https://essentialsx.net/downloads.html) if you do not\n+already have one) in your plugins folder, starting your server, and then stopping it as soon as it finishes\n+starting up.\n+> ![Start/Stop Server](https://i.imgur.com/JQX6hqM.gif)\n+> Drag EssentialsXDiscord jar into plugins folder -> Start Server -> Stop Server\n+\n+14. Now you can start to configure the plugin with all the stuff you copied from earlier. Open the config\n+for EssentialsXDiscord located at `plugins/EssentialsDiscord/config.yml`. When you open the config, the\n+first thing to configure is your bot's token. Replace `INSERT-TOKEN-HERE` in the config with the token you\n+copied earlier from step 6.\n+> ![Paste Token](https://i.imgur.com/EnD31Wg.gif)\n+> Re-Copy Token from Step 6 -> Paste as token value \n+\n+15. Next, is the guild id, replace the zeros for the guild value in the config with the guild id you copied\n+from step 13.\n+> ![Paste Guild](https://i.imgur.com/YxkHykd.gif)\n+\n+16. Finally, you'll need to paste the primary channel id you copied from step 14 and paste it as the\n+primary value in the channels section and once you've done that save the config file!\n+> ![Paste Primary](https://i.imgur.com/4xaHMfO.gif)\n+\n+17.

Before starting your server, there are a few steps you have to take. First, you must create a new\n+discord bot at [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).\n+\n+1. Once on that page, click on \"New Application\" button on the top right, give your bot a name, and\n+then click \"Create\".\n+> ![Creating Application](https://i.imgur.com/8ffp4R1.gif)\n+> `New Application` -> Give Application a Name -> `Create`\n+\n+2. Once you create the application, you'll be directed to its overview. From this screen, you'll\n+need to copy your \"Client ID\" and save it for a later step. To copy your client id, click the\n+upper-left most blue \"Copy\" button. Make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Copy Client ID](https://i.imgur.com/W3OMTu5.gif)\n+> `Copy` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+3. Optionally, you can set an icon for your application as it will be the icon for the bot too.\n+> ![Avatar](https://i.imgur.com/NuFS9kT.png)\n+\n+4. The next step is actually creating a bot user for your application. From the overview screen,\n+this is done by going to the \"Bot\" tab on the left, then clicking the \"Add Bot\" on the right,\n+and finally then clicking \"Yes, do it!\".\n+> ![Create Bot](https://i.imgur.com/S14iAFS.gif)\n+> `Bot` -> `Add Bot` -> `Yes, do it!`\n+\n+5. Once on this screen, you'll need to uncheck the \"Public Bot\" setting and then click \"Save Changes\",\n+so other people can't add your bot to servers that are not your own.\n+> ![Disable Public Bot](https://i.imgur.com/HHqWvQ1.gif)\n+> Uncheck `Public Bot` -> `Save Changes`\n+\n+6. Finally, you'll need to copy your bot's token and save it for a later step. To copy your bot's token,\n+click the blue \"Copy\" button right of your bot's icon. Make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Copy Token](https://i.imgur.com/OqpaSQH.gif)\n+> `Copy` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+   \n+7. Next up is adding your bot to your discord server. First, goto [essentialsx.net/discord.html](https://essentialsx.net/discord.html)\n+and paste your Client ID you copied from step 2 into the text box on that page. Once you do that, click\n+the \"Authorize\" button next to the text box. This will redirect you to Discord's authorization website \n+to chose which server to add the bot to. Note for advanced users: Please use the `essentialsx.net` website above \n+even if you think you already know how to invite bots. Bots for EssentialsXDiscord require more than just the `bot`\n+scope to work, so please just use the link above even if you think you know what you're doing.\n+> ![OAuth Link Gen](https://i.imgur.com/u6MFJgQ.gif)\n+> Paste Client ID -> `Authorize`\n+\n+8. Once on the Discord authorization website, select the server from the \"Select a server\" dropdown \n+that you want to add the bot to. Then click the \"Authorize\" button. You may be prompted to confirm\n+you are not a bot, proceed with that like you would any other captcha.\n+> ![Authorize](https://i.imgur.com/KXkESqC.gif)\n+> Select Server -> `Authorize`\n+\n+9. For the next few steps, you're going to need to do some stuff in discord, so start up your\n+Discord desktop/web client. \n+\n+10. Once in your Discord client, you'll need to enable developer mode. Do this by going into the \n+Settings, then go to the \"Appearance\" tab and check on the \"Developer Mode\" at the bottom of the\n+page. Once you've checked \"Developer Mode\" on, click the `X` at the top right to exit Settings.\n+> ![Developer Mode](https://i.imgur.com/CrW31Up.gif)\n+> `User Settings` -> `Appearance` -> Check `Developer Mode` -> Exit Settings\n+\n+11. Next is copying a few IDs. First up, you'll want to copy the server (aka guild) id. Do this by\n+finding the server you added the bot to, right click its icon, and click \"Copy ID\". Once you copied\n+it, make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Guild ID](https://i.imgur.com/0mg2yT3.gif)\n+> Right click server -> `Copy ID` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+12. The other ID you need to copy is the ID of the channel you wish to be your primary channel.\n+In other words, this will be the channel that, by default, receives messages for player chat/join/leave/death\n+messages as well as mute/kicks. To see how to further configure message types, see [Configuring Messages](#configuring-messages).\n+> ![Primary Channel ID](https://i.imgur.com/uMODfiQ.gif)\n+> Right click your 'primary' channel -> `Copy ID` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+13. You've successfully copied all the necessary IDs needed for a basic setup. Next up is generating the\n+default config for EssentialsXDiscord, so you can start setting it up! Do this by putting the\n+EssentialsXDiscord jar (you can download it [here](https://essentialsx.net/downloads.html) if you do not\n+already have one) in your plugins folder, starting your server, and then stopping it as soon as it finishes\n+starting up.\n+> ![Start/Stop Server](https://i.imgur.com/JQX6hqM.gif)\n+> Drag EssentialsXDiscord jar into plugins folder -> Start Server -> Stop Server\n+\n+14. Now you can start to configure the plugin with all the stuff you copied from earlier. Open the config\n+for EssentialsXDiscord located at `plugins/EssentialsDiscord/config.yml`. When you open the config, the\n+first thing to configure is your bot's token. Replace `INSERT-TOKEN-HERE` in the config with the token you\n+copied earlier from step 6.\n+> ![Paste Token](https://i.imgur.com/EnD31Wg.gif)\n+> Re-Copy Token from Step 6 -> Paste as token value \n+\n+15. Next, is the guild id, replace the zeros for the guild value in the config with the guild id you copied\n+from step 13.\n+> ![Paste Guild](https://i.imgur.com/YxkHykd.gif)\n+\n+16. Finally, you'll need to paste the primary channel id you copied from step 14 and paste it as the\n+primary value in the channels section and once you've done that save the config file!\n+> ![Paste Primary](https://i.imgur.com/4xaHMfO.gif)\n+\n+17. Congratulations, you've completed the initial setup guide! When you start up your server, you should\n+notice that chat and other messages start showing up in the channel you requested they be. Now that you\n+completed the initial, go back up to the [Table Of Contents](#table-of-contents) to see what other cool things you can do!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Console Relay\n+The console relay is pretty self-explanatory: it relays everything on your console into discord channel of\n+your choosing. The console relay is ridiculously easy to setup and if your server is already running, you don't\n+need to reload it!\n+\n+0. This assumes you've already done the initial setup.\n+\n+1. Go to the discord server that your bot is in and find the channel you wish to use for console output.\n+Right click on the channel and click \"Copy ID\". Save this id for the next step.\n+> ![Copy ID](https://i.imgur.com/qvDfSLv.gif)\n+> Find console channel -> Right Click -> `Copy ID`\n+\n+2. Now that you have that copied, open the EssentialsXDiscord config and find the `console` section. In that\n+section, replace the zeros for the `channel` value with the channel id you copied from the last step. Once\n+you paste it, make sure you save the config.\n+> ![Paste ID](https://i.imgur.com/NicdpGw.gif)\n+\n+3. Finally, if your server is running, run `ess reload` from your console, otherwise start up your server. You\n+should notice console output being directed to that channel! That is all you need if you're okay with the default\n+settings. Otherwise, if you'd like to see what other options you can use to customize console output, stick around.\n+\n+4. The first thing you can customize is the format of the message sent to discord. By default, the timestamp,\n+level (info/warn/error/etc), and message are shown for each console message. Let's say you wanted to make the\n+timestamp and level bold, since this message would be using discord markdown, we can just add \\*\\* to both sides of\n+level and timestamp. Then once you've done that, just do `/ess reload` and you should see your changes on discord.\n+> ![Bold Format](https://i.imgur.com/jD9mH14.gif)\n+\n+5. Next, you can also configure the name you wish the to show above console messages. By default, it's \"EssX Console\n+Relay\" but can be switched to anything you want.\n+> ![Change Name](https://i.imgur.com/xtrt1Jt.gif)\n+\n+6. Finally, you can also choose to enable an option to treat any message by a user in the console channel as a\n+console command. This will mean that anyone who can send messages in your console channel **will be able to execute \n+commands as the console**. It is suggested that you stick to the regular `/execute` command \n+(see [Discord Commands](#discord-commands)) as those can be restricted to specific roles/users and are also not\n+restricted to the console channel.\n+> ![Command Relay](https://i.imgur.com/w3cfVUw.gif)\n+\n+7. That's all the options for the command relay!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Configuring Messages\n+EssentialsXDiscord aims to keep its message-type system basic enough that simple things take little changes, while\n+giving more fine grain control to those you want it.\n+\n+To give you a general overview of the system, EssentialsXDiscord allows you to define different channel IDs in the\n+`channels` section of the config. By default, two channels are pre-populated in the `channels` section, `primary`\n+and `staff`. If you only completed the initial setup, the `staff` channel definition is all zeros. This is fine in\n+most situations however, as the message system will always fallback to the `primary` channel if a channel ID is\n+invalid.\n+\n+Now on the to the types of messages you can receive themselves (which is where you're going to use these channel \n+definitions). In the `message-types` section of the config, you can see a list of message types (join/leave/chat/etc)\n+on the left (as the key), and on the right there is a channel definition.\n+\n+For the sake of example lets say we want to send all chat messages to their own channel. We can do this by creating\n+a new channel definition and setting the `chat` message type to said channel definition. Below are step-by-step \n+instructions for said example, you can follow along to get the gist of how to apply this to other use cases\n+\n+1. Find the channel on discord you want to only send chat messages to and then right click the channel and click\n+\"Copy ID\".\n+> ![Copy ID](https://i.imgur.com/ri7NZkD.gif)\n+\n+2. Next you need to create the actual channel definition, for this example we'll call it `chat`. You create a\n+channel definition by adding a new entry to the `channels` section with the key as its name and the id as the one\n+you copied in the last step.\n+> ![New Def](https://i.imgur.com/dc7kIkl.gif)\n+\n+3. Finally, scroll down to the `message-types` section and change the `chat` message type to your newly created\n+channel definition. Once you do that, save and either run `/ess reload` if your server is running or start your\n+server.\n+> ![Move](https://i.imgur.com/qPVWkWF.gif)\n+\n+4. That's all you need to know about the basics of the message system!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Receive Discord Messages in Minecraft\n+After reading the [configuring messages section](#configuring-messages), you should now have a few discord\n+channels defined in the `channels` of your config. You're probably wondering how you can let your players start\n+to see messages from discord in minecraft chat. Say I defined a channel named `chat` in the `channels` section\n+of your config, and I wanted to let players see discord messages from that channel in minecraft chat; This can\n+be accomplished very simply by giving players the `essentials.discord.receive.chat` permission. This would relay\n+all discord messages from the `chat` channel to players with that permission. Another example: say I have a staff\n+channel in discord that I want only staff members in the minecraft server to see. Provided there is a `staff`\n+channel defined in the `channels` section of the config, I can give staff members the\n+`essentials.discord.receive.staff` permission, and they will start to see messages from that channel.\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Discord Commands\n+EssentialsXDiscord uses Discord's slash command system to let you type commands into discord without it being\n+seen by other people in the server. With this system, you are able to execute console commands, message players,\n+and see the current player list.\n+\n+For example, here's what the `/execute` command looks like by default:\n+> ![/execute](https://i.imgur.com/yPN22bV.gif)\n+\n+As you can see, you can seamlessly run commands without people seeing the content of your commands or their\n+response. Additionally, you can also delete the responses once you're done looking at them, so they don't clutter\n+your chat.\n+\n+However, this is all configurable! In the `commands` section of the config, lies a ton of options to configure\n+settings on a per-command basis. Below are explanations of what all the configuration options mean and how to use\n+them.\n+\n+* `enabled`\n+  * Default: `true`\n+  * Description: `Whether or not the command should be enabled and therefore shown on discord. Note that you\n+    must restart your minecraft server before this option takes effect.`\n+* `hide-command`\n+  * Default: `true`\n+  * Description: `Whether other people should not be able to see what commands you execute. Setting to false\n+    would allow people in the same channel as you to see exactly what command you execute. In the example below,\n+    you can see how disabling this option shows a message of the user and the command they executed.`\n+  * Example: ![Show Command](https://i.imgur.com/Q61iP4n.gif)\n+* `allowed-roles`\n+  * Description: `A list of user ids or role names/ids that are allowed to use the command. You can also use '*'\n+    in order to allow everyone to use the command.`\n+* `admin-roles`\n+  * `A list of user ids or role names/ids that have extra features in the command. For example, in the list\n+    command, admin-roles allows people to see vanished players.`\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Misc Permissions\n+EssentialsXDiscord has a few miscellanies permissions that may be important to know about;\n+\n+* `essentials.discord.markdown` - Allows players to bypass the markdown filter, so that they can \n+bold/underline/italic/etc their minecraft chat messages for discord.\n+* `essentials.discord.ping` - Allows players to bypass the ping filter, so that they can ping @everyone/@here\n+from minecraft chat.\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Developer API\n+EssentialsXDiscord has a pretty extensive API which allows any third party plugin to build\n+their own integrations into it. Outside the specific examples below, you can also view\n+javadocs for EssentialsXDiscord [here](https://jd-v2.essentialsx.net/EssentialsDiscord).\n+\n+### Sending Messages to Discord\n+EssentialsXDiscord organizes the types of messages that can be sent along with their \n+destination on discord under the `message-types` section of the `config.yml`.

Congratulations, you've completed the initial setup guide! When you start up your server, you should\n+notice that chat and other messages start showing up in the channel you requested they be. Now that you\n+completed the initial, go back up to the [Table Of Contents](#table-of-contents) to see what other cool things you can do!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Console Relay\n+The console relay is pretty self-explanatory: it relays everything on your console into discord channel of\n+your choosing. The console relay is ridiculously easy to setup and if your server is already running, you don't\n+need to reload it!\n+\n+0. This assumes you've already done the initial setup.\n+\n+1. Go to the discord server that your bot is in and find the channel you wish to use for console output.\n+Right click on the channel and click \"Copy ID\". Save this id for the next step.\n+> ![Copy ID](https://i.imgur.com/qvDfSLv.gif)\n+> Find console channel -> Right Click -> `Copy ID`\n+\n+2. Now that you have that copied, open the EssentialsXDiscord config and find the `console` section. In that\n+section, replace the zeros for the `channel` value with the channel id you copied from the last step. Once\n+you paste it, make sure you save the config.\n+> ![Paste ID](https://i.imgur.com/NicdpGw.gif)\n+\n+3. Finally, if your server is running, run `ess reload` from your console, otherwise start up your server. You\n+should notice console output being directed to that channel! That is all you need if you're okay with the default\n+settings. Otherwise, if you'd like to see what other options you can use to customize console output, stick around.\n+\n+4. The first thing you can customize is the format of the message sent to discord. By default, the timestamp,\n+level (info/warn/error/etc), and message are shown for each console message. Let's say you wanted to make the\n+timestamp and level bold, since this message would be using discord markdown, we can just add \\*\\* to both sides of\n+level and timestamp. Then once you've done that, just do `/ess reload` and you should see your changes on discord.\n+> ![Bold Format](https://i.imgur.com/jD9mH14.gif)\n+\n+5. Next, you can also configure the name you wish the to show above console messages. By default, it's \"EssX Console\n+Relay\" but can be switched to anything you want.\n+> ![Change Name](https://i.imgur.com/xtrt1Jt.gif)\n+\n+6. Finally, you can also choose to enable an option to treat any message by a user in the console channel as a\n+console command. This will mean that anyone who can send messages in your console channel **will be able to execute \n+commands as the console**. It is suggested that you stick to the regular `/execute` command \n+(see [Discord Commands](#discord-commands)) as those can be restricted to specific roles/users and are also not\n+restricted to the console channel.\n+> ![Command Relay](https://i.imgur.com/w3cfVUw.gif)\n+\n+7. That's all the options for the command relay!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Configuring Messages\n+EssentialsXDiscord aims to keep its message-type system basic enough that simple things take little changes, while\n+giving more fine grain control to those you want it.\n+\n+To give you a general overview of the system, EssentialsXDiscord allows you to define different channel IDs in the\n+`channels` section of the config. By default, two channels are pre-populated in the `channels` section, `primary`\n+and `staff`. If you only completed the initial setup, the `staff` channel definition is all zeros. This is fine in\n+most situations however, as the message system will always fallback to the `primary` channel if a channel ID is\n+invalid.\n+\n+Now on the to the types of messages you can receive themselves (which is where you're going to use these channel \n+definitions). In the `message-types` section of the config, you can see a list of message types (join/leave/chat/etc)\n+on the left (as the key), and on the right there is a channel definition.\n+\n+For the sake of example lets say we want to send all chat messages to their own channel. We can do this by creating\n+a new channel definition and setting the `chat` message type to said channel definition. Below are step-by-step \n+instructions for said example, you can follow along to get the gist of how to apply this to other use cases\n+\n+1. Find the channel on discord you want to only send chat messages to and then right click the channel and click\n+\"Copy ID\".\n+> ![Copy ID](https://i.imgur.com/ri7NZkD.gif)\n+\n+2. Next you need to create the actual channel definition, for this example we'll call it `chat`. You create a\n+channel definition by adding a new entry to the `channels` section with the key as its name and the id as the one\n+you copied in the last step.\n+> ![New Def](https://i.imgur.com/dc7kIkl.gif)\n+\n+3. Finally, scroll down to the `message-types` section and change the `chat` message type to your newly created\n+channel definition. Once you do that, save and either run `/ess reload` if your server is running or start your\n+server.\n+> ![Move](https://i.imgur.com/qPVWkWF.gif)\n+\n+4. That's all you need to know about the basics of the message system!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Receive Discord Messages in Minecraft\n+After reading the [configuring messages section](#configuring-messages), you should now have a few discord\n+channels defined in the `channels` of your config. You're probably wondering how you can let your players start\n+to see messages from discord in minecraft chat. Say I defined a channel named `chat` in the `channels` section\n+of your config, and I wanted to let players see discord messages from that channel in minecraft chat; This can\n+be accomplished very simply by giving players the `essentials.discord.receive.chat` permission. This would relay\n+all discord messages from the `chat` channel to players with that permission. Another example: say I have a staff\n+channel in discord that I want only staff members in the minecraft server to see. Provided there is a `staff`\n+channel defined in the `channels` section of the config, I can give staff members the\n+`essentials.discord.receive.staff` permission, and they will start to see messages from that channel.\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Discord Commands\n+EssentialsXDiscord uses Discord's slash command system to let you type commands into discord without it being\n+seen by other people in the server. With this system, you are able to execute console commands, message players,\n+and see the current player list.\n+\n+For example, here's what the `/execute` command looks like by default:\n+> ![/execute](https://i.imgur.com/yPN22bV.gif)\n+\n+As you can see, you can seamlessly run commands without people seeing the content of your commands or their\n+response. Additionally, you can also delete the responses once you're done looking at them, so they don't clutter\n+your chat.\n+\n+However, this is all configurable! In the `commands` section of the config, lies a ton of options to configure\n+settings on a per-command basis. Below are explanations of what all the configuration options mean and how to use\n+them.\n+\n+* `enabled`\n+  * Default: `true`\n+  * Description: `Whether or not the command should be enabled and therefore shown on discord. Note that you\n+    must restart your minecraft server before this option takes effect.`\n+* `hide-command`\n+  * Default: `true`\n+  * Description: `Whether other people should not be able to see what commands you execute. Setting to false\n+    would allow people in the same channel as you to see exactly what command you execute.

Outside the specific examples below, you can also view\n+javadocs for EssentialsXDiscord [here](https://jd-v2.essentialsx.net/EssentialsDiscord).\n+\n+### Sending Messages to Discord\n+EssentialsXDiscord organizes the types of messages that can be sent along with their \n+destination on discord under the `message-types` section of the `config.yml`. The \n+EssentialsXDiscord API uses `message-types` to resolve the channel id you want to send your\n+message to.\n+\n+#### Using a built-in message channel\n+EssentialsXDiscord defines a few built in `message-types` which you may fit your use case\n+already (such as sending a message to the mc->discord chat relay channel). The list of \n+built-in message types can be found at [`DiscordMessageEvent.MessageType.DefaultTypes`](https://github.com/EssentialsX/Essentials/blob/2.x/EssentialsDiscord/src/main/java/net/essentialsx/api/v2/events/discord/DiscordMessageEvent.java#L195-L203).\n+\n+Here is an example of what sending a message to the built-in chat channel would look like:", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDY1OTIyOTUwNQ=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "99a4b3ab018d821d7dc3e6713b3099f05db6ff73"}, "originalPosition": 282}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkNDE4NjY4OTM0OnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "EssentialsDiscord/README.md", "isResolved": true, "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMS0wNi0yNlQyMjoxMjo0N1rOJ0sLig==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMS0wNi0yNlQyMjoxMjo0N1rOJ0sLig==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDY1OTIyOTU3OA==", "bodyText": "This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

Before starting your server, there are a few steps you have to take. First, you must create a new\n+discord bot at [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).\n+\n+1. Once on that page, click on \"New Application\" button on the top right, give your bot a name, and\n+then click \"Create\".\n+> ![Creating Application](https://i.imgur.com/8ffp4R1.gif)\n+> `New Application` -> Give Application a Name -> `Create`\n+\n+2. Once you create the application, you'll be directed to its overview. From this screen, you'll\n+need to copy your \"Client ID\" and save it for a later step. To copy your client id, click the\n+upper-left most blue \"Copy\" button. Make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Copy Client ID](https://i.imgur.com/W3OMTu5.gif)\n+> `Copy` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+3. Optionally, you can set an icon for your application as it will be the icon for the bot too.\n+> ![Avatar](https://i.imgur.com/NuFS9kT.png)\n+\n+4. The next step is actually creating a bot user for your application. From the overview screen,\n+this is done by going to the \"Bot\" tab on the left, then clicking the \"Add Bot\" on the right,\n+and finally then clicking \"Yes, do it!\".\n+> ![Create Bot](https://i.imgur.com/S14iAFS.gif)\n+> `Bot` -> `Add Bot` -> `Yes, do it!`\n+\n+5. Once on this screen, you'll need to uncheck the \"Public Bot\" setting and then click \"Save Changes\",\n+so other people can't add your bot to servers that are not your own.\n+> ![Disable Public Bot](https://i.imgur.com/HHqWvQ1.gif)\n+> Uncheck `Public Bot` -> `Save Changes`\n+\n+6. Finally, you'll need to copy your bot's token and save it for a later step. To copy your bot's token,\n+click the blue \"Copy\" button right of your bot's icon. Make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Copy Token](https://i.imgur.com/OqpaSQH.gif)\n+> `Copy` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+   \n+7. Next up is adding your bot to your discord server. First, goto [essentialsx.net/discord.html](https://essentialsx.net/discord.html)\n+and paste your Client ID you copied from step 2 into the text box on that page. Once you do that, click\n+the \"Authorize\" button next to the text box. This will redirect you to Discord's authorization website \n+to chose which server to add the bot to. Note for advanced users: Please use the `essentialsx.net` website above \n+even if you think you already know how to invite bots. Bots for EssentialsXDiscord require more than just the `bot`\n+scope to work, so please just use the link above even if you think you know what you're doing.\n+> ![OAuth Link Gen](https://i.imgur.com/u6MFJgQ.gif)\n+> Paste Client ID -> `Authorize`\n+\n+8. Once on the Discord authorization website, select the server from the \"Select a server\" dropdown \n+that you want to add the bot to. Then click the \"Authorize\" button. You may be prompted to confirm\n+you are not a bot, proceed with that like you would any other captcha.\n+> ![Authorize](https://i.imgur.com/KXkESqC.gif)\n+> Select Server -> `Authorize`\n+\n+9. For the next few steps, you're going to need to do some stuff in discord, so start up your\n+Discord desktop/web client. \n+\n+10. Once in your Discord client, you'll need to enable developer mode. Do this by going into the \n+Settings, then go to the \"Appearance\" tab and check on the \"Developer Mode\" at the bottom of the\n+page. Once you've checked \"Developer Mode\" on, click the `X` at the top right to exit Settings.\n+> ![Developer Mode](https://i.imgur.com/CrW31Up.gif)\n+> `User Settings` -> `Appearance` -> Check `Developer Mode` -> Exit Settings\n+\n+11. Next is copying a few IDs. First up, you'll want to copy the server (aka guild) id. Do this by\n+finding the server you added the bot to, right click its icon, and click \"Copy ID\". Once you copied\n+it, make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Guild ID](https://i.imgur.com/0mg2yT3.gif)\n+> Right click server -> `Copy ID` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+12. The other ID you need to copy is the ID of the channel you wish to be your primary channel.\n+In other words, this will be the channel that, by default, receives messages for player chat/join/leave/death\n+messages as well as mute/kicks. To see how to further configure message types, see [Configuring Messages](#configuring-messages).\n+> ![Primary Channel ID](https://i.imgur.com/uMODfiQ.gif)\n+> Right click your 'primary' channel -> `Copy ID` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+13. You've successfully copied all the necessary IDs needed for a basic setup. Next up is generating the\n+default config for EssentialsXDiscord, so you can start setting it up! Do this by putting the\n+EssentialsXDiscord jar (you can download it [here](https://essentialsx.net/downloads.html) if you do not\n+already have one) in your plugins folder, starting your server, and then stopping it as soon as it finishes\n+starting up.\n+> ![Start/Stop Server](https://i.imgur.com/JQX6hqM.gif)\n+> Drag EssentialsXDiscord jar into plugins folder -> Start Server -> Stop Server\n+\n+14. Now you can start to configure the plugin with all the stuff you copied from earlier. Open the config\n+for EssentialsXDiscord located at `plugins/EssentialsDiscord/config.yml`. When you open the config, the\n+first thing to configure is your bot's token. Replace `INSERT-TOKEN-HERE` in the config with the token you\n+copied earlier from step 6.\n+> ![Paste Token](https://i.imgur.com/EnD31Wg.gif)\n+> Re-Copy Token from Step 6 -> Paste as token value \n+\n+15. Next, is the guild id, replace the zeros for the guild value in the config with the guild id you copied\n+from step 13.\n+> ![Paste Guild](https://i.imgur.com/YxkHykd.gif)\n+\n+16. Finally, you'll need to paste the primary channel id you copied from step 14 and paste it as the\n+primary value in the channels section and once you've done that save the config file!\n+> ![Paste Primary](https://i.imgur.com/4xaHMfO.gif)\n+\n+17.

The list of \n+built-in message types can be found at [`DiscordMessageEvent.MessageType.DefaultTypes`](https://github.com/EssentialsX/Essentials/blob/2.x/EssentialsDiscord/src/main/java/net/essentialsx/api/v2/events/discord/DiscordMessageEvent.java#L195-L203).\n+\n+Here is an example of what sending a message to the built-in chat channel would look like:\n+```java\n+// The built in channel you want to send your message to, in this case the chat channel.\n+final MessageType channel = DiscordMessageEvent.MessageType.DefaultTypes.CHAT;\n+// Set to true if your message should be allowed to ping @everyone, @here, or roles.\n+// If you are sending user-generated content, you probably should keep this as false.\n+final boolean allowGroupMentions = false;\n+// Construct and call the actual event\n+final DiscordMessageEvent event = new DiscordMessageEvent(channel, \"My Epic Message\", allowGroupMentions);\n+Bukkit.getPluginManager().callEvent(event);\n+```\n+\n+#### Using your own message channel\n+If you want to create your own message type to allow your users to explicitly separate your\n+messages from our other built-in ones, you can do that also by creating a new\n+[`DiscordMessageEvent.MessageType`](https://github.com/EssentialsX/Essentials/blob/module/discord/EssentialsDiscord/src/main/java/net/essentialsx/api/v2/events/discord/DiscordMessageEvent.java#L159-L161).\n+The key provided in the constructor should be the key you'd like your users to use in the\n+`message-types` section of our config.

Before starting your server, there are a few steps you have to take. First, you must create a new\n+discord bot at [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).\n+\n+1. Once on that page, click on \"New Application\" button on the top right, give your bot a name, and\n+then click \"Create\".\n+> ![Creating Application](https://i.imgur.com/8ffp4R1.gif)\n+> `New Application` -> Give Application a Name -> `Create`\n+\n+2. Once you create the application, you'll be directed to its overview. From this screen, you'll\n+need to copy your \"Client ID\" and save it for a later step. To copy your client id, click the\n+upper-left most blue \"Copy\" button. Make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Copy Client ID](https://i.imgur.com/W3OMTu5.gif)\n+> `Copy` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+3. Optionally, you can set an icon for your application as it will be the icon for the bot too.\n+> ![Avatar](https://i.imgur.com/NuFS9kT.png)\n+\n+4. The next step is actually creating a bot user for your application. From the overview screen,\n+this is done by going to the \"Bot\" tab on the left, then clicking the \"Add Bot\" on the right,\n+and finally then clicking \"Yes, do it!\".\n+> ![Create Bot](https://i.imgur.com/S14iAFS.gif)\n+> `Bot` -> `Add Bot` -> `Yes, do it!`\n+\n+5. Once on this screen, you'll need to uncheck the \"Public Bot\" setting and then click \"Save Changes\",\n+so other people can't add your bot to servers that are not your own.\n+> ![Disable Public Bot](https://i.imgur.com/HHqWvQ1.gif)\n+> Uncheck `Public Bot` -> `Save Changes`\n+\n+6. Finally, you'll need to copy your bot's token and save it for a later step. To copy your bot's token,\n+click the blue \"Copy\" button right of your bot's icon. Make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Copy Token](https://i.imgur.com/OqpaSQH.gif)\n+> `Copy` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+   \n+7. Next up is adding your bot to your discord server. First, goto [essentialsx.net/discord.html](https://essentialsx.net/discord.html)\n+and paste your Client ID you copied from step 2 into the text box on that page. Once you do that, click\n+the \"Authorize\" button next to the text box. This will redirect you to Discord's authorization website \n+to chose which server to add the bot to. Note for advanced users: Please use the `essentialsx.net` website above \n+even if you think you already know how to invite bots. Bots for EssentialsXDiscord require more than just the `bot`\n+scope to work, so please just use the link above even if you think you know what you're doing.\n+> ![OAuth Link Gen](https://i.imgur.com/u6MFJgQ.gif)\n+> Paste Client ID -> `Authorize`\n+\n+8. Once on the Discord authorization website, select the server from the \"Select a server\" dropdown \n+that you want to add the bot to. Then click the \"Authorize\" button. You may be prompted to confirm\n+you are not a bot, proceed with that like you would any other captcha.\n+> ![Authorize](https://i.imgur.com/KXkESqC.gif)\n+> Select Server -> `Authorize`\n+\n+9. For the next few steps, you're going to need to do some stuff in discord, so start up your\n+Discord desktop/web client. \n+\n+10. Once in your Discord client, you'll need to enable developer mode. Do this by going into the \n+Settings, then go to the \"Appearance\" tab and check on the \"Developer Mode\" at the bottom of the\n+page. Once you've checked \"Developer Mode\" on, click the `X` at the top right to exit Settings.\n+> ![Developer Mode](https://i.imgur.com/CrW31Up.gif)\n+> `User Settings` -> `Appearance` -> Check `Developer Mode` -> Exit Settings\n+\n+11. Next is copying a few IDs. First up, you'll want to copy the server (aka guild) id. Do this by\n+finding the server you added the bot to, right click its icon, and click \"Copy ID\". Once you copied\n+it, make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Guild ID](https://i.imgur.com/0mg2yT3.gif)\n+> Right click server -> `Copy ID` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+12. The other ID you need to copy is the ID of the channel you wish to be your primary channel.\n+In other words, this will be the channel that, by default, receives messages for player chat/join/leave/death\n+messages as well as mute/kicks. To see how to further configure message types, see [Configuring Messages](#configuring-messages).\n+> ![Primary Channel ID](https://i.imgur.com/uMODfiQ.gif)\n+> Right click your 'primary' channel -> `Copy ID` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+13. You've successfully copied all the necessary IDs needed for a basic setup. Next up is generating the\n+default config for EssentialsXDiscord, so you can start setting it up! Do this by putting the\n+EssentialsXDiscord jar (you can download it [here](https://essentialsx.net/downloads.html) if you do not\n+already have one) in your plugins folder, starting your server, and then stopping it as soon as it finishes\n+starting up.\n+> ![Start/Stop Server](https://i.imgur.com/JQX6hqM.gif)\n+> Drag EssentialsXDiscord jar into plugins folder -> Start Server -> Stop Server\n+\n+14. Now you can start to configure the plugin with all the stuff you copied from earlier. Open the config\n+for EssentialsXDiscord located at `plugins/EssentialsDiscord/config.yml`. When you open the config, the\n+first thing to configure is your bot's token. Replace `INSERT-TOKEN-HERE` in the config with the token you\n+copied earlier from step 6.\n+> ![Paste Token](https://i.imgur.com/EnD31Wg.gif)\n+> Re-Copy Token from Step 6 -> Paste as token value \n+\n+15. Next, is the guild id, replace the zeros for the guild value in the config with the guild id you copied\n+from step 13.\n+> ![Paste Guild](https://i.imgur.com/YxkHykd.gif)\n+\n+16. Finally, you'll need to paste the primary channel id you copied from step 14 and paste it as the\n+primary value in the channels section and once you've done that save the config file!\n+> ![Paste Primary](https://i.imgur.com/4xaHMfO.gif)\n+\n+17. Congratulations, you've completed the initial setup guide! When you start up your server, you should\n+notice that chat and other messages start showing up in the channel you requested they be. Now that you\n+completed the initial, go back up to the [Table Of Contents](#table-of-contents) to see what other cool things you can do!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Console Relay\n+The console relay is pretty self-explanatory: it relays everything on your console into discord channel of\n+your choosing. The console relay is ridiculously easy to setup and if your server is already running, you don't\n+need to reload it!\n+\n+0. This assumes you've already done the initial setup.\n+\n+1. Go to the discord server that your bot is in and find the channel you wish to use for console output.\n+Right click on the channel and click \"Copy ID\". Save this id for the next step.\n+> ![Copy ID](https://i.imgur.com/qvDfSLv.gif)\n+> Find console channel -> Right Click -> `Copy ID`\n+\n+2. Now that you have that copied, open the EssentialsXDiscord config and find the `console` section. In that\n+section, replace the zeros for the `channel` value with the channel id you copied from the last step. Once\n+you paste it, make sure you save the config.\n+> ![Paste ID](https://i.imgur.com/NicdpGw.gif)\n+\n+3. Finally, if your server is running, run `ess reload` from your console, otherwise start up your server. You\n+should notice console output being directed to that channel! That is all you need if you're okay with the default\n+settings. Otherwise, if you'd like to see what other options you can use to customize console output, stick around.\n+\n+4. The first thing you can customize is the format of the message sent to discord. By default, the timestamp,\n+level (info/warn/error/etc), and message are shown for each console message. Let's say you wanted to make the\n+timestamp and level bold, since this message would be using discord markdown, we can just add \\*\\* to both sides of\n+level and timestamp. Then once you've done that, just do `/ess reload` and you should see your changes on discord.\n+> ![Bold Format](https://i.imgur.com/jD9mH14.gif)\n+\n+5. Next, you can also configure the name you wish the to show above console messages. By default, it's \"EssX Console\n+Relay\" but can be switched to anything you want.\n+> ![Change Name](https://i.imgur.com/xtrt1Jt.gif)\n+\n+6. Finally, you can also choose to enable an option to treat any message by a user in the console channel as a\n+console command. This will mean that anyone who can send messages in your console channel **will be able to execute \n+commands as the console**. It is suggested that you stick to the regular `/execute` command \n+(see [Discord Commands](#discord-commands)) as those can be restricted to specific roles/users and are also not\n+restricted to the console channel.\n+> ![Command Relay](https://i.imgur.com/w3cfVUw.gif)\n+\n+7. That's all the options for the command relay!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Configuring Messages\n+EssentialsXDiscord aims to keep its message-type system basic enough that simple things take little changes, while\n+giving more fine grain control to those you want it.\n+\n+To give you a general overview of the system, EssentialsXDiscord allows you to define different channel IDs in the\n+`channels` section of the config. By default, two channels are pre-populated in the `channels` section, `primary`\n+and `staff`. If you only completed the initial setup, the `staff` channel definition is all zeros. This is fine in\n+most situations however, as the message system will always fallback to the `primary` channel if a channel ID is\n+invalid.\n+\n+Now on the to the types of messages you can receive themselves (which is where you're going to use these channel \n+definitions). In the `message-types` section of the config, you can see a list of message types (join/leave/chat/etc)\n+on the left (as the key), and on the right there is a channel definition.\n+\n+For the sake of example lets say we want to send all chat messages to their own channel. We can do this by creating\n+a new channel definition and setting the `chat` message type to said channel definition. Below are step-by-step \n+instructions for said example, you can follow along to get the gist of how to apply this to other use cases\n+\n+1. Find the channel on discord you want to only send chat messages to and then right click the channel and click\n+\"Copy ID\".\n+> ![Copy ID](https://i.imgur.com/ri7NZkD.gif)\n+\n+2. Next you need to create the actual channel definition, for this example we'll call it `chat`. You create a\n+channel definition by adding a new entry to the `channels` section with the key as its name and the id as the one\n+you copied in the last step.\n+> ![New Def](https://i.imgur.com/dc7kIkl.gif)\n+\n+3. Finally, scroll down to the `message-types` section and change the `chat` message type to your newly created\n+channel definition. Once you do that, save and either run `/ess reload` if your server is running or start your\n+server.\n+> ![Move](https://i.imgur.com/qPVWkWF.gif)\n+\n+4. That's all you need to know about the basics of the message system!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Receive Discord Messages in Minecraft\n+After reading the [configuring messages section](#configuring-messages), you should now have a few discord\n+channels defined in the `channels` of your config. You're probably wondering how you can let your players start\n+to see messages from discord in minecraft chat. Say I defined a channel named `chat` in the `channels` section\n+of your config, and I wanted to let players see discord messages from that channel in minecraft chat; This can\n+be accomplished very simply by giving players the `essentials.discord.receive.chat` permission. This would relay\n+all discord messages from the `chat` channel to players with that permission. Another example: say I have a staff\n+channel in discord that I want only staff members in the minecraft server to see. Provided there is a `staff`\n+channel defined in the `channels` section of the config, I can give staff members the\n+`essentials.discord.receive.staff` permission, and they will start to see messages from that channel.\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Discord Commands\n+EssentialsXDiscord uses Discord's slash command system to let you type commands into discord without it being\n+seen by other people in the server. With this system, you are able to execute console commands, message players,\n+and see the current player list.\n+\n+For example, here's what the `/execute` command looks like by default:\n+> ![/execute](https://i.imgur.com/yPN22bV.gif)\n+\n+As you can see, you can seamlessly run commands without people seeing the content of your commands or their\n+response. Additionally, you can also delete the responses once you're done looking at them, so they don't clutter\n+your chat.\n+\n+However, this is all configurable! In the `commands` section of the config, lies a ton of options to configure\n+settings on a per-command basis. Below are explanations of what all the configuration options mean and how to use\n+them.\n+\n+* `enabled`\n+  * Default: `true`\n+  * Description: `Whether or not the command should be enabled and therefore shown on discord. Note that you\n+    must restart your minecraft server before this option takes effect.`\n+* `hide-command`\n+  * Default: `true`\n+  * Description: `Whether other people should not be able to see what commands you execute. Setting to false\n+    would allow people in the same channel as you to see exactly what command you execute. In the example below,\n+    you can see how disabling this option shows a message of the user and the command they executed.`\n+  * Example: ![Show Command](https://i.imgur.com/Q61iP4n.gif)\n+* `allowed-roles`\n+  * Description: `A list of user ids or role names/ids that are allowed to use the command. You can also use '*'\n+    in order to allow everyone to use the command.`\n+* `admin-roles`\n+  * `A list of user ids or role names/ids that have extra features in the command. For example, in the list\n+    command, admin-roles allows people to see vanished players.`\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Misc Permissions\n+EssentialsXDiscord has a few miscellanies permissions that may be important to know about;\n+\n+* `essentials.discord.markdown` - Allows players to bypass the markdown filter, so that they can \n+bold/underline/italic/etc their minecraft chat messages for discord.\n+* `essentials.discord.ping` - Allows players to bypass the ping filter, so that they can ping @everyone/@here\n+from minecraft chat.\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Developer API\n+EssentialsXDiscord has a pretty extensive API which allows any third party plugin to build\n+their own integrations into it. Outside the specific examples below, you can also view\n+javadocs for EssentialsXDiscord [here](https://jd-v2.essentialsx.net/EssentialsDiscord).\n+\n+### Sending Messages to Discord\n+EssentialsXDiscord organizes the types of messages that can be sent along with their \n+destination on discord under the `message-types` section of the `config.yml`.

Before starting your server, there are a few steps you have to take. First, you must create a new\n+discord bot at [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).\n+\n+1. Once on that page, click on \"New Application\" button on the top right, give your bot a name, and\n+then click \"Create\".\n+> ![Creating Application](https://i.imgur.com/8ffp4R1.gif)\n+> `New Application` -> Give Application a Name -> `Create`\n+\n+2. Once you create the application, you'll be directed to its overview. From this screen, you'll\n+need to copy your \"Client ID\" and save it for a later step. To copy your client id, click the\n+upper-left most blue \"Copy\" button. Make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Copy Client ID](https://i.imgur.com/W3OMTu5.gif)\n+> `Copy` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+3. Optionally, you can set an icon for your application as it will be the icon for the bot too.\n+> ![Avatar](https://i.imgur.com/NuFS9kT.png)\n+\n+4. The next step is actually creating a bot user for your application. From the overview screen,\n+this is done by going to the \"Bot\" tab on the left, then clicking the \"Add Bot\" on the right,\n+and finally then clicking \"Yes, do it!\".\n+> ![Create Bot](https://i.imgur.com/S14iAFS.gif)\n+> `Bot` -> `Add Bot` -> `Yes, do it!`\n+\n+5. Once on this screen, you'll need to uncheck the \"Public Bot\" setting and then click \"Save Changes\",\n+so other people can't add your bot to servers that are not your own.\n+> ![Disable Public Bot](https://i.imgur.com/HHqWvQ1.gif)\n+> Uncheck `Public Bot` -> `Save Changes`\n+\n+6. Finally, you'll need to copy your bot's token and save it for a later step. To copy your bot's token,\n+click the blue \"Copy\" button right of your bot's icon. Make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Copy Token](https://i.imgur.com/OqpaSQH.gif)\n+> `Copy` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+   \n+7. Next up is adding your bot to your discord server. First, goto [essentialsx.net/discord.html](https://essentialsx.net/discord.html)\n+and paste your Client ID you copied from step 2 into the text box on that page. Once you do that, click\n+the \"Authorize\" button next to the text box. This will redirect you to Discord's authorization website \n+to chose which server to add the bot to. Note for advanced users: Please use the `essentialsx.net` website above \n+even if you think you already know how to invite bots. Bots for EssentialsXDiscord require more than just the `bot`\n+scope to work, so please just use the link above even if you think you know what you're doing.\n+> ![OAuth Link Gen](https://i.imgur.com/u6MFJgQ.gif)\n+> Paste Client ID -> `Authorize`\n+\n+8. Once on the Discord authorization website, select the server from the \"Select a server\" dropdown \n+that you want to add the bot to. Then click the \"Authorize\" button. You may be prompted to confirm\n+you are not a bot, proceed with that like you would any other captcha.\n+> ![Authorize](https://i.imgur.com/KXkESqC.gif)\n+> Select Server -> `Authorize`\n+\n+9. For the next few steps, you're going to need to do some stuff in discord, so start up your\n+Discord desktop/web client. \n+\n+10. Once in your Discord client, you'll need to enable developer mode. Do this by going into the \n+Settings, then go to the \"Appearance\" tab and check on the \"Developer Mode\" at the bottom of the\n+page. Once you've checked \"Developer Mode\" on, click the `X` at the top right to exit Settings.\n+> ![Developer Mode](https://i.imgur.com/CrW31Up.gif)\n+> `User Settings` -> `Appearance` -> Check `Developer Mode` -> Exit Settings\n+\n+11. Next is copying a few IDs. First up, you'll want to copy the server (aka guild) id. Do this by\n+finding the server you added the bot to, right click its icon, and click \"Copy ID\". Once you copied\n+it, make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Guild ID](https://i.imgur.com/0mg2yT3.gif)\n+> Right click server -> `Copy ID` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+12. The other ID you need to copy is the ID of the channel you wish to be your primary channel.\n+In other words, this will be the channel that, by default, receives messages for player chat/join/leave/death\n+messages as well as mute/kicks. To see how to further configure message types, see [Configuring Messages](#configuring-messages).\n+> ![Primary Channel ID](https://i.imgur.com/uMODfiQ.gif)\n+> Right click your 'primary' channel -> `Copy ID` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+13. You've successfully copied all the necessary IDs needed for a basic setup. Next up is generating the\n+default config for EssentialsXDiscord, so you can start setting it up! Do this by putting the\n+EssentialsXDiscord jar (you can download it [here](https://essentialsx.net/downloads.html) if you do not\n+already have one) in your plugins folder, starting your server, and then stopping it as soon as it finishes\n+starting up.\n+> ![Start/Stop Server](https://i.imgur.com/JQX6hqM.gif)\n+> Drag EssentialsXDiscord jar into plugins folder -> Start Server -> Stop Server\n+\n+14. Now you can start to configure the plugin with all the stuff you copied from earlier. Open the config\n+for EssentialsXDiscord located at `plugins/EssentialsDiscord/config.yml`. When you open the config, the\n+first thing to configure is your bot's token. Replace `INSERT-TOKEN-HERE` in the config with the token you\n+copied earlier from step 6.\n+> ![Paste Token](https://i.imgur.com/EnD31Wg.gif)\n+> Re-Copy Token from Step 6 -> Paste as token value \n+\n+15. Next, is the guild id, replace the zeros for the guild value in the config with the guild id you copied\n+from step 13.\n+> ![Paste Guild](https://i.imgur.com/YxkHykd.gif)\n+\n+16. Finally, you'll need to paste the primary channel id you copied from step 14 and paste it as the\n+primary value in the channels section and once you've done that save the config file!\n+> ![Paste Primary](https://i.imgur.com/4xaHMfO.gif)\n+\n+17. Congratulations, you've completed the initial setup guide! When you start up your server, you should\n+notice that chat and other messages start showing up in the channel you requested they be. Now that you\n+completed the initial, go back up to the [Table Of Contents](#table-of-contents) to see what other cool things you can do!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Console Relay\n+The console relay is pretty self-explanatory: it relays everything on your console into discord channel of\n+your choosing. The console relay is ridiculously easy to setup and if your server is already running, you don't\n+need to reload it!\n+\n+0. This assumes you've already done the initial setup.\n+\n+1. Go to the discord server that your bot is in and find the channel you wish to use for console output.\n+Right click on the channel and click \"Copy ID\". Save this id for the next step.\n+> ![Copy ID](https://i.imgur.com/qvDfSLv.gif)\n+> Find console channel -> Right Click -> `Copy ID`\n+\n+2. Now that you have that copied, open the EssentialsXDiscord config and find the `console` section. In that\n+section, replace the zeros for the `channel` value with the channel id you copied from the last step. Once\n+you paste it, make sure you save the config.\n+> ![Paste ID](https://i.imgur.com/NicdpGw.gif)\n+\n+3. Finally, if your server is running, run `ess reload` from your console, otherwise start up your server. You\n+should notice console output being directed to that channel! That is all you need if you're okay with the default\n+settings. Otherwise, if you'd like to see what other options you can use to customize console output, stick around.\n+\n+4. The first thing you can customize is the format of the message sent to discord. By default, the timestamp,\n+level (info/warn/error/etc), and message are shown for each console message. Let's say you wanted to make the\n+timestamp and level bold, since this message would be using discord markdown, we can just add \\*\\* to both sides of\n+level and timestamp. Then once you've done that, just do `/ess reload` and you should see your changes on discord.\n+> ![Bold Format](https://i.imgur.com/jD9mH14.gif)\n+\n+5. Next, you can also configure the name you wish the to show above console messages. By default, it's \"EssX Console\n+Relay\" but can be switched to anything you want.\n+> ![Change Name](https://i.imgur.com/xtrt1Jt.gif)\n+\n+6. Finally, you can also choose to enable an option to treat any message by a user in the console channel as a\n+console command. This will mean that anyone who can send messages in your console channel **will be able to execute \n+commands as the console**. It is suggested that you stick to the regular `/execute` command \n+(see [Discord Commands](#discord-commands)) as those can be restricted to specific roles/users and are also not\n+restricted to the console channel.\n+> ![Command Relay](https://i.imgur.com/w3cfVUw.gif)\n+\n+7. That's all the options for the command relay!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Configuring Messages\n+EssentialsXDiscord aims to keep its message-type system basic enough that simple things take little changes, while\n+giving more fine grain control to those you want it.\n+\n+To give you a general overview of the system, EssentialsXDiscord allows you to define different channel IDs in the\n+`channels` section of the config. By default, two channels are pre-populated in the `channels` section, `primary`\n+and `staff`. If you only completed the initial setup, the `staff` channel definition is all zeros. This is fine in\n+most situations however, as the message system will always fallback to the `primary` channel if a channel ID is\n+invalid.\n+\n+Now on the to the types of messages you can receive themselves (which is where you're going to use these channel \n+definitions). In the `message-types` section of the config, you can see a list of message types (join/leave/chat/etc)\n+on the left (as the key), and on the right there is a channel definition.\n+\n+For the sake of example lets say we want to send all chat messages to their own channel. We can do this by creating\n+a new channel definition and setting the `chat` message type to said channel definition. Below are step-by-step \n+instructions for said example, you can follow along to get the gist of how to apply this to other use cases\n+\n+1. Find the channel on discord you want to only send chat messages to and then right click the channel and click\n+\"Copy ID\".\n+> ![Copy ID](https://i.imgur.com/ri7NZkD.gif)\n+\n+2. Next you need to create the actual channel definition, for this example we'll call it `chat`. You create a\n+channel definition by adding a new entry to the `channels` section with the key as its name and the id as the one\n+you copied in the last step.\n+> ![New Def](https://i.imgur.com/dc7kIkl.gif)\n+\n+3. Finally, scroll down to the `message-types` section and change the `chat` message type to your newly created\n+channel definition. Once you do that, save and either run `/ess reload` if your server is running or start your\n+server.\n+> ![Move](https://i.imgur.com/qPVWkWF.gif)\n+\n+4. That's all you need to know about the basics of the message system!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Receive Discord Messages in Minecraft\n+After reading the [configuring messages section](#configuring-messages), you should now have a few discord\n+channels defined in the `channels` of your config. You're probably wondering how you can let your players start\n+to see messages from discord in minecraft chat. Say I defined a channel named `chat` in the `channels` section\n+of your config, and I wanted to let players see discord messages from that channel in minecraft chat; This can\n+be accomplished very simply by giving players the `essentials.discord.receive.chat` permission. This would relay\n+all discord messages from the `chat` channel to players with that permission. Another example: say I have a staff\n+channel in discord that I want only staff members in the minecraft server to see. Provided there is a `staff`\n+channel defined in the `channels` section of the config, I can give staff members the\n+`essentials.discord.receive.staff` permission, and they will start to see messages from that channel.\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Discord Commands\n+EssentialsXDiscord uses Discord's slash command system to let you type commands into discord without it being\n+seen by other people in the server. With this system, you are able to execute console commands, message players,\n+and see the current player list.\n+\n+For example, here's what the `/execute` command looks like by default:\n+> ![/execute](https://i.imgur.com/yPN22bV.gif)\n+\n+As you can see, you can seamlessly run commands without people seeing the content of your commands or their\n+response. Additionally, you can also delete the responses once you're done looking at them, so they don't clutter\n+your chat.\n+\n+However, this is all configurable! In the `commands` section of the config, lies a ton of options to configure\n+settings on a per-command basis. Below are explanations of what all the configuration options mean and how to use\n+them.\n+\n+* `enabled`\n+  * Default: `true`\n+  * Description: `Whether or not the command should be enabled and therefore shown on discord. Note that you\n+    must restart your minecraft server before this option takes effect.`\n+* `hide-command`\n+  * Default: `true`\n+  * Description: `Whether other people should not be able to see what commands you execute. Setting to false\n+    would allow people in the same channel as you to see exactly what command you execute. In the example below,\n+    you can see how disabling this option shows a message of the user and the command they executed.`\n+  * Example: ![Show Command](https://i.imgur.com/Q61iP4n.gif)\n+* `allowed-roles`\n+  * Description: `A list of user ids or role names/ids that are allowed to use the command. You can also use '*'\n+    in order to allow everyone to use the command.`\n+* `admin-roles`\n+  * `A list of user ids or role names/ids that have extra features in the command. For example, in the list\n+    command, admin-roles allows people to see vanished players.`\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Misc Permissions\n+EssentialsXDiscord has a few miscellanies permissions that may be important to know about;\n+\n+* `essentials.discord.markdown` - Allows players to bypass the markdown filter, so that they can \n+bold/underline/italic/etc their minecraft chat messages for discord.\n+* `essentials.discord.ping` - Allows players to bypass the ping filter, so that they can ping @everyone/@here\n+from minecraft chat.\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Developer API\n+EssentialsXDiscord has a pretty extensive API which allows any third party plugin to build\n+their own integrations into it. Outside the specific examples below, you can also view\n+javadocs for EssentialsXDiscord [here](https://jd-v2.essentialsx.net/EssentialsDiscord).\n+\n+### Sending Messages to Discord\n+EssentialsXDiscord organizes the types of messages that can be sent along with their \n+destination on discord under the `message-types` section of the `config.yml`. The \n+EssentialsXDiscord API uses `message-types` to resolve the channel id you want to send your\n+message to.\n+\n+#### Using a built-in message channel\n+EssentialsXDiscord defines a few built in `message-types` which you may fit your use case\n+already (such as sending a message to the mc->discord chat relay channel). The list of \n+built-in message types can be found at [`DiscordMessageEvent.MessageType.DefaultTypes`](https://github.com/EssentialsX/Essentials/blob/2.x/EssentialsDiscord/src/main/java/net/essentialsx/api/v2/events/discord/DiscordMessageEvent.java#L195-L203).\n+\n+Here is an example of what sending a message to the built-in chat channel would look like:\n+```java\n+// The built in channel you want to send your message to, in this case the chat channel.\n+final MessageType channel = DiscordMessageEvent.MessageType.DefaultTypes.CHAT;\n+// Set to true if your message should be allowed to ping @everyone, @here, or roles.\n+// If you are sending user-generated content, you probably should keep this as false.\n+final boolean allowGroupMentions = false;\n+// Construct and call the actual event\n+final DiscordMessageEvent event = new DiscordMessageEvent(channel, \"My Epic Message\", allowGroupMentions);\n+Bukkit.getPluginManager().callEvent(event);\n+```\n+\n+#### Using your own message channel\n+If you want to create your own message type to allow your users to explicitly separate your\n+messages from our other built-in ones, you can do that also by creating a new\n+[`DiscordMessageEvent.MessageType`](https://github.com/EssentialsX/Essentials/blob/module/discord/EssentialsDiscord/src/main/java/net/essentialsx/api/v2/events/discord/DiscordMessageEvent.java#L159-L161).\n+The key provided in the constructor should be the key you'd like your users to use in the\n+`message-types` section of our config. You *can* also put a discord channel ID as the\n+key if you'd like to have your users define the channel id in your config rather than ours.\n+\n+Here is an example of what sending a message using your own message type:\n+```java\n+public class CustomTypeExample {\n+    // Create a new message type for the user to define in our config.\n+    // Unless you're putting a discord channel id as the type key, it's probably \n+    // a good idea to store this object so you don't create it every time.\n+    private final DiscordMessageEvent.MessageType type = new DiscordMessageEvent.MessageType(\"my-awesome-channel\");\n+    \n+    @EventHandler()\n+    public void onAwesomeEvent(AwesomeEvent event) {\n+      // Set to true if your message should be allowed to ping @everyone, @here, or roles.\n+      // If you are sending user-generated content, you probably should keep this as false.\n+      final boolean allowGroupMentions = false;\n+      // Construct and call the actual event\n+      final DiscordMessageEvent event = new DiscordMessageEvent(type, \"The player, \" + event.getPlayer() + \", did something awesome!\", allowPing);\n+      Bukkit.getPluginManager().callEvent(event);\n+    }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+### Prevent certain messages from being sent as chat\n+Depending on how your plugin sends certain types of chat messages to players, there may be\n+times when EssentialsxDiscord accidentally broadcasts a message that was only intended for a\n+small group of people. In order for your plugin to stop this from happening you have to\n+listen to `DiscordChatMessageEvent`.\n+\n+Here is an example of how a staff chat plugin would cancel a message:\n+```java\n+public class StaffChatExample {\n+    private final StaffChatPlugin plugin = ...;\n+    \n+    @EventHandler()\n+    public void onDiscordChatMessage(DiscordChatMessageEvent event) {\n+      // Checks if the player is in staff chat mode in this theoretical plugin.\n+      if (plugin.isPlayerInStaffChat(event.getPlayer()) || \n+              // or we could check if their message started with a # if we use that\n+              // to indicate typing in a specific channel.\n+              event.getMessage().startsWith(\"#\")) {\n+          event.setCanceled(true);\n+      }\n+    }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+### Registering a Discord slash command\n+EssentialsXDiscord also allows you to register slash commands directly with discord itself\n+in order to provide your users with a way to interface with your plugins on discord!\n+\n+To start writing slash commands, the first thing you'll need to do is create a slash command\n+class. For the sake of this tutorial, I'm going to use an economy plugin as the\n+hypothetical plugin creating this slash command.\n+\n+For this slash command, I'll create a simple command to a string (for player name) and\n+check their balance.\n+```java\n+public class BalanceSlashCommand extends InteractionCommand {\n+    private final MyEconomyPlugin plugin = ...;\n+    \n+    @Override\n+    public void onCommand(InteractionEvent event) {\n+        // The name of the argument here has to be the same you used in getArguments()\n+        final String playerName = event.getStringArgument(\"player\");\n+        final Player player = Bukkit.getPlayerExact(playerName);\n+        if (player == null) {\n+            event.reply(\"A player by that name could not be found!\");\n+            return;\n+        }\n+        \n+        final int balance = plugin.getBalance(player);\n+        \n+        // It is important you reply to the InteractionEvent at least once as discord\n+        // will show your bot is 'thinking' until you do so.\n+        event.reply(\"The balance of \" + player.getName() + \" is $\" + balance);\n+    }\n+    \n+    @Override\n+    public String getName() {\n+        // This should return the name of the command as you want it to appear in discord.\n+        // This method should never return different values.\n+        return \"balance\";\n+    }\n+\n+    @Override\n+    public String getDescription() {\n+        // This should return the description of the command as you want it \n+        // to appear in discord.\n+        // This method should never return different values.\n+        return \"Checks the balance of the given player\";\n+    }\n+    \n+    @Override\n+    public List<InteractionCommandArgument> getArguments() {\n+        // Should return a list of arguments that will be used in your command.\n+        // If you don't want any arguments, you can return null here.\n+        return List.of(\n+                new InteractionCommandArgument(\n+                        // This should be the name of the command argument.\n+                        // Keep it a single world, all lower case.\n+                        \"player\", \n+                        // This is the description of the argument.\n+                        \"The player to check the balance of\", \n+                        // This is the type of the argument you'd like to receive from\n+                        // discord.\n+                        InteractionCommandArgumentType.STRING,\n+                        // Should be set to true if the argument is required to send\n+                        // the command from discord.\n+                        true));\n+    }\n+    \n+    @Override\n+    public boolean isEphemeral() {\n+        // Whether or not the command and response should be hidden to other users on discord.\n+        // Return true here in order to hide command/responses from other discord users.\n+        return false;\n+    }\n+    \n+    @Override\n+    public boolean isDisabled() {\n+        // Whether or not the command should be prevented from being registered/executed.\n+        // Return true here in order to mark the command as disabled.\n+        return false;\n+    }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Once you have created your slash command, it's now time to register it.

Before starting your server, there are a few steps you have to take. First, you must create a new\n+discord bot at [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).\n+\n+1. Once on that page, click on \"New Application\" button on the top right, give your bot a name, and\n+then click \"Create\".\n+> ![Creating Application](https://i.imgur.com/8ffp4R1.gif)\n+> `New Application` -> Give Application a Name -> `Create`\n+\n+2. Once you create the application, you'll be directed to its overview. From this screen, you'll\n+need to copy your \"Client ID\" and save it for a later step. To copy your client id, click the\n+upper-left most blue \"Copy\" button. Make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Copy Client ID](https://i.imgur.com/W3OMTu5.gif)\n+> `Copy` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+3. Optionally, you can set an icon for your application as it will be the icon for the bot too.\n+> ![Avatar](https://i.imgur.com/NuFS9kT.png)\n+\n+4. The next step is actually creating a bot user for your application. From the overview screen,\n+this is done by going to the \"Bot\" tab on the left, then clicking the \"Add Bot\" on the right,\n+and finally then clicking \"Yes, do it!\".\n+> ![Create Bot](https://i.imgur.com/S14iAFS.gif)\n+> `Bot` -> `Add Bot` -> `Yes, do it!`\n+\n+5. Once on this screen, you'll need to uncheck the \"Public Bot\" setting and then click \"Save Changes\",\n+so other people can't add your bot to servers that are not your own.\n+> ![Disable Public Bot](https://i.imgur.com/HHqWvQ1.gif)\n+> Uncheck `Public Bot` -> `Save Changes`\n+\n+6. Finally, you'll need to copy your bot's token and save it for a later step. To copy your bot's token,\n+click the blue \"Copy\" button right of your bot's icon. Make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Copy Token](https://i.imgur.com/OqpaSQH.gif)\n+> `Copy` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+   \n+7. Next up is adding your bot to your discord server. First, goto [essentialsx.net/discord.html](https://essentialsx.net/discord.html)\n+and paste your Client ID you copied from step 2 into the text box on that page. Once you do that, click\n+the \"Authorize\" button next to the text box. This will redirect you to Discord's authorization website \n+to chose which server to add the bot to. Note for advanced users: Please use the `essentialsx.net` website above \n+even if you think you already know how to invite bots. Bots for EssentialsXDiscord require more than just the `bot`\n+scope to work, so please just use the link above even if you think you know what you're doing.\n+> ![OAuth Link Gen](https://i.imgur.com/u6MFJgQ.gif)\n+> Paste Client ID -> `Authorize`\n+\n+8. Once on the Discord authorization website, select the server from the \"Select a server\" dropdown \n+that you want to add the bot to. Then click the \"Authorize\" button. You may be prompted to confirm\n+you are not a bot, proceed with that like you would any other captcha.\n+> ![Authorize](https://i.imgur.com/KXkESqC.gif)\n+> Select Server -> `Authorize`\n+\n+9. For the next few steps, you're going to need to do some stuff in discord, so start up your\n+Discord desktop/web client. \n+\n+10. Once in your Discord client, you'll need to enable developer mode. Do this by going into the \n+Settings, then go to the \"Appearance\" tab and check on the \"Developer Mode\" at the bottom of the\n+page. Once you've checked \"Developer Mode\" on, click the `X` at the top right to exit Settings.\n+> ![Developer Mode](https://i.imgur.com/CrW31Up.gif)\n+> `User Settings` -> `Appearance` -> Check `Developer Mode` -> Exit Settings\n+\n+11. Next is copying a few IDs. First up, you'll want to copy the server (aka guild) id. Do this by\n+finding the server you added the bot to, right click its icon, and click \"Copy ID\". Once you copied\n+it, make sure to save it for a later step.\n+> ![Guild ID](https://i.imgur.com/0mg2yT3.gif)\n+> Right click server -> `Copy ID` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+12. The other ID you need to copy is the ID of the channel you wish to be your primary channel.\n+In other words, this will be the channel that, by default, receives messages for player chat/join/leave/death\n+messages as well as mute/kicks. To see how to further configure message types, see [Configuring Messages](#configuring-messages).\n+> ![Primary Channel ID](https://i.imgur.com/uMODfiQ.gif)\n+> Right click your 'primary' channel -> `Copy ID` -> Paste into Notepad for later step\n+\n+13. You've successfully copied all the necessary IDs needed for a basic setup. Next up is generating the\n+default config for EssentialsXDiscord, so you can start setting it up! Do this by putting the\n+EssentialsXDiscord jar (you can download it [here](https://essentialsx.net/downloads.html) if you do not\n+already have one) in your plugins folder, starting your server, and then stopping it as soon as it finishes\n+starting up.\n+> ![Start/Stop Server](https://i.imgur.com/JQX6hqM.gif)\n+> Drag EssentialsXDiscord jar into plugins folder -> Start Server -> Stop Server\n+\n+14. Now you can start to configure the plugin with all the stuff you copied from earlier. Open the config\n+for EssentialsXDiscord located at `plugins/EssentialsDiscord/config.yml`. When you open the config, the\n+first thing to configure is your bot's token. Replace `INSERT-TOKEN-HERE` in the config with the token you\n+copied earlier from step 6.\n+> ![Paste Token](https://i.imgur.com/EnD31Wg.gif)\n+> Re-Copy Token from Step 6 -> Paste as token value \n+\n+15. Next, is the guild id, replace the zeros for the guild value in the config with the guild id you copied\n+from step 13.\n+> ![Paste Guild](https://i.imgur.com/YxkHykd.gif)\n+\n+16. Finally, you'll need to paste the primary channel id you copied from step 14 and paste it as the\n+primary value in the channels section and once you've done that save the config file!\n+> ![Paste Primary](https://i.imgur.com/4xaHMfO.gif)\n+\n+17. Congratulations, you've completed the initial setup guide! When you start up your server, you should\n+notice that chat and other messages start showing up in the channel you requested they be. Now that you\n+completed the initial, go back up to the [Table Of Contents](#table-of-contents) to see what other cool things you can do!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Console Relay\n+The console relay is pretty self-explanatory: it relays everything on your console into discord channel of\n+your choosing. The console relay is ridiculously easy to setup and if your server is already running, you don't\n+need to reload it!\n+\n+0. This assumes you've already done the initial setup.\n+\n+1. Go to the discord server that your bot is in and find the channel you wish to use for console output.\n+Right click on the channel and click \"Copy ID\". Save this id for the next step.\n+> ![Copy ID](https://i.imgur.com/qvDfSLv.gif)\n+> Find console channel -> Right Click -> `Copy ID`\n+\n+2. Now that you have that copied, open the EssentialsXDiscord config and find the `console` section. In that\n+section, replace the zeros for the `channel` value with the channel id you copied from the last step. Once\n+you paste it, make sure you save the config.\n+> ![Paste ID](https://i.imgur.com/NicdpGw.gif)\n+\n+3. Finally, if your server is running, run `ess reload` from your console, otherwise start up your server. You\n+should notice console output being directed to that channel! That is all you need if you're okay with the default\n+settings. Otherwise, if you'd like to see what other options you can use to customize console output, stick around.\n+\n+4. The first thing you can customize is the format of the message sent to discord. By default, the timestamp,\n+level (info/warn/error/etc), and message are shown for each console message. Let's say you wanted to make the\n+timestamp and level bold, since this message would be using discord markdown, we can just add \\*\\* to both sides of\n+level and timestamp. Then once you've done that, just do `/ess reload` and you should see your changes on discord.\n+> ![Bold Format](https://i.imgur.com/jD9mH14.gif)\n+\n+5. Next, you can also configure the name you wish the to show above console messages. By default, it's \"EssX Console\n+Relay\" but can be switched to anything you want.\n+> ![Change Name](https://i.imgur.com/xtrt1Jt.gif)\n+\n+6. Finally, you can also choose to enable an option to treat any message by a user in the console channel as a\n+console command. This will mean that anyone who can send messages in your console channel **will be able to execute \n+commands as the console**. It is suggested that you stick to the regular `/execute` command \n+(see [Discord Commands](#discord-commands)) as those can be restricted to specific roles/users and are also not\n+restricted to the console channel.\n+> ![Command Relay](https://i.imgur.com/w3cfVUw.gif)\n+\n+7. That's all the options for the command relay!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Configuring Messages\n+EssentialsXDiscord aims to keep its message-type system basic enough that simple things take little changes, while\n+giving more fine grain control to those you want it.\n+\n+To give you a general overview of the system, EssentialsXDiscord allows you to define different channel IDs in the\n+`channels` section of the config. By default, two channels are pre-populated in the `channels` section, `primary`\n+and `staff`. If you only completed the initial setup, the `staff` channel definition is all zeros. This is fine in\n+most situations however, as the message system will always fallback to the `primary` channel if a channel ID is\n+invalid.\n+\n+Now on the to the types of messages you can receive themselves (which is where you're going to use these channel \n+definitions). In the `message-types` section of the config, you can see a list of message types (join/leave/chat/etc)\n+on the left (as the key), and on the right there is a channel definition.\n+\n+For the sake of example lets say we want to send all chat messages to their own channel. We can do this by creating\n+a new channel definition and setting the `chat` message type to said channel definition. Below are step-by-step \n+instructions for said example, you can follow along to get the gist of how to apply this to other use cases\n+\n+1. Find the channel on discord you want to only send chat messages to and then right click the channel and click\n+\"Copy ID\".\n+> ![Copy ID](https://i.imgur.com/ri7NZkD.gif)\n+\n+2. Next you need to create the actual channel definition, for this example we'll call it `chat`. You create a\n+channel definition by adding a new entry to the `channels` section with the key as its name and the id as the one\n+you copied in the last step.\n+> ![New Def](https://i.imgur.com/dc7kIkl.gif)\n+\n+3. Finally, scroll down to the `message-types` section and change the `chat` message type to your newly created\n+channel definition. Once you do that, save and either run `/ess reload` if your server is running or start your\n+server.\n+> ![Move](https://i.imgur.com/qPVWkWF.gif)\n+\n+4. That's all you need to know about the basics of the message system!\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Receive Discord Messages in Minecraft\n+After reading the [configuring messages section](#configuring-messages), you should now have a few discord\n+channels defined in the `channels` of your config. You're probably wondering how you can let your players start\n+to see messages from discord in minecraft chat. Say I defined a channel named `chat` in the `channels` section\n+of your config, and I wanted to let players see discord messages from that channel in minecraft chat; This can\n+be accomplished very simply by giving players the `essentials.discord.receive.chat` permission. This would relay\n+all discord messages from the `chat` channel to players with that permission. Another example: say I have a staff\n+channel in discord that I want only staff members in the minecraft server to see. Provided there is a `staff`\n+channel defined in the `channels` section of the config, I can give staff members the\n+`essentials.discord.receive.staff` permission, and they will start to see messages from that channel.\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Discord Commands\n+EssentialsXDiscord uses Discord's slash command system to let you type commands into discord without it being\n+seen by other people in the server. With this system, you are able to execute console commands, message players,\n+and see the current player list.\n+\n+For example, here's what the `/execute` command looks like by default:\n+> ![/execute](https://i.imgur.com/yPN22bV.gif)\n+\n+As you can see, you can seamlessly run commands without people seeing the content of your commands or their\n+response. Additionally, you can also delete the responses once you're done looking at them, so they don't clutter\n+your chat.\n+\n+However, this is all configurable! In the `commands` section of the config, lies a ton of options to configure\n+settings on a per-command basis. Below are explanations of what all the configuration options mean and how to use\n+them.\n+\n+* `enabled`\n+  * Default: `true`\n+  * Description: `Whether or not the command should be enabled and therefore shown on discord. Note that you\n+    must restart your minecraft server before this option takes effect.`\n+* `hide-command`\n+  * Default: `true`\n+  * Description: `Whether other people should not be able to see what commands you execute. Setting to false\n+    would allow people in the same channel as you to see exactly what command you execute. In the example below,\n+    you can see how disabling this option shows a message of the user and the command they executed.`\n+  * Example: ![Show Command](https://i.imgur.com/Q61iP4n.gif)\n+* `allowed-roles`\n+  * Description: `A list of user ids or role names/ids that are allowed to use the command. You can also use '*'\n+    in order to allow everyone to use the command.`\n+* `admin-roles`\n+  * `A list of user ids or role names/ids that have extra features in the command. For example, in the list\n+    command, admin-roles allows people to see vanished players.`\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Misc Permissions\n+EssentialsXDiscord has a few miscellanies permissions that may be important to know about;\n+\n+* `essentials.discord.markdown` - Allows players to bypass the markdown filter, so that they can \n+bold/underline/italic/etc their minecraft chat messages for discord.\n+* `essentials.discord.ping` - Allows players to bypass the ping filter, so that they can ping @everyone/@here\n+from minecraft chat.\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Developer API\n+EssentialsXDiscord has a pretty extensive API which allows any third party plugin to build\n+their own integrations into it. Outside the specific examples below, you can also view\n+javadocs for EssentialsXDiscord [here](https://jd-v2.essentialsx.net/EssentialsDiscord).\n+\n+### Sending Messages to Discord\n+EssentialsXDiscord organizes the types of messages that can be sent along with their \n+destination on discord under the `message-types` section of the `config.yml`. The \n+EssentialsXDiscord API uses `message-types` to resolve the channel id you want to send your\n+message to.\n+\n+#### Using a built-in message channel\n+EssentialsXDiscord defines a few built in `message-types` which you may fit your use case\n+already (such as sending a message to the mc->discord chat relay channel). The list of \n+built-in message types can be found at [`DiscordMessageEvent.MessageType.DefaultTypes`](https://github.com/EssentialsX/Essentials/blob/2.x/EssentialsDiscord/src/main/java/net/essentialsx/api/v2/events/discord/DiscordMessageEvent.java#L195-L203).\n+\n+Here is an example of what sending a message to the built-in chat channel would look like:\n+```java\n+// The built in channel you want to send your message to, in this case the chat channel.\n+final MessageType channel = DiscordMessageEvent.MessageType.DefaultTypes.CHAT;\n+// Set to true if your message should be allowed to ping @everyone, @here, or roles.\n+// If you are sending user-generated content, you probably should keep this as false.\n+final boolean allowGroupMentions = false;\n+// Construct and call the actual event\n+final DiscordMessageEvent event = new DiscordMessageEvent(channel, \"My Epic Message\", allowGroupMentions);\n+Bukkit.getPluginManager().callEvent(event);\n+```\n+\n+#### Using your own message channel\n+If you want to create your own message type to allow your users to explicitly separate your\n+messages from our other built-in ones, you can do that also by creating a new\n+[`DiscordMessageEvent.MessageType`](https://github.com/EssentialsX/Essentials/blob/module/discord/EssentialsDiscord/src/main/java/net/essentialsx/api/v2/events/discord/DiscordMessageEvent.java#L159-L161).\n+The key provided in the constructor should be the key you'd like your users to use in the\n+`message-types` section of our config. You *can* also put a discord channel ID as the\n+key if you'd like to have your users define the channel id in your config rather than ours.\n+\n+Here is an example of what sending a message using your own message type:\n+```java\n+public class CustomTypeExample {\n+    // Create a new message type for the user to define in our config.\n+    // Unless you're putting a discord channel id as the type key, it's probably \n+    // a good idea to store this object so you don't create it every time.\n+    private final DiscordMessageEvent.MessageType type = new DiscordMessageEvent.MessageType(\"my-awesome-channel\");\n+    \n+    @EventHandler()\n+    public void onAwesomeEvent(AwesomeEvent event) {\n+      // Set to true if your message should be allowed to ping @everyone, @here, or roles.\n+      // If you are sending user-generated content, you probably should keep this as false.\n+      final boolean allowGroupMentions = false;\n+      // Construct and call the actual event\n+      final DiscordMessageEvent event = new DiscordMessageEvent(type, \"The player, \" + event.getPlayer() + \", did something awesome!\", allowPing);\n+      Bukkit.getPluginManager().callEvent(event);\n+    }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+### Prevent certain messages from being sent as chat\n+Depending on how your plugin sends certain types of chat messages to players, there may be\n+times when EssentialsxDiscord accidentally broadcasts a message that was only intended for a\n+small group of people. In order for your plugin to stop this from happening you have to\n+listen to `DiscordChatMessageEvent`.\n+\n+Here is an example of how a staff chat plugin would cancel a message:\n+```java\n+public class StaffChatExample {\n+    private final StaffChatPlugin plugin = ...;\n+    \n+    @EventHandler()\n+    public void onDiscordChatMessage(DiscordChatMessageEvent event) {\n+      // Checks if the player is in staff chat mode in this theoretical plugin.\n+      if (plugin.isPlayerInStaffChat(event.getPlayer()) || \n+              // or we could check if their message started with a # if we use that\n+              // to indicate typing in a specific channel.\n+              event.getMessage().startsWith(\"#\")) {\n+          event.setCanceled(true);\n+      }\n+    }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+### Registering a Discord slash command\n+EssentialsXDiscord also allows you to register slash commands directly with discord itself\n+in order to provide your users with a way to interface with your plugins on discord!\n+\n+To start writing slash commands, the first thing you'll need to do is create a slash command\n+class. For the sake of this tutorial, I'm going to use an economy plugin as the\n+hypothetical plugin creating this slash command.\n+\n+For this slash command, I'll create a simple command to a string (for player name) and\n+check their balance.\n+```java\n+public class BalanceSlashCommand extends InteractionCommand {\n+    private final MyEconomyPlugin plugin = ...;\n+    \n+    @Override\n+    public void onCommand(InteractionEvent event) {\n+        // The name of the argument here has to be the same you used in getArguments()\n+        final String playerName = event.getStringArgument(\"player\");\n+        final Player player = Bukkit.getPlayerExact(playerName);\n+        if (player == null) {\n+            event.reply(\"A player by that name could not be found!\");\n+            return;\n+        }\n+        \n+        final int balance = plugin.getBalance(player);\n+        \n+        // It is important you reply to the InteractionEvent at least once as discord\n+        // will show your bot is 'thinking' until you do so.\n+        event.reply(\"The balance of \" + player.getName() + \" is $\" + balance);\n+    }\n+    \n+    @Override\n+    public String getName() {\n+        // This should return the name of the command as you want it to appear in discord.\n+        // This method should never return different values.\n+        return \"balance\";\n+    }\n+\n+    @Override\n+    public String getDescription() {\n+        // This should return the description of the command as you want it \n+        // to appear in discord.\n+        // This method should never return different values.\n+        return \"Checks the balance of the given player\";\n+    }\n+    \n+    @Override\n+    public List<InteractionCommandArgument> getArguments() {\n+        // Should return a list of arguments that will be used in your command.\n+        // If you don't want any arguments, you can return null here.\n+        return List.of(\n+                new InteractionCommandArgument(\n+                        // This should be the name of the command argument.\n+                        // Keep it a single world, all lower case.\n+                        \"player\", \n+                        // This is the description of the argument.\n+                        \"The player to check the balance of\", \n+                        // This is the type of the argument you'd like to receive from\n+                        // discord.\n+                        InteractionCommandArgumentType.STRING,\n+                        // Should be set to true if the argument is required to send\n+                        // the command from discord.\n+                        true));\n+    }\n+    \n+    @Override\n+    public boolean isEphemeral() {\n+        // Whether or not the command and response should be hidden to other users on discord.\n+        // Return true here in order to hide command/responses from other discord users.\n+        return false;\n+    }\n+    \n+    @Override\n+    public boolean isDisabled() {\n+        // Whether or not the command should be prevented from being registered/executed.\n+        // Return true here in order to mark the command as disabled.\n+        return false;\n+    }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Once you have created your slash command, it's now time to register it. It is best \n+practice to register them in your plugin's `onEnable` so your commands make it in the\n+initial batch of commands sent to discord.\n+\n+You can register your command with EssentialsXDiscord by doing the following:", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "99a4b3ab018d821d7dc3e6713b3099f05db6ff73"}, "originalPosition": 431}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkNDE4NjcyNTIxOnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "EssentialsDiscord/src/main/java/net/essentialsx/api/v2/services/discord/InteractionEvent.java", "isResolved": true, "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMS0wNi0yNlQyMjo0NzoyMVrOJ0seLg==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMS0wNi0yNlQyMjo0NzoyMVrOJ0seLg==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDY1OTIzNDM1MA==", "bodyText": "This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

For the victim, the deceptive person, known henceforth as the \"troll\", has done something evil, so vile that it makes the victim yell and/or scream in a fit of rage and then repeatedly smash their face and hands against their computer, possibly breaking hundreds of expensive components.
