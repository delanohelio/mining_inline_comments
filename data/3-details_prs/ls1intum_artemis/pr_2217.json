Add exercises with different variants, register students, generate student exams. For more information see `Create and Configure Exam`_.\n+\n+    .. _exam_conduction:\n+\n+- **Exam Conduction**\n+    The exam conduction starts when the exam becomes visible to the students and ends when the latest working time is over. When the exam conduction begins, you cannot make any changes anymore to the exam configuration or individual student exams. \n+\n+    .. _exam_assessment:\n+\n+- **Exam Assessment**\n+    The assessment begins as soon as the latest student exam working time is over. During this period, your team can assess the submissions of the students and provide results. The testing suites for programming exercises are executed and you can evaluate the quiz exercises automatically, see `Assess Student Exams and Complaints`_. The exam assessment ends when the results are published, see `Create and Configure Exam`_.\n+\n+    .. _student_review:\n+\n+- **Student Review**\n+    The student review period can be set in the exam configuration, see `Create and Configure Exam`_. During the review period, students have the oppertunity to submit complaints about perceived mistakes made in the assessment. A second assessor, other than the original one can review the complaint and respond to it. The results are then updated automatically. \n+\n+\n+Accessing the Exam Management Page\n+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n+- Log in to Artemis with your account credentials.\n+- Head to ``Course Management``.\n+- Click on ``Exams`` for your course. It will open the *Exam Management Screen*.\n+\n+    - Here you have access to all the exams of your course. All aspects of the exam are managed from the management screen. \n+\n+- You can create an exam by clicking on ``Create new Exam``. \n+\n+Create and Configure Exam\n+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n+- When you click on ``create an exam`` you are presented with the *Create Exam* view. Here you can set the basic information such as ``title``, ``examiner`` etc. The :ref:`timeline of the exam <timeline>` is defined by the dates: ``visible from``, ``start of working time``, ``end of working time``, ``release date of results``, ``begin of student review``, ``end of student review``. \n+- The first three dates are mandatory when you create an exam. The rest can be set when required. \n+- The ``grace period`` defines the amount of time the students have at their disposal to hand in their exam after the ``working time`` is over. This is set to 3 minutes by default. \n+- You can also define the ``number of exercises`` in the exam. You can leave this out initally, however it must be set before you can generate the student exams. For more information, see `Exercise Groups`_. \n+- If you activate ``randomize order of exercise groups``, the order of the exercises will be random for each student. \n+- Finally, you can fill out the ``exam start-`` and ``end texts``. These will be displayed during the :ref:`exam conduction <exam_conduction>` to the students, at the *Start-* and *End* page respectively.\n+\n+.. figure:: instructor/exam_configuration.png\n+   :alt: Create and Configure\n+   :align: center\n+\n+   Create and Configure the Exam\n+\n+Exercise Groups\n+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n+- Artemis exam mode allows you to define multiple exercise variants so that each student can receive a unique exam. This is done through the exercise groups. Exercise groups represent an individual exercise slot for each student exam. Within one exercise group you can define different exercises. \n+- Artemis selects one exercise per exercise group randomly to generate the individual student exams. \n+- You can distinguish between ``mandatory`` exercise groups and ``non-mandatory`` exercise groups. By default, every exercise group is mandatory. You can set the ``mandetory`` flag when you add a exercise group initially, or later by clicking ``edit`` on the exercise group.\n+\n+.. figure:: instructor/exercise_variants.png\n+   :alt: Exercise Groups with different Exercise Variants\n+   :align: center\n+\n+   Exercise Groups with different Exercise Variants\n+\n+Add Exercises\n+^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n+- Exercises are grouped by exercise groups. For every student exam, one exercise per exercise group will be chosen, see `Exercise Groups`_. \n+\n+     - **Hint:** If you want all student to have the same exam, define only one exercise per exercise group.\n+\n+- To add exercises navigate to the *Exercise Groups* of the exam. On the header of each exercise group you will find the available exercise types. You can choose between ``creating a new exercise`` or ``importing an existing one`` from your courses. \n+\n+    - **Hint:** For programming exercises you can check the option to ``allow manual assessment``. If you do not set this flag, your assessors will not be able to manually assess the student's submissions during the :ref:`assessment process <exam_assessment>`.\n+\n+- For exercise types ``text``, ``programming``, and ``modeling``, you can also define example submissions and example assessments to guide your assessor team.\n+\n+.. figure:: instructor/add_exercises.png\n+   :alt: Add different Exercises\n+   :align: center\n+\n+   Add different Exercises\n+\n+Registering Students\n+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n+- To register students to the exam, navigate from the exam management to the *Students* page. Here you are presented with two options to register students. You can: \n+\n+    1. Add students manually my searching via the search bar\n+    2. Bulk import students using a ``.csv`` file. You can do this by pressing the ``Import students`` button.\n+\n+- You can also remove students from the exam. When you do so, you have the option to also delete their participations and submissions linked to the user\u2019s student exam. \n+    \n+    - **Hint:** Just registering the students to the exam will not allow them to participate in the exam. First, individual student exams must be generated. For more information see `Manage Student Exams`_.\n+\n+.. figure:: instructor/add_students.png\n+   :alt: Register Students\n+   :align: center\n+\n+   Register Students Page\n+\n+Manage Student Exams\n+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n+-  The student exams are managed via the *Student Exams* page. \n+- Here you can have an overview of all student exams. When you press ``View`` on a student exam, you can view the ``details of the student``, the allocated ``working time``, his/her ``participation status``, their ``summary`` as well as their ``scores``. Additionally, you will also be able to view which assessor is responsible for each exercise. \n+\n+    - **Hint:** You can change the individual ``working time`` of students from here. \n+\n+- To generate the student exams, you must click on ``Generate individual exams``. This will automatically create a student exam for every registered user. The number of exercises will be determined by the flag set in the exam configuration, see `Create and Configure Exam`_. The exercises itself will be randomly selected from the available exercise variants per exercise group, see `Exercise Groups`_.\n+- The ``Generate individual exams`` button will be locked once the exam becomes visible to the students. You cannot perform changes to the student exams once the :ref:`exam conduction <exam_conduction>` has started. \n+- If you have added more students recently, you can choose to ``Generate missing individual exams``. \n+- ``Prepare exercise start`` creates a participation for each exercise for every registered user, based on their assigned exercises. It also creates the individual repositories and build plans for programming exercises. This action can take a while if there are many registered students due to the communication between the VC and CI server.

It will open the *Exam Management Screen*.\n+\n+- Here you have access to all the exams of your course. All aspects of the exam are managed from the management screen. \n+\n+- You can create an exam by clicking on |create_new_exam|. \n+\n+1.2 Create and Configure Exam\n+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n+- When you click on |create_new_exam| you are presented with the *Create Exam* view. Here you can set the basic information such as ``title``, ``examiner`` etc. The :ref:`timeline of the exam <timeline>` is defined by the dates: ``visible from``, ``start of working time``, ``end of working time``, ``release date of results``, ``begin of student review``, ``end of student review``. \n+- The first three dates are mandatory when you create an exam. The rest can be set when required. \n+- The ``grace period`` defines the amount of time the students have at their disposal to hand in their exam after the ``working time`` is over. This is set to 3 minutes by default. \n+- You can also define the ``number of exercises`` in the exam. You can leave this out initally, however it must be set before you can generate the :ref:`student exams <student_exams>`. For more information, see `1.3 Exercise Groups`_. \n+- Artemis will randomize the order of the exercises for each student if you you activate ``randomize order of exercise groups``.\n+- Finally, you can fill out the exam ``start text`` and ``end text``.

Artemis achieves this through exercise groups. Exercise groups represent an individual exercise slot for each :ref:`student exam <student_exams>`. Within one exercise group you can define different exercises. \n+- Artemis selects one exercise per exercise group randomly, to generate the individual :ref:`student exams <student_exams>`. \n+- You can distinguish between ``mandatory`` exercise groups and ``non-mandatory`` exercise groups. \n+- Artemis always includes ``mandatory`` exercise groups in the individual exam of a student. \n+- ``non-mandatory`` exercise groups can be left out, if there are more exercise groups than the ``number of exercises`` defined in the :ref:`exam configuration <exam_creation_and_configuration>`.\n+- By default, every exercise group is mandatory. You can set the ``mandetory`` flag when you add a exercise group initially, or later by clicking |edit| on the exercise group.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "dcfe4576a90c2cdeff73be2913e7322763b9705a"}, "originalPosition": 60}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwODM4MTg5Mg==", "bodyText": "Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n            - At the end of the online exercise, you must be online within a given ``grace period`` and submit your exam, otherwise it will not be graded\n          \n          \n            \n            - At the end of the online exercise, you must be online within a given ``grace period`` and submit your exam, otherwise it will not be graded.", "url": "https://github.com/ls1intum/Artemis/pull/2217#discussion_r508381892", "createdAt": "2020-10-20T10:18:19Z", "author": {"login": "FuchsDominik"}, "path": "docs/user/exams/students_guide.rst", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,340 @@\n+===================\n+Students\u2019 Guide\n+===================\n+\n+General Information\n+-------------------\n+\n+Prerequisites\n+^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n+- **Stable internet connection**\n+\n+    **Recommendation:** Use a LAN connection if possible.\n+\n+- **Browser**\n+    \n+    **Recommendation:** Chromium (based), e.g. Google Chrome, newest version.\n+\n+- The following prerequisites are only required if your exam contains programming exercises: \n+\n+    - **Java IDE with JDK 15**\n+        \n+        **Recommendation:** Eclipse IDE 2020\u201109.\n+    \n+    - **Git Client**\n+        \n+        **Recommendation:** SourceTree\n+\n+\n+Offline Mode\n+^^^^^^^^^^^^\n+- The exam mode in Artemis tolerates issues with the Internet connection.\n+- In case you are not connected, you can continue working on text-, quiz- and modeling exercises, but you might get warnings that your solutions cannot be saved.\n+- If your Internet connection recovers, Artemis will save your solution.\n+- Artemis tries to save your solution every 30 seconds, when you navigate between exercises and when you click |save| or |save_continue|.\n+- Programming exercises have 2 modes.\n+\n+    1. **Online code editor:** can only be used when you are online. \n+\n+        .. note::\n+            You have to click on Submit!

The rest can be set when required. \n+- The ``grace period`` defines the amount of time the students have at their disposal to hand in their exam after the ``working time`` is over. This is set to 3 minutes by default. \n+- You can also define the ``number of exercises`` in the exam. You can leave this out initally, however it must be set before you can generate the :ref:`student exams <student_exams>`.
