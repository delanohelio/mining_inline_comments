Retrieving and Building Objects\n+==================================\n+\n+The cost of retrieving and building an object's relationships far exceeds the cost of selecting the object. This is especially true for relationships where it would trigger the loading of every child through the relationship hierarchy. The solution to this issue is **lazy fetching** (lazy loading). Lazy fetching allows the fetching of a relationship to be deferred until it is accessed. This is important not only to avoid the database access, but also to avoid the cost of building the objects if they are not needed. |br|\n+\n+In JPA lazy fetching can be set on any relationship using the fetch attribute. The fetch can be set to either ``LAZY`` or ``EAGER`` as defined in the ``FetchType`` enum. The default fetch type is ``LAZY`` for all relationships except for **OneToOne** and **ManyToOne**, but in general it is a good idea to make every relationship ``LAZY``. The ``EAGER`` default for **OneToOne** and **ManyToOne** is for implementation reasons (more difficult to implement), not because it is a good idea. |br|\n+\n+We **always** use ``FetchType.LAZY``, unless there is a very strong case to be made for ``FetchType.EAGER``.\n+\n+       .. note::\n+        Additional effort to use ``FetchType.LAZY`` does count as a strong argument.\n+\n+2. Relationships\n+================\n+\n+A relationship is a reference from one object to another. In a relational database relationships are defined through foreign keys. The source row contains the primary key of the target row to define the relationship (and sometimes the inverse). A query must be performed to read the target objects of the relationship using the foreign key and primary key information. In Java, if a relationship is to a collection of other objects, a ``Collection`` or ``array`` type is used in Java to hold the contents of the relationship. In a relational database, collection relations are either defined by the target objects having a foreign key back to the source object's primary key, or by having an intermediate join table to store the relationship (both objects' primary keys). |br|\n+\n+In this section, we depict common entity relationships we use in Artemis and show some code snippets. \n+\n+* **OneToOne** A unique reference from one object to another. It is also inverse of itself. Example: one ``Complaint`` has a reference to one ``Result``.\n+\n+ .. code:: java\n+\n+    // Complaint.java\n+    @OneToOne\n+    @JoinColumn(unique = true)\n+    private Result result;\n+\n+* **OneToMany** A ``Collection`` or ``Map`` of objects. It is the inverse of a **ManyToOne** relationship. Example: one ``Result`` has a list of ``Feedback`` elements. For ordered OneToMany relations see :ref:`ordered collections <ordered>`.\n+\n+ .. code:: java\n+\n+    // Result.java\n+    @OneToMany(mappedBy = \"result\", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)\n+    @OrderColumn\n+    @JsonIgnoreProperties(value = \"result\", allowSetters = true)\n+    @Cache(usage = CacheConcurrencyStrategy.NONSTRICT_READ_WRITE)\n+    @JsonView(QuizView.Before.class)\n+    private List<Feedback> feedbacks = new ArrayList<>();\n+\n+\n+* **ManyToOne** A reference from one object to another. It is the inverse of a **OneToMany** relationship. Example: one ``Feedback`` has a reference to one ``Result``. \n+\n+ .. code:: java\n+\n+    // Feedback.java\n+    @ManyToOne\n+    @JsonIgnoreProperties(\"feedbacks\")\n+    private Result result;\n+\n+\n+* **ManyToMany** ``A Collection`` or ``Map`` of objects. It is the inverse of a itself. Example: one ``Exercise`` has a list of ``LearningGoal`` elements, one ``LearningGoal`` has list of ``Exercise`` elements. In other words: many exercises are connected to many learning goals and vice-versa.\n+\n+ .. code:: java\n+\n+    // Exercise.java\n+    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = \"exercises\")\n+    public Set<LearningGoal> learningGoals = new HashSet<>();\n+\n+    // LearningGoal.java\n+    @ManyToMany\n+    @JoinTable(name = \"learning_goal_exercise\", joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = \"learning_goal_id\", referencedColumnName = \"id\"), inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = \"exercise_id\", referencedColumnName = \"id\"))\n+    @JsonIgnoreProperties(\"learningGoals\")\n+    private Set<Exercise> exercises = new HashSet<>();\n+\n+\n+ .. warning::\n+        For **OneToMany**, **ManyToOne**, and **ManyToMany** relationships you must not forget to mark the associated elements with ``@JsonIgnoreProperties()``. Without this, the object serialization process with be stuck in an endless loop and throw an error. For more information check out the examples listed above and see: `Jackson and JsonIgnoreType <https://www.concretepage.com/jackson-api/jackson-jsonignore-jsonignoreproperties-and-jsonignoretype>`_. \n+\n+\n+2. Cascade Types\n+=================\n+Entity relationships often depend on the existence of another entity \u2014 for example, the Result-Feedback relationship. Without the Result, the Feedback entity doesn't have any meaning of its own. When we delete the Result entity, our Feedback entity should also get deleted. For more information see: `jpa cascade types <https://www.baeldung.com/jpa-cascade-types>`_.\n+\n+* ``CascadeType.ALL`` Propagates all operations mentioned below from the parent object to the to child object. \n+\n+ .. code-block:: java\n+\n+    // Result.java\n+    @OneToMany(mappedBy = \"result\", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)\n+    @OrderColumn\n+    @JsonIgnoreProperties(value = \"result\", allowSetters = true)\n+    @Cache(usage = CacheConcurrencyStrategy.NONSTRICT_READ_WRITE)\n+    @JsonView(QuizView.Before.class)\n+    private List<Feedback> feedbacks = new ArrayList<>();\n+\n+\n+* ``CascadeType.PERSIST`` When persisting a parent entity, it also persists the child entities held in its fields. This cascade rule is helpful for relationships where the parent acts as a *container* to the child entity. If you do not use this, you have to ensure that you persist the child entity first, otherwise an error will be thrown. Example: The code below propagates the **persist** operation from parent ``AnswerCounter`` to child ``AnswerOption``. When an ``AnswerCounter`` is persisted, its ``AnswerOption`` is persisted as well.\u00a0\n+\n+ .. code-block:: java\n+\n+    // AnswerCounter.java\n+    @OneToOne(cascade = { CascadeType.PERSIST })\n+    @JoinColumn(unique = true)\n+    private AnswerOption answer;\n+\n+\n+* ``CascadeType.MERGE`` If you merge the source entity (saved/updated/synchronized)  to the database, the merge is cascaded to the target of the association. This rule applies to existing objects only. Use this type to always merge/synchronize the existing data in the table with the data in the object. Example below: whenever we merge a ``Result`` to the database, i.e. save the changes on the object, the ``Assessor`` object is also merged/saved.\u00a0\n+\n+ .. code-block:: java\n+\n+    // Result.java\n+    @OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.MERGE, fetch = FetchType.LAZY)\n+    @JoinColumn(unique = false)\n+    private User assessor;\n+\n+\n+* ``CascadeType.REMOVE`` If the source entity is removed, the target of the association is also removed. Example below: propagates **remove** operation from parent ``Submission`` to child ``Result``. When a ``Submission`` is deleted, also the ``Result`` is deleted.\n+\n+ .. code-block:: java\n+\n+    // Submission.java\n+    @OneToOne(mappedBy = \"submission\", fetch = FetchType.LAZY, cascade = CascadeType.REMOVE)\n+    @JsonIgnoreProperties({ \"submission\", \"participation\" })\n+    @JoinColumn(unique = true)\n+    private Result result;\n+ \n+\n+* ``CascadeType.REFRESH`` If the source entity is refreshed, it cascades the refresh to the target of the association. This is used to refresh the data in the object and its associations. This is useful for cases where there is a change which needs to be synchronized FROM the database.\n+\n+Not used in Artemis yet\n+\n+\n+Best Practices\n+===============\n+* If you want to create a ``@OneToMany`` relationship or ``@ManyToMany`` relationship, first think about if it is important for the association to be ordered.

Without this, the object serialization process with be stuck in an endless loop and throw an error. For more information check out the examples listed above and see: `Jackson and JsonIgnoreType <https://www.concretepage.com/jackson-api/jackson-jsonignore-jsonignoreproperties-and-jsonignoretype>`_. \n+\n+\n+2. Cascade Types\n+=================\n+Entity relationships often depend on the existence of another entity \u2014 for example, the Result-Feedback relationship. Without the Result, the Feedback entity doesn't have any meaning of its own. When we delete the Result entity, our Feedback entity should also get deleted. For more information see: `jpa cascade types <https://www.baeldung.com/jpa-cascade-types>`_.\n+\n+* ``CascadeType.ALL`` Propagates all operations mentioned below from the parent object to the to child object. \n+\n+ .. code-block:: java\n+\n+    // Result.java\n+    @OneToMany(mappedBy = \"result\", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)\n+    @OrderColumn\n+    @JsonIgnoreProperties(value = \"result\", allowSetters = true)\n+    @Cache(usage = CacheConcurrencyStrategy.NONSTRICT_READ_WRITE)\n+    @JsonView(QuizView.Before.class)\n+    private List<Feedback> feedbacks = new ArrayList<>();\n+\n+\n+* ``CascadeType.PERSIST`` When persisting a parent entity, it also persists the child entities held in its fields. This cascade rule is helpful for relationships where the parent acts as a *container* to the child entity. If you do not use this, you have to ensure that you persist the child entity first, otherwise an error will be thrown. Example: The code below propagates the **persist** operation from parent ``AnswerCounter`` to child ``AnswerOption``. When an ``AnswerCounter`` is persisted, its ``AnswerOption`` is persisted as well.\u00a0\n+\n+ .. code-block:: java\n+\n+    // AnswerCounter.java\n+    @OneToOne(cascade = { CascadeType.PERSIST })\n+    @JoinColumn(unique = true)\n+    private AnswerOption answer;\n+\n+\n+* ``CascadeType.MERGE`` If you merge the source entity (saved/updated/synchronized)  to the database, the merge is cascaded to the target of the association. This rule applies to existing objects only. Use this type to always merge/synchronize the existing data in the table with the data in the object. Example below: whenever we merge a ``Result`` to the database, i.e. save the changes on the object, the ``Assessor`` object is also merged/saved.\u00a0\n+\n+ .. code-block:: java\n+\n+    // Result.java\n+    @OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.MERGE, fetch = FetchType.LAZY)\n+    @JoinColumn(unique = false)\n+    private User assessor;\n+\n+\n+* ``CascadeType.REMOVE`` If the source entity is removed, the target of the association is also removed. Example below: propagates **remove** operation from parent ``Submission`` to child ``Result``. When a ``Submission`` is deleted, also the ``Result`` is deleted.\n+\n+ .. code-block:: java\n+\n+    // Submission.java\n+    @OneToOne(mappedBy = \"submission\", fetch = FetchType.LAZY, cascade = CascadeType.REMOVE)\n+    @JsonIgnoreProperties({ \"submission\", \"participation\" })\n+    @JoinColumn(unique = true)\n+    private Result result;\n+ \n+\n+* ``CascadeType.REFRESH`` If the source entity is refreshed, it cascades the refresh to the target of the association. This is used to refresh the data in the object and its associations. This is useful for cases where there is a change which needs to be synchronized FROM the database.\n+\n+Not used in Artemis yet\n+\n+\n+Best Practices\n+===============\n+* If you want to create a ``@OneToMany`` relationship or ``@ManyToMany`` relationship, first think about if it is important for the association to be ordered. If you do not need to association to be ordered, then always go for a ``Set`` instead of ``List``. If you are unsure, start with a ``Set``.\u00a0\n+\n+  * **Unordered Collection**: A ``Set`` comes with certain advantages such as ensuring that there are no duplicates and null values in your collection. There are also performance arguments to be made to use a ``Set``, especially for ``@ManyToMany`` relationships.

Relationships\n+================\n+\n+A relationship is a reference from one object to another. In a relational database relationships are defined through foreign keys. The source row contains the primary key of the target row to define the relationship (and sometimes the inverse). A query must be performed to read the target objects of the relationship using the foreign key and primary key information. In Java, if a relationship is to a collection of other objects, a ``Collection`` or ``array`` type is used in Java to hold the contents of the relationship. In a relational database, collection relations are either defined by the target objects having a foreign key back to the source object's primary key, or by having an intermediate join table to store the relationship (both objects' primary keys). |br|\n+\n+In this section, we depict common entity relationships we use in Artemis and show some code snippets. \n+\n+* **OneToOne** A unique reference from one object to another. It is also inverse of itself.

It is the inverse of a **OneToMany** relationship. Example: one ``Feedback`` has a reference to one ``Result``. \n+\n+ .. code:: java\n+\n+    // Feedback.java\n+    @ManyToOne\n+    @JsonIgnoreProperties(\"feedbacks\")\n+    private Result result;\n+\n+\n+* **ManyToMany** ``A Collection`` or ``Map`` of objects. It is the inverse of a itself. Example: one ``Exercise`` has a list of ``LearningGoal`` elements, one ``LearningGoal`` has list of ``Exercise`` elements. In other words: many exercises are connected to many learning goals and vice-versa.\n+\n+ .. code:: java\n+\n+    // Exercise.java\n+    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = \"exercises\")\n+    public Set<LearningGoal> learningGoals = new HashSet<>();\n+\n+    // LearningGoal.java\n+    @ManyToMany\n+    @JoinTable(name = \"learning_goal_exercise\", joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = \"learning_goal_id\", referencedColumnName = \"id\"), inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = \"exercise_id\", referencedColumnName = \"id\"))\n+    @JsonIgnoreProperties(\"learningGoals\")\n+    private Set<Exercise> exercises = new HashSet<>();\n+\n+\n+ .. warning::\n+        For **OneToMany**, **ManyToOne**, and **ManyToMany** relationships you must not forget to mark the associated elements with ``@JsonIgnoreProperties()``.

This cascade rule is helpful for relationships where the parent acts as a *container* to the child entity. If you do not use this, you have to ensure that you persist the child entity first, otherwise an error will be thrown.

If you do not need the association to be ordered, then always go for a ``Set`` instead of ``List``. If you are unsure, start with a ``Set``.\u00a0\n+\n+  * **Unordered Collection**: A ``Set`` comes with certain advantages such as ensuring that there are no duplicates and null values in your collection. There are also performance arguments to use a ``Set``, especially for ``@ManyToMany`` relationships. For more information see this `stackoverflow thread <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4655392/which-java-type-do-you-use-for-jpa-collections-and-why>`_. E.g.:\n+\n+       .. code-block:: java\n+\n+        // Course.java\n+        @OneToMany(mappedBy = \"course\", fetch = FetchType.LAZY)\n+        @Cache(usage = CacheConcurrencyStrategy.NONSTRICT_READ_WRITE)\n+        @JsonIgnoreProperties(\"course\")\n+        private Set<Exercise> exercises = new HashSet<>();\n+\n+\n+.. _ordered:\n+\n+  * **Ordered Collection**: When you want to order the collection of objects of the relationship, then always use a ``List``. It is important to note here that there is no inherent order in a database table. One could argue that you can use the ``id`` field for the ordering, but there are edge cases where this can lead to problems. Therefore, for ordered collection, **always** annotate it with ``@OrderColumn``. An order column indicates to hibernate that we want to order our collection based on a specific column of our data table. By default, the column name it expects is *tablenameS\\_order*. For ordered collections, we also recommend that you annotate it with ``CascadeType.ALL`` and ``orphanRemoval = true``. E.g.:\n+\n+       .. code-block:: java\n+\n+        //Result.java\n+        @OneToMany(mappedBy = \"result\", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)\n+        @OrderColumn\n+        @JsonIgnoreProperties(value = \"result\", allowSetters = true)\n+        @Cache(usage = CacheConcurrencyStrategy.NONSTRICT_READ_WRITE)\n+        @JsonView(QuizView.Before.class)\n+        private List<Feedback> feedbacks = new ArrayList<>();\n+\n+\n+       .. note::\n+        Hiberanate will take care of the ordering for you but you must create the order column in the database. This is not created automatically!\n+\n+\n+    With ordered collections, you have to be very careful with the way you persist the objects in the database. You must first persist the child object without a relation to the parent object. Then, you recreate the association and persist the parent object. Example of how to correctly persist objects in an ordered collection:\n+\n+       .. code-block:: java\n+\n+        // ProgrammingAssessmentService\n+        List<Feedback> savedFeedbacks = new ArrayList<>();\n+        result.getFeedbacks().forEach(feedback -> {\n+               // cut association to parent object\n+               feedback.setResult(null);\n+               // persist the child object without an association to the parent object.

In Java, if a relationship is to a collection of other objects, a ``Collection`` or ``array`` type is used in Java to hold the contents of the relationship. In a relational database, collection relations are either defined by the target objects having a foreign key back to the source object's primary key, or by having an intermediate join table to store the relationship (both objects' primary keys). |br|\n+\n+In this section, we depict common entity relationships we use in Artemis and show some code snippets. \n+\n+* **OneToOne** A unique reference from one object to another.

If you do not need the association to be ordered, then always go for a ``Set`` instead of ``List``. If you are unsure, start with a ``Set``.\u00a0\n+\n+  * **Unordered Collection**: A ``Set`` comes with certain advantages such as ensuring that there are no duplicates and null values in your collection. There are also performance arguments to use a ``Set``, especially for ``@ManyToMany`` relationships. For more information see this `stackoverflow thread <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4655392/which-java-type-do-you-use-for-jpa-collections-and-why>`_. E.g.:\n+\n+       .. code-block:: java\n+\n+        // Course.java\n+        @OneToMany(mappedBy = \"course\", fetch = FetchType.LAZY)\n+        @Cache(usage = CacheConcurrencyStrategy.NONSTRICT_READ_WRITE)\n+        @JsonIgnoreProperties(\"course\")\n+        private Set<Exercise> exercises = new HashSet<>();\n+\n+\n+.. _ordered:\n+\n+  * **Ordered Collection**: When you want to order the collection of objects of the relationship, then always use a ``List``. It is important to note here that there is no inherent order in a database table. One could argue that you can use the ``id`` field for the ordering, but there are edge cases where this can lead to problems. Therefore, for ordered collection, **always** annotate it with ``@OrderColumn``. An order column indicates to hibernate that we want to order our collection based on a specific column of our data table. By default, the column name it expects is *tablenameS\\_order*. For ordered collections, we also recommend that you annotate it with ``CascadeType.ALL`` and ``orphanRemoval = true``. E.g.:\n+\n+       .. code-block:: java\n+\n+        //Result.java\n+        @OneToMany(mappedBy = \"result\", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)\n+        @OrderColumn\n+        @JsonIgnoreProperties(value = \"result\", allowSetters = true)\n+        @Cache(usage = CacheConcurrencyStrategy.NONSTRICT_READ_WRITE)\n+        @JsonView(QuizView.Before.class)\n+        private List<Feedback> feedbacks = new ArrayList<>();\n+\n+\n+       .. note::\n+        Hiberanate will take care of the ordering for you but you must create the order column in the database.

The fetch can be set to either ``LAZY`` or ``EAGER`` as defined in the ``FetchType`` enum. The default fetch type is ``LAZY`` for all relationships except for **OneToOne** and **ManyToOne**, but in general it is a good idea to make every relationship ``LAZY``. The ``EAGER`` default for **OneToOne** and **ManyToOne** is for implementation reasons (more easier to implement), not because it is a good idea. |br|\n+\n+We **always** use ``FetchType.LAZY``, unless there is a very strong case to be made for ``FetchType.EAGER``.\n+\n+       .. note::\n+        Additional effort to use ``FetchType.LAZY`` does count as a strong argument.\n+\n+2. Relationships\n+================\n+\n+A relationship is a reference from one object to another. In a relational database relationships are defined through foreign keys. The source row contains the primary key of the target row to define the relationship (and sometimes the inverse). A query must be performed to read the target objects of the relationship using the foreign key and primary key information. In Java, if a relationship is to a collection of other objects, a ``Collection`` or ``array`` type is used to hold the contents of the relationship. In a relational database, collection relations are either defined by the target objects having a foreign key back to the source object's primary key, or by having an intermediate join table to store the relationship (both objects' primary keys). |br|\n+\n+In this section, we depict common entity relationships we use in Artemis and show some code snippets. \n+\n+* **OneToOne** A unique reference from one object to another. It is also inverse of itself. Example: one ``Complaint`` has a reference to one ``Result``.\n+\n+ .. code:: java\n+\n+    // Complaint.java\n+    @OneToOne\n+    @JoinColumn(unique = true)\n+    private Result result;\n+\n+* **OneToMany** A ``Collection`` or ``Map`` of objects. It is the inverse of a **ManyToOne** relationship. Example: one ``Result`` has a list of ``Feedback`` elements. For ordered OneToMany relations see :ref:`ordered collections <ordered>`.\n+\n+ .. code:: java\n+\n+    // Result.java\n+    @OneToMany(mappedBy = \"result\", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)\n+    @OrderColumn\n+    @JsonIgnoreProperties(value = \"result\", allowSetters = true)\n+    @Cache(usage = CacheConcurrencyStrategy.NONSTRICT_READ_WRITE)\n+    @JsonView(QuizView.Before.class)\n+    private List<Feedback> feedbacks = new ArrayList<>();\n+\n+\n+* **ManyToOne** A reference from one object to another. It is the inverse of an **OneToMany** relationship. Example: one ``Feedback`` has a reference to one ``Result``. \n+\n+ .. code:: java\n+\n+    // Feedback.java\n+    @ManyToOne\n+    @JsonIgnoreProperties(\"feedbacks\")\n+    private Result result;\n+\n+\n+* **ManyToMany** ``A Collection`` or ``Map`` of objects. It is the inverse of itself. Example: one ``Exercise`` has a list of ``LearningGoal`` elements, one ``LearningGoal`` has list of ``Exercise`` elements. In other words: many exercises are connected to many learning goals and vice-versa.\n+\n+ .. code:: java\n+\n+    // Exercise.java\n+    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = \"exercises\")\n+    public Set<LearningGoal> learningGoals = new HashSet<>();\n+\n+    // LearningGoal.java\n+    @ManyToMany\n+    @JoinTable(name = \"learning_goal_exercise\", joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = \"learning_goal_id\", referencedColumnName = \"id\"), inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = \"exercise_id\", referencedColumnName = \"id\"))\n+    @JsonIgnoreProperties(\"learningGoals\")\n+    private Set<Exercise> exercises = new HashSet<>();\n+\n+\n+ .. warning::\n+        For **OneToMany**, **ManyToOne**, and **ManyToMany** relationships you must not forget to mark the associated elements with ``@JsonIgnoreProperties()``. Without this, the object serialization process will be stuck in an endless loop and throw an error. For more information check out the examples listed above and see: `Jackson and JsonIgnoreType <https://www.concretepage.com/jackson-api/jackson-jsonignore-jsonignoreproperties-and-jsonignoretype>`_. \n+\n+\n+2. Cascade Types\n+================\n+Entity relationships often depend on the existence of another entity \u2014 for example, the Result-Feedback relationship. Without the Result, the Feedback entity doesn't have any meaning of its own. When we delete the Result entity, our Feedback entity should also get deleted. For more information see: `jpa cascade types <https://www.baeldung.com/jpa-cascade-types>`_.\n+\n+* ``CascadeType.ALL`` Propagates all operations mentioned below from the parent object to the to child object. \n+\n+ .. code-block:: java\n+\n+    // Result.java\n+    @OneToMany(mappedBy = \"result\", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)\n+    @OrderColumn\n+    @JsonIgnoreProperties(value = \"result\", allowSetters = true)\n+    @Cache(usage = CacheConcurrencyStrategy.NONSTRICT_READ_WRITE)\n+    @JsonView(QuizView.Before.class)\n+    private List<Feedback> feedbacks = new ArrayList<>();\n+\n+\n+* ``CascadeType.PERSIST`` When persisting a parent entity, it also persists the child entities held in its fields. This cascade rule is helpful for relationships where the parent acts as a *container* to the child entity. If you do not use this, you have to ensure that you persist the child entity first, otherwise an error will be thrown. Example: The code below propagates the **persist** operation from parent ``AnswerCounter`` to child ``AnswerOption``. When an ``AnswerCounter`` is persisted, its ``AnswerOption`` is persisted as well.\u00a0\n+\n+ .. code-block:: java\n+\n+    // AnswerCounter.java\n+    @OneToOne(cascade = { CascadeType.PERSIST })\n+    @JoinColumn(unique = true)\n+    private AnswerOption answer;\n+\n+\n+* ``CascadeType.MERGE`` If you merge the source entity (saved/updated/synchronized) to the database, the merge is cascaded to the target of the association. This rule applies to existing objects only. Use this type to always merge/synchronize the existing data in the table with the data in the object. Example below: whenever we merge a ``Result`` to the database, i.e. save the changes on the object, the ``Assessor`` object is also merged/saved.\u00a0\n+\n+ .. code-block:: java\n+\n+    // Result.java\n+    @OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.MERGE, fetch = FetchType.LAZY)\n+    @JoinColumn(unique = false)\n+    private User assessor;\n+\n+\n+* ``CascadeType.REMOVE`` If the source entity is removed, the target of the association is also removed. Example below: propagates **remove** operation from parent ``Submission`` to child ``Result``. When a ``Submission`` is deleted, the corresponding ``Result`` is also deleted.\n+\n+ .. code-block:: java\n+\n+    // Submission.java\n+    @OneToOne(mappedBy = \"submission\", fetch = FetchType.LAZY, cascade = CascadeType.REMOVE)\n+    @JsonIgnoreProperties({ \"submission\", \"participation\" })\n+    @JoinColumn(unique = true)\n+    private Result result;\n+ \n+\n+* ``CascadeType.REFRESH`` If the source entity is refreshed, it cascades the refresh to the target of the association. This is used to refresh the data in the object and its associations. This is useful for cases where there is a change which needs to be synchronized FROM the database.\n+\n+Not used in Artemis yet.\n+\n+\n+Best Practices\n+==============\n+* If you want to create a ``@OneToMany`` relationship or ``@ManyToMany`` relationship, first think about if it is important for the association to be ordered. If you do not need the association to be ordered, then always go for a ``Set`` instead of ``List``. If you are unsure, start with a ``Set``.\u00a0\n+\n+  * **Unordered Collection**: A ``Set`` comes with certain advantages such as ensuring that there are no duplicates and null values in your collection. There are also performance arguments to use a ``Set``, especially for ``@ManyToMany`` relationships. For more information see this `stackoverflow thread <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4655392/which-java-type-do-you-use-for-jpa-collections-and-why>`_. E.g.:\n+\n+       .. code-block:: java\n+\n+        // Course.java\n+        @OneToMany(mappedBy = \"course\", fetch = FetchType.LAZY)\n+        @Cache(usage = CacheConcurrencyStrategy.NONSTRICT_READ_WRITE)\n+        @JsonIgnoreProperties(\"course\")\n+        private Set<Exercise> exercises = new HashSet<>();\n+\n+\n+.. _ordered:\n+\n+  * **Ordered Collection**: When you want to order the collection of objects of the relationship, then always use a ``List``. It is important to note here that there is no inherent order in a database table. One could argue that you can use the ``id`` field for the ordering, but there are edge cases where this can lead to problems. Therefore, for ordered collection, **always** annotate it with ``@OrderColumn``. An order column indicates to hibernate that we want to order our collection based on a specific column of our data table. By default, the column name it expects is *tablenameS\\_order*. For ordered collections, we also recommend that you annotate it with ``CascadeType.ALL`` and ``orphanRemoval = true``.

Example: one ``Complaint`` has a reference to one ``Result``.\n+\n+ .. code:: java\n+\n+    // Complaint.java\n+    @OneToOne\n+    @JoinColumn(unique = true)\n+    private Result result;\n+\n+* **OneToMany** A ``Collection`` or ``Map`` of objects. It is the inverse of a **ManyToOne** relationship. Example: one ``Result`` has a list of ``Feedback`` elements. For ordered OneToMany relations see :ref:`ordered collections <ordered>`.\n+\n+ .. code:: java\n+\n+    // Result.java\n+    @OneToMany(mappedBy = \"result\", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)\n+    @OrderColumn\n+    @JsonIgnoreProperties(value = \"result\", allowSetters = true)\n+    @Cache(usage = CacheConcurrencyStrategy.NONSTRICT_READ_WRITE)\n+    @JsonView(QuizView.Before.class)\n+    private List<Feedback> feedbacks = new ArrayList<>();\n+\n+\n+* **ManyToOne** A reference from one object to another. It is the inverse of an **OneToMany** relationship. Example: one ``Feedback`` has a reference to one ``Result``. \n+\n+ .. code:: java\n+\n+    // Feedback.java\n+    @ManyToOne\n+    @JsonIgnoreProperties(\"feedbacks\")\n+    private Result result;\n+\n+\n+* **ManyToMany** ``A Collection`` or ``Map`` of objects. It is the inverse of itself. Example: one ``Exercise`` has a list of ``LearningGoal`` elements, one ``LearningGoal`` has list of ``Exercise`` elements. In other words: many exercises are connected to many learning goals and vice-versa.\n+\n+ .. code:: java\n+\n+    // Exercise.java\n+    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = \"exercises\")\n+    public Set<LearningGoal> learningGoals = new HashSet<>();\n+\n+    // LearningGoal.java\n+    @ManyToMany\n+    @JoinTable(name = \"learning_goal_exercise\", joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = \"learning_goal_id\", referencedColumnName = \"id\"), inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = \"exercise_id\", referencedColumnName = \"id\"))\n+    @JsonIgnoreProperties(\"learningGoals\")\n+    private Set<Exercise> exercises = new HashSet<>();\n+\n+\n+ .. warning::\n+        For **OneToMany**, **ManyToOne**, and **ManyToMany** relationships you must not forget to mark the associated elements with ``@JsonIgnoreProperties()``. Without this, the object serialization process will be stuck in an endless loop and throw an error.

Cascade Types\n+================\n+Entity relationships often depend on the existence of another entity \u2014 for example, the Result-Feedback relationship. Without the Result, the Feedback entity doesn't have any meaning of its own. When we delete the Result entity, our Feedback entity should also get deleted. For more information see: `jpa cascade types <https://www.baeldung.com/jpa-cascade-types>`_.\n+\n+* ``CascadeType.ALL`` Propagates all operations mentioned below from the parent object to the to child object. \n+\n+ .. code-block:: java\n+\n+    // Result.java\n+    @OneToMany(mappedBy = \"result\", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)\n+    @OrderColumn\n+    @JsonIgnoreProperties(value = \"result\", allowSetters = true)\n+    @Cache(usage = CacheConcurrencyStrategy.NONSTRICT_READ_WRITE)\n+    @JsonView(QuizView.Before.class)\n+    private List<Feedback> feedbacks = new ArrayList<>();\n+\n+\n+* ``CascadeType.PERSIST`` When persisting a parent entity, it also persists the child entities held in its fields. This cascade rule is helpful for relationships where the parent acts as a *container* to the child entity. If you do not use this, you have to ensure that you persist the child entity first, otherwise an error will be thrown. Example: The code below propagates the **persist** operation from parent ``AnswerCounter`` to child ``AnswerOption``. When an ``AnswerCounter`` is persisted, its ``AnswerOption`` is persisted as well.\u00a0\n+\n+ .. code-block:: java\n+\n+    // AnswerCounter.java\n+    @OneToOne(cascade = { CascadeType.PERSIST })\n+    @JoinColumn(unique = true)\n+    private AnswerOption answer;\n+\n+\n+* ``CascadeType.MERGE`` If you merge the source entity (saved/updated/synchronized) to the database, the merge is cascaded to the target of the association. This rule applies to existing objects only. Use this type to always merge/synchronize the existing data in the table with the data in the object. Example below: whenever we merge a ``Result`` to the database, i.e. save the changes on the object, the ``Assessor`` object is also merged/saved.\u00a0\n+\n+ .. code-block:: java\n+\n+    // Result.java\n+    @OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.MERGE, fetch = FetchType.LAZY)\n+    @JoinColumn(unique = false)\n+    private User assessor;\n+\n+\n+* ``CascadeType.REMOVE`` If the source entity is removed, the target of the association is also removed. Example below: propagates **remove** operation from parent ``Submission`` to child ``Result``. When a ``Submission`` is deleted, the corresponding ``Result`` is also deleted.\n+\n+ .. code-block:: java\n+\n+    // Submission.java\n+    @OneToOne(mappedBy = \"submission\", fetch = FetchType.LAZY, cascade = CascadeType.REMOVE)\n+    @JsonIgnoreProperties({ \"submission\", \"participation\" })\n+    @JoinColumn(unique = true)\n+    private Result result;\n+ \n+\n+* ``CascadeType.REFRESH`` If the source entity is refreshed, it cascades the refresh to the target of the association. This is used to refresh the data in the object and its associations. This is useful for cases where there is a change which needs to be synchronized FROM the database.\n+\n+Not used in Artemis yet.\n+\n+\n+Best Practices\n+==============\n+* If you want to create a ``@OneToMany`` relationship or ``@ManyToMany`` relationship, first think about if it is important for the association to be ordered. If you do not need the association to be ordered, then always go for a ``Set`` instead of ``List``. If you are unsure, start with a ``Set``.\u00a0\n+\n+  * **Unordered Collection**: A ``Set`` comes with certain advantages such as ensuring that there are no duplicates and null values in your collection. There are also performance arguments to use a ``Set``, especially for ``@ManyToMany`` relationships. For more information see this `stackoverflow thread <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4655392/which-java-type-do-you-use-for-jpa-collections-and-why>`_. E.g.:\n+\n+       .. code-block:: java\n+\n+        // Course.java\n+        @OneToMany(mappedBy = \"course\", fetch = FetchType.LAZY)\n+        @Cache(usage = CacheConcurrencyStrategy.NONSTRICT_READ_WRITE)\n+        @JsonIgnoreProperties(\"course\")\n+        private Set<Exercise> exercises = new HashSet<>();\n+\n+\n+.. _ordered:\n+\n+  * **Ordered Collection**: When you want to order the collection of objects of the relationship, then always use a ``List``. It is important to note here that there is no inherent order in a database table. One could argue that you can use the ``id`` field for the ordering, but there are edge cases where this can lead to problems. Therefore, for a ordered collection, **always** annotate it with ``@OrderColumn``. An order column indicates to hibernate that we want to order our collection based on a specific column of our data table. By default, the column name it expects is *tablenameS\\_order*. For ordered collections, we also recommend that you annotate them with ``CascadeType.ALL`` and ``orphanRemoval = true``. E.g.:\n+\n+       .. code-block:: java\n+\n+        //Result.java\n+        @OneToMany(mappedBy = \"result\", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)\n+        @OrderColumn\n+        @JsonIgnoreProperties(value = \"result\", allowSetters = true)\n+        @Cache(usage = CacheConcurrencyStrategy.NONSTRICT_READ_WRITE)\n+        @JsonView(QuizView.Before.class)\n+        private List<Feedback> feedbacks = new ArrayList<>();\n+\n+\n+       .. note::\n+        Hibernate will take care of the ordering for you but you must create the order column in the database. This is not created automatically!\n+\n+\n+    With ordered collections, you have to be very careful with the way you persist the objects in the database. You must first persist the child object without a relation to the parent object. Then, you recreate the association and persist the parent object. Example of how to correctly persist objects in an ordered collection:\n+\n+       .. code-block:: java\n+\n+        // ProgrammingAssessmentService\n+        List<Feedback> savedFeedbacks = new ArrayList<>();\n+        result.getFeedbacks().forEach(feedback -> {\n+           // cut association to parent object\n+           feedback.setResult(null);\n+           // persist the child object without an association to the parent object. IMPORTANT: Use the object returned from the database!\n+           feedback = feedbackRepository.save(feedback);\n+           // restore the association to the parent object\n+           feedback.setResult(result);\n+           savedFeedbacks.add(feedback);\n+       });\n+       ", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "7656ecb2966524e50cbdadd6b6b9cc91e786f11a"}, "originalPosition": 179}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "61720d37a7ba52b2bbbcb433220268d3882a41fb", "author": {"user": {"login": "anditurdiu", "name": "Andi Turdiu"}}, "url": "https://github.com/ls1intum/Artemis/commit/61720d37a7ba52b2bbbcb433220268d3882a41fb", "committedDate": "2020-11-24T11:14:11Z", "message": "Update database.rst"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "e56ec3f2ed8b6d0083ef515321142acfe8b4125c", "author": {"user": null}, "url": "https://github.com/ls1intum/Artemis/commit/e56ec3f2ed8b6d0083ef515321142acfe8b4125c", "committedDate": "2020-11-24T14:25:48Z", "message": "Fix github actions warning & add feedback"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "cf269c7dc128b5075c973f51d65bb863b0fb61e9", "author": {"user": null}, "url": "https://github.com/ls1intum/Artemis/commit/cf269c7dc128b5075c973f51d65bb863b0fb61e9", "committedDate": "2020-11-24T14:29:38Z", "message": "add feedback"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NTM3NTcwNTk2", "url": "https://github.com/ls1intum/Artemis/pull/2430#pullrequestreview-537570596", "createdAt": "2020-11-24T14:52:44Z", "commit": {"oid": "cf269c7dc128b5075c973f51d65bb863b0fb61e9"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0yNFQxNDo1Mjo0NFrOH5Eg7g==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0yNFQxNDo1Mjo0NFrOH5Eg7g==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyOTYwNDg0Ng==", "bodyText": "Why is this .. ordered: needed?", "url": "https://github.com/ls1intum/Artemis/pull/2430#discussion_r529604846", "createdAt": "2020-11-24T14:52:44Z", "author": {"login": "JannisBittlmayer"}, "path": "docs/dev/guidelines/database.rst", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,226 @@\n+**********************\n+Database Relationships\n+**********************\n+\n+WORK IN PROGRESS\n+\n+1. Retrieving and Building Objects\n+==================================\n+\n+The cost of retrieving and building an object's relationships far exceeds the cost of selecting the object. This is especially true for relationships where it would trigger the loading of every child through the relationship hierarchy. The solution to this issue is **lazy fetching** (lazy loading). Lazy fetching allows the fetching of a relationship to be deferred until it is accessed. This is important not only to avoid the database access, but also to avoid the cost of building the objects if they are not needed. |br|\n+\n+In JPA lazy fetching can be set on any relationship using the fetch attribute. The fetch can be set to either ``LAZY`` or ``EAGER`` as defined in the ``FetchType`` enum. The default fetch type is ``LAZY`` for all relationships except for **OneToOne** and **ManyToOne**, but in general it is a good idea to make every relationship ``LAZY``. The ``EAGER`` default for **OneToOne** and **ManyToOne** is for implementation reasons (more easier to implement), not because it is a good idea. |br|\n+\n+We **always** use ``FetchType.LAZY``, unless there is a very strong case to be made for ``FetchType.EAGER``.\n+\n+       .. note::\n+        Additional effort to use ``FetchType.LAZY`` does not count as a strong argument.\n+\n+2. Relationships\n+================\n+\n+A relationship is a reference from one object to another. In a relational database relationships are defined through foreign keys. The source row contains the primary key of the target row to define the relationship (and sometimes the inverse). A query must be performed to read the target objects of the relationship using the foreign key and primary key information. If there is a relationship to a collection of other objects, a ``Collection`` or ``array`` type is used to hold the contents of the relationship. In a relational database, collection relations are either defined by the target objects having a foreign key back to the source object's primary key, or by having an intermediate join table to store the relationship (containing both objects' primary keys). |br|\n+\n+In this section, we depict common entity relationships we use in Artemis and show some code snippets. \n+\n+* **OneToOne** A unique reference from one object to another.
