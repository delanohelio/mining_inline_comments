resources contains file descriptor tables and thread allocations, and are limited on the workers, because workers tend to have fewer concurrent accesses compared to master.

fail.\n+Unfortunately, it is difficult to know much memory a query will need unless you run it.\n+Tools such as top can be used to monitor the peak memory consumptions of the presto process.\n+ALLUXIO_WORKER_HEAP_SIZE does not need to be very large, but it is critical to ensure it is enough for the correct operation of the Alluxio worker.\n+The last priority should be the
