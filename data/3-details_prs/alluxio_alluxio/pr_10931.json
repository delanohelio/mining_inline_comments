Changes should be grouped by project components or in another logical way which makes the design easy to follow.\n+If applicable, the design should be broken down into separate phases which each delivers incremental value. The first phase should achieve the minimum requirements outlined in the goals.\n+If applicable, alternative approaches should be noted and evaluated for different sections of the design.\n+\n+##\tAPI Changes\n+This is a section detailing any user facing or internal APIs added to components, including configuration changes.

Create a Github issue in [Alluxio repository](https://github.com/Alluxio/alluxio/issues) regarding your feature.\n+1. Attach a feature design document following the \n+[template]({{ '/templates/Design-Document-Template.md' | relativize_url }})\n+in your Github issue. The design document should follow the template and provide information regarding each section.\n+We recommend using a public Google doc for more efficient collaboration and discussions.\n+If a Google doc is not an option for you, you can choose to attach either a Markdown file or a PDF file for \n+the design document.\n+1.

The reviewers (assignees on the corresponding Github issue or the reviewers of the pull request) will review\n+the feature design document and provide feedback or request for iterations.\n+Please feel free to raise questions and seek help from the reviewers and community members, \n+if you are uncertain about specific design decisions. \n+Please also list options for the feature and corresponding pros and cons.\n+1. After a few iterations on the design document, reviewers will give an **LGTM** to the design document.\n+And this feature can move on to the implementation phase.\n+1. Fork Alluxio repository, implement your feature and create a pull request, \n+as you have mastered in the previous section. Please also link to the issue and design document in your pull request.\n+1. After your pull request is reviewed and merged, you have contributed your feature to Alluxio. Cheers!\n+1.
