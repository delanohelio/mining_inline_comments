to know but the process will still continue running.\n+- `ERROR`: system errors that users should pay attention to.\n+\n+By default, Alluxio server processes write logs at level `INFO`, which includes all events at level `INFO`, `WARN` and `ERROR`.\n+\n+\n+### Modifying Logging with `log4j.properties`\n+\n+You can modify `${ALLUXIO_HOME}/conf/log4j.properties` to customize logging levels.\n+\n+For example, to modify the level for all logs to `DEBUG`, change the\n+`rootLogger` level by modifying the first line of `log4j.properties`:\n+\n+```properties\n+log4j.rootLogger=DEBUG,
