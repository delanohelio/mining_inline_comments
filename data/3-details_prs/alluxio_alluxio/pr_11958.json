Concurrency is typically considered at a per node level.\n+\n+Calculating concurrent clients requires estimating the number of Alluxio clients in the deployment.\n+This can typically be attributed to the number of threads allowed in the compute frameworks used.\n+For example, the number of tasks in a Presto job or the number of slots in a MapReduce node.\n+\n+#### Master\n+\n+Client connections to the master are short lived, so we first estimate the number of concurrent\n+clients and then convert to a operations/second metric\n+* 1 per Alluxio worker in the cluster\n+* Max of\n+\t* Number of concurrent clients of the system as calculated above\n+\t* (alluxio.worker.block.master.client.pool.size + alluxio.user.file.master.client.pool.size.max)\n+\tper user per service using the Alluxio client\n+\n+For example, in a deployment with 2 users, 50 Presto worker nodes (with 200 task concurrency), and\n+50 Alluxio nodes, the estimations would come out to the following\n+* 50 (workers) + 2 (users) x 11 (block pool size) x 10 (file pool size) x 50 (services) = 11050\n+* 50 (workers) + 50 (Presto workers) x 200 (task concurrency) = 10050\n+\n+Yielding a max of 11050\n+\n+Note based on the number of concurrent queries, add 1 more service for each to account for the\n+Presto coordinator\u2019s connections.\n+\n+If a maximum latency of 1 second is expected at absolute peak capacity, the master would need to\n+support about 11050 operations per second. The typical operation to benchmark is `getFileInfo` for\n+OLAP frameworks. Note that although the number of potential concurrent clients are high, it is\n+unlikely for all clients to simultaneously hit the master. The steady state number of concurrent\n+clients to the master is generally much lower.\n+\n+The number of concurrent clients to the master impacts the following\n+* Number of cores required by the master - We recommend 8 clients per core, or to determine the\n+number of cores based on required operation throughput.\n+* Number of open files allowed on the master - We recommend about 4 open files per expected\n+concurrent client.

The sections\n+[Alluxio Master Configuration](#alluxio-master-configuration),\n+[Alluxio Worker Configuration](#alluxio-worker-configuration), and\n+[Alluxio Client Configuration](#alluxio-client-configuration) provide details on hardware and\n+configuration tuning for large scale deployments.\n \n * Table of Contents\n {:toc}\n \n+## Metrics To Monitor\n+\n+### Number of Files in Alluxio\n+\n+Files refers to files and directories. The number of files in Alluxio can be monitored through the\n+metrics `Master.FilesCreated` plus `Master.DirectoriesCreated` minus `Master.PathsDeleted`. These\n+metric will need to be aggregated by a third party metrics collector because the value will reset on\n+each master restart or failover.\n+\n+The number of files in Alluxio impacts the following:\n+* Size of heap required by the master - Each file takes approximately 1 - 2 kb. If RocksDB is used,\n+most file metadata is stored off-heap, and the size of the heap impacts how many files\u2019 metadata can\n+be cached on heap.

This should not impact\n+user experience unless the subtree is significantly large (> 10k files).\n+\n+### Number of Concurrent Clients\n+\n+Concurrent clients represents number of logical Alluxio clients communicating with the Alluxio\n+Master or Worker. Concurrency is typically considered at a per node level.\n+\n+Calculating concurrent clients requires estimating the number of Alluxio clients in the deployment.\n+This can typically be attributed to the number of threads allowed in the compute frameworks used.\n+For example, the number of tasks in a Presto job or the number of slots in a MapReduce node.\n+\n+#### Master\n+\n+Client connections to the master are short lived, so we first estimate the number of concurrent\n+clients and then convert to a operations/second metric\n+* 1 per Alluxio worker in the cluster\n+* Max of\n+\t* Number of concurrent clients of the system as calculated above\n+\t* (alluxio.worker.block.master.client.pool.size + alluxio.user.file.master.client.pool.size.max)\n+\tper user per service using the Alluxio client\n+\n+For example, in a deployment with 2 users, 50 Presto worker nodes (with 200 task concurrency), and\n+50 Alluxio nodes, the estimations would come out to the following\n+* 50 (workers) + 2 (users) x 11 (block pool size) x 10 (file pool size) x 50 (services) = 11050\n+* 50 (workers) + 50 (Presto workers) x 200 (task concurrency) = 10050\n+\n+Yielding a max of 11050\n+\n+Note based on the number of concurrent queries, add 1 more service for each to account for the\n+Presto coordinator\u2019s connections.\n+\n+If a maximum latency of 1 second is expected at absolute peak capacity, the master would need to\n+support about 11050 operations per second. The typical operation to benchmark is `getFileInfo` for\n+OLAP frameworks. Note that although the number of potential concurrent clients are high, it is\n+unlikely for all clients to simultaneously hit the master. The steady state number of concurrent\n+clients to the master is generally much lower.\n+\n+The number of concurrent clients to the master impacts the following\n+* Number of cores required by the master - We recommend 8 clients per core, or to determine the\n+number of cores based on required operation throughput.\n+* Number of open files allowed on the master - We recommend about 4 open files per expected\n+concurrent client. On Linux machines this can be set by modifying `/etc/security/limits.d` and\n+checked with the `ulimit` command.\n+\n+### Worker", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "83680b1eb69f04c6ea908cdf193ed1d5767bbeed"}, "originalPosition": 84}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDY1NTMwMjA5", "url": "https://github.com/Alluxio/alluxio/pull/11958#pullrequestreview-465530209", "createdAt": "2020-08-12T01:21:51Z", "commit": {"oid": "83680b1eb69f04c6ea908cdf193ed1d5767bbeed"}, "state": "CHANGES_REQUESTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 0, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": null, "endCursor": null, "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": []}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "cbf917c37e32427efb332eb7e9c80dcdc9051ec3", "author": {"user": {"login": "calvinjia", "name": "Calvin Jia"}}, "url": "https://github.com/Alluxio/alluxio/commit/cbf917c37e32427efb332eb7e9c80dcdc9051ec3", "committedDate": "2020-08-12T16:30:38Z", "message": "Address comments."}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDY4NzQ0NzY5", "url": "https://github.com/Alluxio/alluxio/pull/11958#pullrequestreview-468744769", "createdAt": "2020-08-17T18:42:29Z", "commit": {"oid": "cbf917c37e32427efb332eb7e9c80dcdc9051ec3"}, "state": "APPROVED", "comments": {"totalCount": 0, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": null, "endCursor": null, "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": []}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 4116, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-10-29T17:30:11Z"}}}
