So for applications talking to Alluxio, they will always see the latest update as long as the write operation complete successfully.\nHowever, for users or applications taking the state in UFS into account, it might be different across write types:\n\nMUST_CACHE writes no data to UFS, so Alluxio space is never consistent with UFS\nCACHE_THROUGH writes data synchronously to Alluxio and UFS before returning success to applications. If writing to UFS is also strong consistent (e.g., HDFS), Alluxio space will be always consistent with UFS; if writing to UFS is eventual consistent (e.g. S3), it is possible that the file is written successfully to Alluxio but shown up in UFS later.\nASYNC_THROUGH writes data to Alluxio and return to applications, leaving Alluxio to propagate the data to UFS asynchronously. From users perspective, the file can be written successfully to Alluxio, but get persisted in UFS later.\nTHROUGH writes data to UFS directly without caching the data in Alluxio, however, Alluxio knows the files and its status.
