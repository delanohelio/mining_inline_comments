It is used to map terminology concepts, represented by various TRM_CONCEPT_* tables to a single CodeSystem resource.\n+\n+The TRM_CODESYSTEM table represents the canonical representation of a CodeSystem resource with a specific URL and maps to a single TRM_CODESYSTEM_VER row which is treated as the current version of the CodeSystem (i.e. the resource referenced if no version is specified). For example, two CodeSystem resources `CodeSystem/loinc-2.67` and `CodeSystem/loinc-2.68` might have the same CodeSystem.url, e.g. `http://loinc.org` but different CodeSystem.version values. In this case each will each have exactly one row in the TRM_CODESYSTEM_VER table, but there will be only one row in the TRM_CODESYSTEM table which will link only to the more recently updated TRM_CODESYSTEM_VER resource.\n+\n+### Columns\n+\n+The following list are the main key columns in the TRM_CODESYSTEM_VER table that are used to join to the TRM_CODESYSTEM table and TRM_CONCEPT_* tables.\n+\n+<table class=\"table table-striped table-condensed\">\n+    <thead>\n+        <tr>\n+            <th>Name</th>\n+            <th>Relationships</th>\n+            <th>Datatype</th>\n+            <th>Nullable</th>\n+            <th>Description</th>\n+        </tr>\n+    </thead>\n+    <tbody>\n+        <tr>\n+            <td>PID</td>\n+            <td></td>\n+            <td>Long</td>\n+            <td></td>\n+            <td>\n+                Persistent ID of the TRM_CODESYSTEM_VER row.\n+            </td>\n+        </tr>\n+        <tr>\n+            <td>RES_ID</td>\n+            <td></td>\n+            <td>Long</td>\n+            <td></td>\n+            <td>\n+                Persistent ID of the CodeSystem resource in the HFJ_RESOURCE table.\n+            </td>\n+        </tr>\n+        <tr>\n+            <td>CODESYSTEM_PID</td>\n+            <td></td>\n+            <td>Long</td>\n+            <td>Nullable</td>\n+            <td>\n+                Persistent ID of the TRM_CODESYSTEM row for the canonical representation of this CodeSystem resource.\n+            </td>\n+        </tr>\n+        <tr>\n+            <td>CS_VERSION_ID</td>\n+            <td></td>\n+            <td>Long</td>\n+            <td>Nullable</td>\n+            <td>\n+                CodeSystem.version of the CodeSystem resource.\n+            </td>\n+        </tr>\n+    </tbody>\n+</table>\n+\n+The TRM_CODESYSTEM_VER table will have exactly one row for each unique combination of CODESYSTEM_PID and CS_VERSION_ID.\n+\n+The following list are the main key columns in the TRM_CODESYSTEM table.\n+\n+<table class=\"table table-striped table-condensed\">\n+    <thead>\n+        <tr>\n+            <th>Name</th>\n+            <th>Relationships</th>\n+            <th>Datatype</th>\n+            <th>Nullable</th>\n+            <th>Description</th>\n+        </tr>\n+    </thead>\n+    <tbody>\n+        <tr>\n+            <td>PID</td>\n+            <td></td>\n+            <td>Long</td>\n+            <td></td>\n+            <td>\n+                Persistent ID of the TRM_CODESYSTEM row.\n+            </td>\n+        </tr>\n+        <tr>\n+            <td>CODE_SYSTEM_URI</td>\n+            <td></td>\n+            <td>String</td>\n+            <td></td>\n+            <td>\n+                URL of the CodeSystem resource.\n+            </td>\n+        </tr>\n+        <tr>\n+            <td>CURRENT_VERSION_PID</td>\n+            <td></td>\n+            <td>Long</td>\n+            <td>Nullable</td>\n+            <td>\n+                Persistent ID of the TRM_CODESYSTEM_VER row for the most recently updated version of the CodeSystem resource for this URL.\n+            </td>\n+        </tr>\n+        <tr>\n+            <td>CS_NAME</td>\n+            <td></td>\n+            <td>String</td>\n+            <td>Nullable</td>\n+            <td>\n+                CodeSystem.name value for this CodeSystem resource.\n+            </td>\n+        </tr>\n+        <tr>\n+            <td>RES_ID</td>\n+            <td></td>\n+            <td>Long</td>\n+            <td>Nullable</td>\n+            <td>\n+                Persistent ID of the most recently updated version of the CodeSystem resource for this URL in the HFJ_RESOURCE table.\n+            </td>\n+        </tr>\n+    </tbody>\n+</table>\n+\n+The TRM_CODESYSTEM table will have exactly one row for each unique CODE_SYSTEM_URI value.\n+\n+## ValueSet Tables\n+\n+<img src=\"/hapi-fhir/docs/images/termvalueset_schema.svg\" alt=\"Resources\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 600px;\"/>\n+\n+The TRM_VALUESET table represents a single ValueSet resource with a specific URL and version.
