For example:\n+\n+* Partitioning could be used to achieve **multitenancy**, where there are multiple logically separate pools of resources on the server. Traditionally this kind of setup is desired when each of these pools belongs to a distinct user group / organization / customer / etc. (a \"tenant\"), and each of these tenants should not be able to access or modify data belonging to anther tenant.\n+\n+* Partitioning could also be used to **logically separate data coming from distinct sources** within an organization. For example, patient records might be placed in one partition, lab data sourced from a lab system might be placed in a second partition and patient surveys from a survey app might be placed in another. In this situation data does not need to be completely segregated (lab Observation records may have references to Patient records in the patient partition) but these partitions might be used to create security groups, retention policies, etc.\n+\n+* Partitioning could be used for **geographic sharding**, keeping data in a partition that is geographically closest to where it is likely to be used.\n+\n+These examples each have different properties in terms of security rules, and how data is organized and searched.\n+\n+# Architecture\n+\n+## Conceptual Architecture\n+\n+Partitioning in HAPI FHIR JPA means that every resource has a partition identity. This identity consists of the following attributes:\n+\n+* **Partition Name**: This is a short textual identifier for the partition that the resource belongs to. This might be a customer ID, a description of the type of data in the partition, or something else. There is no restriction on the text used aside from a maximum length of 200, but generally it makes sense to limit the text to URL-friendly characters.\n+\n+* **Partition ID**: This is an integer ID that corresponds 1:1 with the partition Name. It is used in the database as the partition identifier.   \n+\n+* **Partition Date**: This is an additional partition discriminator that can be used to implement partitioning strategies using a date axis.\n+\n+Mappings between the **Partition Name** and the **Partition ID** are maintained using the [Partition Mapping Operations](#partition-mapping-operations).\n+\n+## Logical Architecture\n+\n+At the database level, partitioning involves the use of two dedicated columns to many tables within the HAPI FHIR JPA [database schema](./schema.html):\n+\n+* **PARTITION_ID** &ndash; This is an integer indicating the specific partition that a given resource is placed in. This column can also be *NULL*, meaning that the given resource is in the **Default Partition**.\n+* **PARTITION_DATE** &ndash; This is a date/time column that can be assigned an arbitrary value depending on your use case. Typically, this would be used for use cases where data should be automatically dropped after a certain time period using native database partition drops. \n+\n+When partitioning is used, these two columns will be populated with the same value on all resource-specific tables (this includes [HFJ_RESOURCE](./schema.html#HFJ_RESOURCE) and all tables that have a foreign key relationship to it including [HFJ_RES_VER](./schema.html#HFJ_RES_VER), [HFJ_RESLINK](./schema.html#HFJ_RES_LINK), [HFJ_SPIDX_*](./schema.html#search-indexes), etc.)\n+\n+At the time that a resource is being **created**, an [interceptor hook](#partition-interceptors) is invoked in order to request the partition ID and date, and these will be written to the resource.\n+\n+At the time that a resource is being **updated**, the partition ID and date from the previous version will be used.\n+\n+When a **read operation** is being performed (e.g. a read, search, history, etc.), a separate [interceptor hook](#partition-interceptors) is invoked in order to determine whether the operation should target a specific partition. The outcome of this hook determines how the partitioning manifests itself to the end user: \n+\n+* If all read operations are scoped by the interceptor to only apply to a single partition, then the partitioning behaves as a **multitenant** solution.\n+* If read operations are scopes to all partitions, then the partitioning is simply partitioning the data into logical segments.\n+\n+# Enabling Partitioning in HAPI FHIR\n+\n+Enabling partitioning on the server involves a set of steps.\n+\n+The [PartitionConfig](/apidocs/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-model/ca/uhn/fhir/jpa/model/config/PartitionConfig.html) bean contains configuration settings related to partitioning within the server. To enable partitioning, the [setPartitioningEnabled(boolean)](/apidocs/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-model/ca/uhn/fhir/jpa/model/config/PartitionConfig.html#setPartitioningEnabled(boolean)) property should be enabled.\n+\n+The following settings can be enabled:\n+\n+* **Include Partition in Search Hashes** ([JavaDoc](/apidocs/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-model/ca/uhn/fhir/jpa/model/config/PartitionConfig.html#setIncludePartitionInSearchHashes(boolean))): If this feature is enabled, partition IDs will be factored into [Search Hashes](./schema.html#search-hashes). When this flag is not set (as is the default), when a search requests a specific partition, an additional SQL WHERE predicate is added to the query to explicitly request the given partition ID. When this flag is set, this additional WHERE predicate is not necessary since the partition is factored into the hash value being searched on. Setting this flag avoids the need to manually adjust indexes against the HFJ_SPIDX tables. Note that this flag should **not be used in environments where partitioning is being used for security purposes**, since it is possible for a user to reverse engineer false hash collisions.\n+\n+* **Cross-Partition Reference Mode**: ([JavaDoc](/apidocs/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-model/ca/uhn/fhir/jpa/model/config/PartitionConfig.html#setAllowReferencesAcrossPartitions(ca.uhn.fhir.jpa.model.config.PartitionSettings.CrossPartitionReferenceMode))): This setting controls whether resources in one partition should be allowed to create references to resources in other partitions.\n+\n+\n+# Partition Interceptors\n+\n+In order to implement partitioning, an interceptor must be registered against the interceptor registry (either the REST Server registry, or the JPA Server registry will work).\n+\n+This interceptor can implement the hooks shown below.\n+\n+## Identify Partition for Create (Required)\n+\n+A hook against the [`Pointcut.STORAGE_PARTITION_IDENTIFY_CREATE`](/apidocs/hapi-fhir-base/ca/uhn/fhir/interceptor/api/Pointcut.html#STORAGE_PARTITION_IDENTIFY_CREATE) pointcut must be registered, and this hook method will be invoked every time a resource is being created in order to determine the partition to create the resource in.\n+\n+The criteria for determining the partition will depend on your use case.

Over time the HAPI FHIR team are hoping to make all of these features partition aware.\n+\n+* **Server Capability Statement is not partition aware**: The server creates and exposes a single server capability statement, covering all partitions. This can be misleading when partitioning us used as a multitenancy strategy. \n+\n+* **Subscriptions may not be partitioned**: All subscriptions must be placed in the default partition, and subscribers will receive deliveries for any matching resources from all partitions.\n+\n+* **Conformance resources may not be partitioned**: The following resources must be placed in the default partition, and will be shared for any validation activities across all partitions:\n+   * StructureDefinition\n+   * Questionnaire\n+   * ValueSet\n+   * CodeSystem\n+   * ConceptMap\n+\n+* **Search Parameters are not partitioned**: There is only one set of SearchParameter resources for the entire system, and any search parameters will apply to resources in all partitions.

Note that columns are shown using Java datatypes as opposed to SQL datatypes, because the exact SQL datatype used will vary depending on the underlying database platform. \n+\n+# Background: Persistent IDs (PIDs)\n+\n+The HAPI FHIR JPA schema relies heavily on the concept of internal persistent IDs on tables, using a Java type of Long (8-byte integer, which translates to an *int8* or *number(19)* on various database platforms).\n+\n+Many tables use an internal persistent ID as their primary key, allowing the flexibility for other more complex business identifiers to be changed and minimizing the amount of data consumed by foreign key relationships.
