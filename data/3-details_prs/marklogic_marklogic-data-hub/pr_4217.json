Now, in theory, the query shouldn't happen that often - it would seem rare for a user to have more than a dozen flows, and for each of those flows to average a dozen or more steps. So if we're running this query 10 to 20 times on each call, it shouldn't add that much overhead.\nBut, perhaps the performance is slightly worse because we're hitting a separate database. And we're also getting this job data every single time we get flows for the UI.\nI think before we go forward, we need to review the requirement to verify that it's worth doing this. The \"when\" in the scenario isn't valid - \"When I look at the step in the Run tile\" - that's not an event that the computer knows about. The way this implemented, it's assuming a \"when\" of \"When I click on the Run tile\" (or do something that causes the Run tile to be displayed). And is it true that we want job data every time this \"when\" happens? I don't know.\n@srinathgit  Can you organize a quick call with myself and Ryan and Justin to determine what the \"when\" should really be here?

If it exists, you call getArtifact, else getArtifacts. Then the same code can be used for constructing the flow with all the steps. And then in this endpoint, you take the result and add the job data for the single flow.\nThat'll cut down on the duplication, and I think it'll be good to start a pattern of having a library in a DS folder for reusable code.
