That's an easy change, since HC doesn't need any of the HubProject stuff in HubConfig.\nNote that AbstractHubCentralTest still has a HubProject, since tests are like Pari - they need to be able to deploy apps for testing.\nThen changed the following HC core classes:\n\nHubConfig now has newHubClient, as HubConfig has all the config needed to know how to create a HubClient\nSaw an unused method in HubProjectImpl, removed it\nCollectorImpl now gets a RestTemplate from HubClient. Removed 4 methods from the Collector interface that were not invoked anywhere too.\nQueryStepRunner now depends on a HubClient and a sourceDatabase. The latter is used to control which database is sent to the collector endpoint. The RestTemplate still always talks to the staging app server when hitting the collector, which is now more clear in the code.\nWriteStepRunner now uses getFinalClient() when an ingestion wants to write to the final database. Wasn't sure if this was tested anywhere, so added IngestInFinalTest to verify it works.\nRemoved \"withSourceClient\" from StepRunner, as that concept no longer exists. It only applied to QueryStepRunner, and QueryStepRunner will always use getStagingClient() to talk to the collector and mlRunFlow endpoints.\n\nDescription\nChecklist:\n- Note: do not change the below\n\n\nOwner:\n\n\n JIRA_ID included in all the commit messages\n\n\n PR title is in the format JIRA_ID:Title\n\n\n Rebase the branch with upstream\n\n\n Squashed all commits into a single commit\n\n\n Added Tests\n\n\nReviewer:\n\n\n Reviewed Tests", "createdAt": "2020-04-24T18:54:03Z", "url": "https://github.com/marklogic/marklogic-data-hub/pull/3869", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "b5a9192f6c221c163c5478aeb75502362391146f"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-04-27T19:07:38Z", "author": {"login": "rjrudin"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 5, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABca2KW5ABqjMyNzA2NDY2NTY=", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABcboZhZgFqTQwMDYzNDcxMA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "HeadRefForcePushedEvent", "beforeCommit": {"oid": "85a0c2047b3bdd61820bebfd46eb7f2484cb39a2", "author": {"user": {"login": "rjrudin", "name": null}}, "url": "https://github.com/marklogic/marklogic-data-hub/commit/85a0c2047b3bdd61820bebfd46eb7f2484cb39a2", "committedDate": "2020-04-24T18:54:19Z", "message": "DHFPROD: Introducing HubClient as a simplified interface\n\nMost of the changes in here are switching HC code over from HubConfig to HubClient.
