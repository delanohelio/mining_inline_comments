And then I was thinking that a Manager would be a layer on top that provides additional Java-based logic on top of one or more Services. But that conflicts with this usage of Service here, since it's the Service on top with Manager and other components (e.g. FlowRunner) below it.\nThat said, I'm not sure how to resolve this. My initial thought is that perhaps the logic in here should move into FlowManager and FlowRunner.
