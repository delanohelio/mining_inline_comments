Something like:\n# Ensure list of Curation Tasks (defined above) is available via the REST API /api/config/properties endpoint\nUPDATE:  I'm also realizing that this curate.cfg file needs more updates.  It looks like we no longer need the curate.ui.* settings in this file (they likely can be removed entirely as they are not needed in DSpace/dspace-angular#799).   Additionally, we should update the list of plugin.named.org.dspace.curate.CurationTask to comment out those tasks which are normally NOT enabled by default.  As in DSpace v6.x, there should only be 3 default tasks enabled... profileformats, requiredmetadata, and checklinks.  You could leave noop uncommented, but both vscan and translate should be commented out as they require additional configuration to work correctly.\nUPDATE 2:  I'm also now wondering where this plugin.named.org.dspace.curate.CurationTask setting is being used from the REST API.  After reviewing DSpace/dspace-angular#799, it looks like it is NOT used there.  So, we may be able to simply remove this new rest.properties.exposed line altogether. But, I still think we should comment out the vscan and translate tasks by default, so they are not runnable from REST API until configured.", "url": "https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/2820#discussion_r457720071", "createdAt": "2020-07-20T22:10:07Z", "author": {"login": "tdonohue"}, "path": "dspace/config/modules/curate.cfg", "diffHunk": "@@ -52,3 +52,6 @@ curate.ui.statusmessages = \\\n      2 = Skip, \\\n      other = Invalid Status\n \n+\n+rest.properties.exposed = plugin.named.org.dspace.curate.CurationTask", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "fec04568ffcf761777702144ba47007293b39fb0"}, "originalPosition": 5}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ1OTI3Njk2Nw==", "bodyText": "@tdonohue\n\nEmail parameter in UI\n\nI checked this with Kevin, and he provided me with the information regarding the work about this being fixed for the  metadata-import.

To shield the configuration of the properties, the information that can be retrieved through rest need to be configured as such. I'd advise to keep it, so at least there is an option to retrieve the curation tasks that are enabled.
