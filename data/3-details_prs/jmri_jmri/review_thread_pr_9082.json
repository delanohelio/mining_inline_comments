For long term maintenance and testing reasons, It is advisable to have a different implementation for each of the three types.  That also simplified the logic, because each class has to handle only the information pertaining to the hardware it handles.\nFor an example of where we do this elsewhere, see the Z21 Reporter implementation.", "url": "https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/9082#discussion_r506729389", "createdAt": "2020-10-16T21:29:11Z", "author": {"login": "pabender"}, "path": "java/src/jmri/jmrix/can/cbus/CbusReporter.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -25,40 +24,81 @@\n  * A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
