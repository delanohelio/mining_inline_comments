I think @petecressman was (starting to?) work with some configurations that were big enough that it was starting to matter.  I don't have any more detail than that; the PR doesn't mention this, and my notes on the topic are pretty sparse. @petecressman do you remember this?  Do you have a file(s) that can test if this has a performance impact?
