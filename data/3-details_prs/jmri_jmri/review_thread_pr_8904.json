It's defined as a series of <dt>/<dt> \"terms\" and <dd></dd> \"definitions\".\nIts fine to have multiple definitions for a single term, but then they're considered 'alternative' definitions:  'multiple paragraphs forming part of the same value must all be given within the same dd element.'\nI agree that most browsers don't make any distinction between multiple paragraphs within a value and multiple values.  Safari (my default browser) makes a visual distinction when doing default formatting, but doesn't make one with JMRI's CSS. John Plocher (@plocher)might have set that up intentionally.\nThere are places where it matters, though. We've recently seen one surface: a blind new user has been trying to work with JMRI via a screen reader.  He's uncovered several things in the program itself, most of which are now fixed.  But he's also sensitized me a bit to how we use HTML.  The screen reader is really good at working with standard HTML, but it's also quite literal:  It represents the mark up aspect of HTML quite specifically.\nSo I agree that it's not a reason to hold this PR. I'll merge it momentarily.  But it might be good to add to your every-growing list of things that could be improved in the documentation.\nThanks for your patience with this.", "url": "https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/8904#discussion_r467606009", "createdAt": "2020-08-09T17:01:03Z", "author": {"login": "bobjacobsen"}, "path": "help/en/html/apps/Errors.shtml", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,216 @@\n+<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN\"\n+\"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd\">\n+\n+<html lang=\"en\">\n+<head>\n+  <meta name=\"generator\" content=\n+  \"HTML Tidy for Mac OS X (vers 31 October 2006 - Apple Inc. build 15.17), see www.w3.org\">\n+  <!-- Copyright Bob Jacobsen 2008 - 2016 -->\n+\n+  <title>JMRI Setup - Error Messages and Codes</title>\n+\n+  <!--#include virtual=\"/Style.shtml\" -->\n+\n+</head>\n+\n+<body>\n+  <!--#include virtual=\"/Header.shtml\" -->\n+  <div id=\"mBody\">\n+    <!--#include virtual=\"Sidebar.shtml\" -->\n+    <div id=\"mainContent\">\n+      <!-- Page Body -->\n+\n+      <h1>JMRI Setup: Error Messages and Codes</h1>\n+      <!-- THIS WILL BE THE MASTER COPY: In process of removing copies from help/en/manual/DecoderPro3/Error.shtml and help/en/html/tools/programmer/ \n+      and help/en/html/setup/Errors.shtml   @jerryg2003 08/07/2020 -->\n+\n+      <p>Various things can go wrong when JMRI tries to work with\n+      your DCC command station to program a DCC decoder.
