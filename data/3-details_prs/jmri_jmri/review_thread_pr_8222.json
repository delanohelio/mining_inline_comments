It configures a decoder, capable\n+          of displaying signal aspects on several signal masts. The configuration contains\n+          over 500 of CVs - yet the basic idea behind the configuration is dead simple:\n+     </p>\n+          <ul>\n+            <li>a default aspect for each signal mast</li>\n+            <li>for each signal mast AND for each one of 32 possible aspects, the number of signal to be displayed, \n+                interpreted by the decoder itself</li>\n+          </ul>\n+     <p>\n+          A few statistics:\n+     </p>\n+          <ul>\n+              <li>original decoder's definition: <b>870 kByte</b> 20608 lines.</li>\n+              <li>stylesheet file: <b>12 kByte</b>, 257 lines.</li>\n+              <li>decoder file template: <b>18 kByte</b>, 390 lines.</li>\n+          </ul>\n+     <p>\n+          For JMRI itself or the speed of DecoderPro operation, these two approaches are the same: the file template\n+          is internally transformed (expanded) to the decode definition XML and processed as if it was written\n+          entirely by hand. For <b>maintenance</b>, it is a way easier to maintain ~600 lines of XML than 20600.\n+     </p>\n+     <p>\n+          JMRI provides an option to apply a <b>XSLT stylesheet</b> to a decoder file,\n+          <b>before</b> the file is loaded into DecoderPro and before it is interpreted\n+          as CV variables and panels. This allows to hand-write unique CV definitions\n+          and their panes, and <b>add generated</b> content where appropriate. \n+      </p>\n+      <h2>\n+          Example files\n+      </h2>\n+      <p>\n+          To illustrate the techniques described here, a few example files are provided; all the files are licensed under\n+          GNU GPL.\n+      </p>\n+      <ul>\n+          <li><b><a href=\"resources/decoder-template.xml\">decoder-template.xml</a></b> - the decoder definition <b>template</b> \n+          <li><b><a href=\"resources/scom.xsl\">scom.xsl</a></b> - the stylesheet</li>\n+      </ul>\n+      <p>\n+          The decoder template should be placed into the <b>xml/decoders</b> folder of the JMRI installation.
