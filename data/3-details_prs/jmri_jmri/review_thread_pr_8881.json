I sent this originally as part of a normal email, you may have gotten this already):\nThank you for the suggestion.  But the reason I put this comment line in there is so that I as a programmer can remember where in the huge directory structure the file is located, so that I can edit it.  It is only for \"me\".  At least if the name changes, the directory will probably still be the same.  So at least I have an idea where to look.  I'm not too good at remembering where 1000's of things are.  I'm only a lowly programmer shmuck! :-) :-)\nNow that you understand why the comment is there (for my memory, nothing else), if you still think I should remove it, I will.  I tell you all this because maybe I don't understand your comment (because of my my lack of understanding JMRI in general).\nAnd I really want to hear your opinion as to whether that is a good place for the memory aid for me.  I tend to put those reminders right in the source.  Maybe I shouldn't?  And I'm asking your opinion on that too please, not just this one.\nSincerely\nGreg", "url": "https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/8881#discussion_r463221958", "createdAt": "2020-07-30T19:28:41Z", "author": {"login": "Gregory-J-Bedlek"}, "path": "java/src/jmri/jmrit/ctc/CTCMain.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -1,6 +1,8 @@\n /**\n  *  @author Gregory J.

We are here to help you. Not long ago, I too was new to JMRI development so I know the difficulty with learning where everything is located in the JMRI project. There are still a lot of blind spots of JMRI development that I don't understand.\nMy suggestion is that you have your own document with useful notes, and that you keep that file outside the JMRI project. I have many such documents for things I'm working on.\nDid you sent me an email? If so, to which email address? I haven't got any private email from you so my question is if there is a problem with my email? My email is db123 AT bergqvist.se, replace AT with @ .
