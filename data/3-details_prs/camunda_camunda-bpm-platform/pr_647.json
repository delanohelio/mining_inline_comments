All you need is a MITM!\nUpdate: Want to take over the Java ecosystem? All you need is a MITM!\n\n\nThis is a security fix for a  vulnerability in your Apache Maven pom.xml file(s).\nThe build files indicate that this project is resolving dependencies over HTTP instead of HTTPS.\nThis leaves your build vulnerable to allowing a Man in the Middle (MITM) attackers to execute arbitrary code on your or your computer or CI/CD system.\nThis vulnerability has a CVSS v3.0 Base Score of 8.1/10.\nPOC code has existed since 2014 to maliciously compromise a JAR file in-flight.\nMITM attacks against HTTP are increasingly common, for example Comcast is known to have done it to their own users.\nThis contribution is a part of a submission to the GitHub Security Lab Bug Bounty program.\nDetecting this and Future Vulnerabilities\nThis vulnerability was automatically detected by LGTM.com using this CodeQL Query.\nAs of September 2019 LGTM.com and Semmle are officially a part of GitHub.\nYou can automatically detect future vulnerabilities like this by enabling the free (for open-source) LGTM App.\nI'm not an employee of GitHub nor of Semmle, I'm simply a user of LGTM.com and an open-source security researcher.\nSource\nYes, this contribution was automatically generated, however, the code to generate this PR was lovingly hand crafted to bring this security fix to your repository.\nThe source code that generated and submitted this PR can be found here:\nJLLeitschuh/bulk-security-pr-generator\nOpting-Out\nIf you'd like to opt-out of future automated security vulnerability fixes like this, please consider adding a file called\n.github/GH-ROBOTS.txt to your repository with the line:\nUser-agent: JLLeitschuh/bulk-security-pr-generator\nDisallow: *\n\nThis bot will respect the ROBOTS.txt format for future contributions.\nAlternatively, if this project is no longer actively maintained, consider archiving the repository.\nCLA Requirements\nThis section is only relevant if your project requires contributors to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) for external contributions.\nIt is unlikely that I'll be able to directly sign CLAs.
