Naming-wise however, I am a bit concerned.\nReasoning:\nRight now, we only use an authorization left join when CMMN is enabled. If we ever decide to have a left join here for any other reason, this assumption will not always be true. It is documented here, so people could definitely find it but it is easy to be missed as well.\nAs is said, I am just concerned for future updates. Other than that, it is fine.\nCleanest solution would probably be to introduce another property for that.
