(i think it'd be nice to rename the key also.) in StudyOptionsFragment, the string for menu item action_deck_or_study_options is set dynamically.\nHow Has This Been Tested?\nvisually on my device, also ran gradlew jacocoUnitTestReport\ni did NOT test this on a tablet as i don't have one\nChecklist\nPlease, go through these checks before submitting the PR.\n\n You have not changed whitespace unnecessarily (it makes diffs hard to read)\n You have a descriptive commit message with a short title (first line, max 50 chars).\n Your code follows the style of the project (e.g. never omit braces in if statements)\n You have commented your code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\n You have performed a self-review of your own code\n UI changes: include screenshots of all affected screens (in particular showing any new or changed strings): hopefully didn't miss any https://x0.at/ckl.zip\n Strings resources: All strings added as resources are unique or contain a comment for seemingly duplicate strings to explain the difference between both resources", "createdAt": "2020-11-19T15:37:26Z", "url": "https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/pull/7726", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "87b70fbece234a287265d4e91a6cc8a6322cf3a0"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-12-08T18:27:41Z", "author": {"login": "oakkitten"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 4, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABdkNqG2AFqTU0NzQ2NTA3Nw==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABdkObvmgFqTU0NzUxMDk2Ng==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NTQ3NDY1MDc3", "url": "https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/pull/7726#pullrequestreview-547465077", "createdAt": "2020-12-08T17:30:47Z", "commit": {"oid": "018755f959b43aea46d165eb5254cded3552a0a6"}, "state": "CHANGES_REQUESTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMi0wOFQxNzozMDo0N1rOIBrzDw==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMi0wOFQxNzozMDo0N1rOIBrzDw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUzODYzNzA3MQ==", "bodyText": "This looks suspect - I can only imagine that we added the null check in there in order to stop a crash or similar.
