It seems we are going to use screenshot and not explanations, which is not a bad idea at all. If we don't have explanation for current strings, it's strange to ask for future strings.\nMy point is only that I want to avoid duplicate strings. Sometime duplicate strings are necessary because two translations can be possible. In this case, and in this case only, I really want a comment to explain what is going on. That's going to be useful for translators of course, but also for futur dev.\u00a0Indeed, if a dev' want to reuse the string at some point in time, they'll need to know what ressource to use.
