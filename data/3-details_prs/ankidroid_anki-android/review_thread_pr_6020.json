That's a strong enough argument for something like this, but the performance consideration is important as well of course.\nI do not want test code in the 'main' tree if possible though and I've gone to some lengths to avoid it in my own testing. There is almost always a way to have the \"main\" tree be \"clean\" (but maybe more flexible, so you can inject test settings) without having actual test-related code in here.\nIn this instance, perhaps you could sub-class CollectionHelper as TestCollectionHelper in the \"test\" class hierarchy and override the method, then use the TestCollectionHelper to do the same - this is a common and easy pattern", "url": "https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/pull/6020#discussion_r409134955", "createdAt": "2020-04-15T21:08:34Z", "author": {"login": "mikehardy"}, "path": "AnkiDroid/src/main/java/com/ichi2/anki/CollectionHelper.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -116,6 +119,10 @@ public synchronized Collection getCol(Context context) {\n         return mCollection;\n     }\n \n+    public void setTest() {", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "02bde3959ea01444ed611300da80c41bdda50cf1"}, "originalPosition": 14}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwOTEzNzc1NA==", "bodyText": "Another idea I had would be to allow a string parameter for the folder name.
