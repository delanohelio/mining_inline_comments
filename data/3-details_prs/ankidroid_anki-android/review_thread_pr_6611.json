Otherwise, it's already invalidating and doing a new search. That's the purpose of the call to search after the edit note activity\n\nThat is; I admit that you are generally quite right. If anything was done in card editor, the list should be rebuilt from scratch. And that is exactly what is already occurring. However,\u00a0I would believe that if no change were made in the card editor, then there is no reason to recompute the list. This seems especially important because it's easy to just misclick. Computing a search is expensive for big collection and slow phone, I'd like to avoid misclick to loose seconds.\nIf you disagree and think that even when the card editor state there is no change, we should still recompute, I can do it.
