So you might have a second test structure next to the TEST_DECKS definition that is TEST_DECKS_DUE_TREE, and then you would have some assertions that what you got from calling getCol().getSched().deckDueTree() matches your expected results. There examples of matchers being used in the src/main/test code all over and the API we're using mostly is http://hamcrest.org/JavaHamcrest/ so maybe since I don't see a reflective deep-object-comparator there you would make a few assertions about the shape of the deck due tree when it came back, like how many entries, at what level etc, or you could write a quick 'DeckDueTree' comparator and ask Hamcrest to use it", "url": "https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/pull/6548#discussion_r445126379", "createdAt": "2020-06-24T19:37:54Z", "author": {"login": "mikehardy"}, "path": "AnkiDroid/src/test/java/com/ichi2/libanki/sched/SchedTest.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -124,6 +125,15 @@ private void selectNewDeck() {\n         getCol().getDecks().select(did);\n     }\n \n+    @Test\n+    public void ensureDeckTree() {\n+        for (String deckName: TEST_DECKS) {\n+            addDeck(deckName);\n+        }\n+        getCol().getSched().deckDueTree();", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "a849661b5bc957d2e7c7484dcc15307e20754fb7"}, "originalPosition": 17}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0NTE4NDc4Nw==", "bodyText": "The main problem I have is that I don't know what I can expect to already exists.
