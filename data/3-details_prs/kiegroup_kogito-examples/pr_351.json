[**Pull Request Checker Workflow**](pr-checker-workflow): it will coordinate the changes in the PR \n+opened in a given GitHub repository. Depending on the files changed in the project,\n+different labels and reviewers will be automatically added in the PR. In the end of \n+the workflow, the service will broadcast a \"PR Verified\" event to the cluster.\n+2. [**GitHub API Wrapper Service**](github-service): calling the GitHub API as a GitHub Application\n+requires a token to be generated on a small timeframe. This service generates a valid\n+token each 5 minutes to make calls to the API. Besides token management, it wraps \n+the API and simplifies its interface just for the sake of this example.\n+3.

Please follow those instructions before continuing.\n+\n+**Heads up!** This service will be deployed as a Knative Service instead of a regular Kubernetes\n+Deployment.\n+\n+To make things easier for you, we left a script in this directory to generate the template\n+files, build the application and the image, and then deploy it to your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+You can run the script once and all the required files will be generated for you in \n+the `kubernetes` directory, and the image will be published to your Quay.io account.\n+\n+Fill the value for the variables as shown below and run the script:\n+\n+```shell script\n+# the script accepts positional arguments as following:\n+QUAY_NAMESPACE=\n+SLACK_WEBHOOK=\n+\n+./deploy-kubernetes.sh $QUAY_NAMESPACE $SLACK_WEBHOOK\n+```\n+\n+You should see a similar output like this:\n+\n+```\n+// build logs surpressed\n+---> Building and pushing image using tag quay.io/ricardozanini/notification-service:latest\n+STEP 1: FROM adoptopenjdk:11-jre-hotspot\n+STEP 2: RUN mkdir -p /opt/app/lib\n+--> Using cache 26183c5ad8a51a030030a250db0c99e649fdd9668ef4766d0b66782d0dad7573\n+STEP 3: COPY target/notification-service-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar /opt/app\n+--> 2a5b658411b\n+STEP 4: COPY target/lib/*.jar /opt/app/lib\n+--> 5fedac21977\n+STEP 5: CMD [\"java\", \"-jar\", \"/opt/app/notification-service-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar\"]\n+STEP 6: COMMIT quay.io/ricardozanini/notification-service:latest\n+--> afe502d1940\n+afe502d1940d65f151c051008bb2057344607408c192787a726399d23d90c2d3\n+Getting image source signatures\n+Copying blob bf509d6bc5ec skipped: already exists  \n+Copying blob 2af0e1f1e531 skipped: already exists  \n+Copying blob 4b07a7bca5b7 skipped: already exists  ", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "90fb1e5bcb8c4cfd981199ccabbe06196c9dd487"}, "originalPosition": 96}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwODAzMTkzNw==", "bodyText": "is use provide some other thing than docker?\nwouldn't be better just use:\n\"${BUILDER}\" build --tag \"${image_tag}\" .\n\"${BUILDER}\" push \"${image_tag}\"\n\na error will be thrown anyway if command is wrong or don't exist.", "url": "https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/pull/351#discussion_r508031937", "createdAt": "2020-10-19T20:09:18Z", "author": {"login": "spolti"}, "path": "serverless-workflow-github-showcase/scripts/common.sh", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,52 @@\n+#!/bin/bash\n+# Copyright 2020 Red Hat, Inc. and/or its affiliates\n+#\n+# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n+# you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n+# You may obtain a copy of the License at\n+#\n+#      http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n+#\n+# Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n+# distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n+# WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n+# See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n+# limitations under the License.\n+\n+BUILDER=podman\n+\n+function check_binaries() {\n+  local return_code=0\n+\n+  if !
