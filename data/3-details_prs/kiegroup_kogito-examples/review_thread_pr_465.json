I should remark to checkout stable instead of the target release branch, wdyt?\nI think the \"issue\" here is that we declare what is the version of kogito operator for the demo (for example 0.17), and of course master might contain new features that are not on 0.17. This messes up the demo and by construction it might be \"broken\" on master.\nThe other examples on master are running fine since they are using snapshot and not a specific version of kogito.
