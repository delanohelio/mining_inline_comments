[**Pull Request Checker Workflow**](pr-checker-workflow): it will coordinate the changes in the PR \n+opened in a given GitHub repository. Depending on the files changed in the project,\n+different labels and reviewers will be automatically added in the PR. In the end of \n+the workflow, the service will broadcast a \"PR Verified\" event to the cluster.\n+2. [**GitHub API Wrapper Service**](github-service): calling the GitHub API as a GitHub Application\n+requires a token to be generated on a small timeframe. This service generates a valid\n+token each 5 minutes to make calls to the API. Besides token management, it wraps \n+the API and simplifies its interface just for the sake of this example.\n+3.

[CloudEvents](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec) published by our workflow and post\n+messages in a specific Slack channel using the event data as input.\n+\n+### Creating a new Slack App\n+\n+Like in the GitHub service procedure, we are going to need an API key from a third party\n+service. \n+\n+Go to [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/apps) page and create a new app \n+(or you can reuse one you already have instead).\n+\n+Once you create the app, go to the \"Incoming WebHooks\" menu and copy the \"WebHook URL\". \n+\n+Install the app in one of the Workspaces you have and create a \"github-showcase\" channel\n+there for the service to send some messages. Since it's a demo, you don't want to annoy people with lame \n+bot messages. :)\n+\n+### Trying the service locally\n+\n+Once you have the Slack App created and the WebHook, it's time to try the application locally.\n+\n+This service is just a plain Quarkus application with the [Camel Slack component](https://camel.apache.org/components/latest/slack-component.html) to communicate\n+with the Slack API.\n+\n+Copy the WebHook URL in the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file:\n+\n+```properties\n+# URL details not shown\n+org.kogito.examples.sw.notification.slack.incoming=https://hooks.slack.com/services/(...)\n+```\n+\n+Run the application with:\n+\n+```shell script\n+$ mvn clean quarkus:dev\n+```\n+\n+This service listens to the `/` (root) path for messages in [CloudEvents format](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/spec.md#example), but \n+we added the `/plain` endpoint as well for testing purposes. Sending a request to this\n+endpoint will post a message in the `github-showcase` channel:\n+\n+```shell script\n+curl -X POST \"http://localhost:8080/plain\" -H  \"Content-Type: text/plain\" -d \"this is a test message\"\n+``` \n+\n+As always, we included the Swagger UI in the service, access it at http:localhost:8080/swagger-ui/. \n+\n+### Deploying on Kubernetes\n+\n+> **HEADS UP!** delete the Slack WebHook from the `application.properties` file. \n+> We're going to build an image from the source, you don't want your credentials to be exposed to the world!! \n+\n+> **IMPORTANT! :warning:** we assume you have read the prerequisites section in the main\n+> [README file](../README.md). Please follow those instructions before continuing.\n+\n+**Heads up!** This service will be deployed as a Knative Service instead of a regular Kubernetes\n+Deployment.\n+\n+To make things easier for you, we left a script in this directory to generate the template\n+files, build the application and the image, and then deploy it to your Kubernetes cluster.\n+\n+You can run the script once and all the required files will be generated for you in \n+the `kubernetes` directory, and the image will be published to your Quay.io account.\n+\n+Fill the value for the variables as shown below and run the script:\n+\n+```shell script\n+# the script accepts positional arguments as following:\n+QUAY_NAMESPACE=\n+SLACK_WEBHOOK=\n+\n+./deploy-kubernetes.sh $QUAY_NAMESPACE $SLACK_WEBHOOK\n+```\n+\n+You should see a similar output like this:\n+\n+```\n+// build logs surpressed\n+---> Building and pushing image using tag quay.io/ricardozanini/notification-service:latest\n+STEP 1: FROM adoptopenjdk:11-jre-hotspot\n+STEP 2: RUN mkdir -p /opt/app/lib\n+--> Using cache 26183c5ad8a51a030030a250db0c99e649fdd9668ef4766d0b66782d0dad7573\n+STEP 3: COPY target/notification-service-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar /opt/app\n+--> 2a5b658411b\n+STEP 4: COPY target/lib/*.jar /opt/app/lib\n+--> 5fedac21977\n+STEP 5: CMD [\"java\", \"-jar\", \"/opt/app/notification-service-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar\"]\n+STEP 6: COMMIT quay.io/ricardozanini/notification-service:latest\n+--> afe502d1940\n+afe502d1940d65f151c051008bb2057344607408c192787a726399d23d90c2d3\n+Getting image source signatures\n+Copying blob bf509d6bc5ec skipped: already exists  \n+Copying blob 2af0e1f1e531 skipped: already exists  \n+Copying blob 4b07a7bca5b7 skipped: already exists  ", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "90fb1e5bcb8c4cfd981199ccabbe06196c9dd487"}, "originalPosition": 96}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMzE4MjI3NzE5OnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "serverless-workflow-github-showcase/scripts/common.sh", "isResolved": true, "comments": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMC0xOVQyMDowOToxOFrOHkfzwQ==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMC0yMFQxNDo0NDozNlrOHlAuQA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwODAzMTkzNw==", "bodyText": "is use provide some other thing than docker?\nwouldn't be better just use:\n\"${BUILDER}\" build --tag \"${image_tag}\" .\n\"${BUILDER}\" push \"${image_tag}\"\n\na error will be thrown anyway if command is wrong or don't exist.", "url": "https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/pull/351#discussion_r508031937", "createdAt": "2020-10-19T20:09:18Z", "author": {"login": "spolti"}, "path": "serverless-workflow-github-showcase/scripts/common.sh", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,52 @@\n+#!/bin/bash\n+# Copyright 2020 Red Hat, Inc. and/or its affiliates\n+#\n+# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n+# you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n+# You may obtain a copy of the License at\n+#\n+#      http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n+#\n+# Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n+# distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n+# WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n+# See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n+# limitations under the License.\n+\n+BUILDER=podman\n+\n+function check_binaries() {\n+  local return_code=0\n+\n+  if ! command -v kubectl &>/dev/null; then\n+    echo \"---> kubectl not found, please install it to run this script\"\n+    return_code=1\n+  fi\n+\n+  if ! command -v podman &>/dev/null; then\n+    echo \"---> podman not found, setting default builder to docker\"\n+    BUILDER=docker\n+    if ! command -v docker &>/dev/null; then\n+      echo \"---> docker not found, please install it to run this script\" && return_code=1\n+    fi\n+  fi\n+\n+  return ${return_code}\n+}\n+\n+function build_push_image() {\n+  image_ns=$1\n+  image_name=$2\n+  # defining image tag\n+  image_tag=\"quay.io/${image_ns}/${image_name}:latest\"\n+\n+  echo \"---> Building and pushing image using tag ${image_tag}\"\n+  # build image\n+  if [ \"${BUILDER}\" == \"docker\" ]; then\n+    docker build --tag \"${image_tag}\" .\n+    docker push \"${image_tag}\"\n+  else", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "90fb1e5bcb8c4cfd981199ccabbe06196c9dd487"}, "originalPosition": 48}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwODU3MTIwMA==", "bodyText": "is use provide some other thing than docker?\n\nActually we verify if podman exists, otherwise use docker.
