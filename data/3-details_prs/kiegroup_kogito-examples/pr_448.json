I guess you wanted to enforce that a kid will be assigned to a pediatric regardless of his disease. You're actually obtaining this result but in a quite \"unconventional\" way. What it's happening here (see also the former comment) is that other rules may fire before of this but regardless of it this rule (which has the lowest salience) will eventually fire (for a kid) as the last one overwriting any other assigned doctor. What I'd do to obtain the same result would be giving this rule the highest possible salience (in a business domain related sense this is the most relevant/important rule and it is counter-intuitive that you're giving the lowest salience to it) and adding the condition assignedDoctor == null to other rules. Finally note that implicitly the rules are considered having decreasing salience in a drl file (unless you don't override this behaviour explicitly using the salience attribute as you're doing here)

Patient Onboarding\n+\n+## Description\n+\n+In this example we will see how to use the [Serverless Workflow specification](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification)\n+implementation on Kogito to orchestrate a sequence of REST calls in an Event-Driven architecture.\n+\n+This use case is about onboarding a new patient in a hospital, and based on their symptom, the \n+application will assign to the right expert. \n+\n+The workflow starts with a CloudEvent informing a new patient entry:\n+\n+```json\n+{\n+   \"id\":\"12345\",\n+   \"source\":\"/hospital/entry\",\n+   \"specversion\":\"1.0\",\n+   \"type\":\"new.patient.events\",\n+   \"data\":{\n+      \"name\":\"John\",\n+      \"dateOfBirth\":\"2017-08-15\",\n+      \"symptoms\":[\n+         \"seizures\"\n+      ]\n+   }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+Or you can use CURL and set the CloudEvents parameters in the request headers:\n+\n+```shell script\n+$ curl -X POST \\\n+      -H \"content-type: application/json\"  \\\n+      -H \"ce-specversion: 1.0\"  \\\n+      -H \"ce-source: /hospital/entry\"  \\\n+      -H \"ce-type: new.patients.events\"  \\\n+      -H \"ce-id: 12346\"  \\\n+      -d \"{ \\\"name\\\": \\\"Mick\\\", \\\"dateOfBirth\\\": \\\"1983-08-15\\\", \\\"symptoms\\\":[\\\"seizures\\\"]}\" \\\n+  http://localhost:8080\n+```\n+\n+The [workflow](src/main/resources/onbording.sw.json) will then call a sequence of REST services:\n+\n+1. `StoreNewPatient` will store the patient in the internal database for later processing, generating a new ID for they\n+2. `AssignDoctorToPatient` service will run a set of [rules](https://docs.jboss.org/kogito/release/latest/html_single/#con-drl-rule-units_drl-rules) \n+to determine which doctor this patient should be assigned based on their symptoms or general characteristics (children always go to Pediatrics, for example)\n+3. `SchedulePatientAppointment` will find a schedule for this patient based on the agenda of the doctor assigned\n+\n+After executing the workflow, the appointments' data can be fetched using the `/onboarding/schedule/appointment` endpoint.\n+\n+There's a nice web interface for you to try the example available in the root url (http://localhost:8080 for local environments):\n+\n+![](imgs/web_ui.png)\n+\n+Enter the data into the provided form to see the example in action!
