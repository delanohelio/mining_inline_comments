No need to redeploy or restart your running application.During this workshop we will create a software system for a startup travel agency called Kogito Travel Agency. The first iteration of the system will consist of a set of services that are able to deal with travel requests and the booking of hotels and flights.\n+\n+\n+### Compile and Run using Local Native Image\n+Note that this requires GRAALVM_HOME to point to a valid GraalVM installation\n+\n+```\n+mvn clean package -Pnative\n+```\n+\n+To run the generated native executable, generated in `target/`, execute\n+\n+```\n+./target/kogito-visas-{version}-runner\n+```\n+\n+### Start Kogito Data Index Service\n+\n+It can be downloaded from [Kogito Data Index Service 0.8.0](http://repo2.maven.org/maven2/org/kie/kogito/data-index-service/0.4.0/data-index-service-0.4.0-runner.jar)", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwMjM1NTc4MA=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "c09964a2d4d183c20aff82365f1098b6f642d4cd"}, "originalPosition": 121}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Mzg3MDgwNzUw", "url": "https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/pull/178#pullrequestreview-387080750", "createdAt": "2020-04-03T09:04:15Z", "commit": {"oid": "c09964a2d4d183c20aff82365f1098b6f642d4cd"}, "state": "APPROVED", "comments": {"totalCount": 0, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": null, "endCursor": null, "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": []}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "d7b8e600a748410f16c5787a9cb27c733f9afc51", "author": {"user": {"login": "evacchi", "name": "Edoardo Vacchi"}}, "url": "https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/commit/d7b8e600a748410f16c5787a9cb27c733f9afc51", "committedDate": "2020-04-03T10:20:54Z", "message": "KOGITO-1544: Move directory, update README"}}, {"__typename": "HeadRefForcePushedEvent", "beforeCommit": {"oid": "d7b8e600a748410f16c5787a9cb27c733f9afc51", "author": {"user": {"login": "evacchi", "name": "Edoardo Vacchi"}}, "url": "https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/commit/d7b8e600a748410f16c5787a9cb27c733f9afc51", "committedDate": "2020-04-03T10:20:54Z", "message": "KOGITO-1544: Move directory, update README"}, "afterCommit": {"oid": "fec6ba87152ffa4deac561f2aa72a191bd765239", "author": {"user": {"login": "evacchi", "name": "Edoardo Vacchi"}}, "url": "https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/commit/fec6ba87152ffa4deac561f2aa72a191bd765239", "committedDate": "2020-04-04T09:04:33Z", "message": "KOGITO-1544: Move directory, update README"}}, {"__typename": "HeadRefForcePushedEvent", "beforeCommit": {"oid": "fec6ba87152ffa4deac561f2aa72a191bd765239", "author": {"user": {"login": "evacchi", "name": "Edoardo Vacchi"}}, "url": "https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/commit/fec6ba87152ffa4deac561f2aa72a191bd765239", "committedDate": "2020-04-04T09:04:33Z", "message": "KOGITO-1544: Move directory, update README"}, "afterCommit": {"oid": "374acb12a3dac2278603ef473b2185a1d4791583", "author": {"user": {"login": "evacchi", "name": "Edoardo Vacchi"}}, "url": "https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/commit/374acb12a3dac2278603ef473b2185a1d4791583", "committedDate": "2020-04-04T09:30:25Z", "message": "KOGITO-1544: Add travel agency to reactor, update README"}}, {"__typename": "HeadRefForcePushedEvent", "beforeCommit": {"oid": "374acb12a3dac2278603ef473b2185a1d4791583", "author": {"user": {"login": "evacchi", "name": "Edoardo Vacchi"}}, "url": "https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/commit/374acb12a3dac2278603ef473b2185a1d4791583", "committedDate": "2020-04-04T09:30:25Z", "message": "KOGITO-1544: Add travel agency to reactor, update README"}, "afterCommit": {"oid": "d7b8e600a748410f16c5787a9cb27c733f9afc51", "author": {"user": {"login": "evacchi", "name": "Edoardo Vacchi"}}, "url": "https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/commit/d7b8e600a748410f16c5787a9cb27c733f9afc51", "committedDate": "2020-04-03T10:20:54Z", "message": "KOGITO-1544: Move directory, update README"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Mzg4MDk0MTIz", "url": "https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/pull/178#pullrequestreview-388094123", "createdAt": "2020-04-06T09:50:11Z", "commit": {"oid": "d7b8e600a748410f16c5787a9cb27c733f9afc51"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNC0wNlQwOTo1MDoxMlrOGBQC4g==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNC0wNlQwOTo1MjowM1rOGBQHGA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwMzk2NDY0Mg==", "bodyText": "I guess this no longer holds as we have just one version here.", "url": "https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/pull/178#discussion_r403964642", "createdAt": "2020-04-06T09:50:12Z", "author": {"login": "MarianMacik"}, "path": "kogito-travel-agency/README.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,28 @@\n+# Kogito Travel Agency - tutorial\n+\n+## Description\n+\n+During this workshop we will create a software system for a startup travel agency called Kogito Travel Agency.
