Ultimately with coupling targets we have to be pragmatic, and so they can be violated if required. In this case, the ViewerModule is determining business rules  targetting certain available viewers which are ultimately UI components. As a result, it unfortunately needs to know about what's happening in the view layer.\nThere are a few patterns we could use to abstract that, but I think that's probably adding unnecessary complexity at this point. If in the future we did need to rework this, at least the coupling issue would only be in one place - and is unlikely to spread.
