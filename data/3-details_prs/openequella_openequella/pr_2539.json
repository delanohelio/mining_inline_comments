The New UI side of things all works, however it has unveiled a few bugs with the legacy UI remote searching (primarily excessive persisting of state). Those issues are well outside the scope of this work, however will definitely need to be fixed to release 2020.2 and so will be in a PR soon.\nVideo: https://streamable.com/on6ljx\n\n\n#1306", "createdAt": "2020-11-19T22:49:32Z", "url": "https://github.com/openequella/openEQUELLA/pull/2539", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "b5c08e10717f5cfb9041307d83d5c9594450acbd"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-11-24T02:49:27Z", "author": {"login": "edalex-ian"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 4, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABdeKSAggH2gAyNTI0MjgzNTY1OmVmZjQ0MzU1N2U5MzRjNWQzYzkzNWY4MjMzOTVkYjI0MWQ4MGVkOGU=", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABdfe6d1AFqTUzNjk1NzM4MA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "eff443557e934c5d3c935f823395db241d80ed8e", "author": {"user": {"login": "edalex-ian", "name": null}}, "url": "https://github.com/openequella/openEQUELLA/commit/eff443557e934c5d3c935f823395db241d80ed8e", "committedDate": "2020-11-19T22:13:41Z", "message": "feature(new-ui): Add new Remote Search Selector"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NTM2OTMzNTU0", "url": "https://github.com/openequella/openEQUELLA/pull/2539#pullrequestreview-536933554", "createdAt": "2020-11-23T23:48:46Z", "commit": {"oid": "eff443557e934c5d3c935f823395db241d80ed8e"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0yM1QyMzo0ODo0N1rOH4j5AQ==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0yNFQwMDowNDo1OVrOH4kOyQ==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyOTA3MDMzNw==", "bodyText": "I am not quite sure about the use of memoize.
