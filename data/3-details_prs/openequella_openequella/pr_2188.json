By default, the option of 'yes' is selected. And because there are no Search settings controlling this component's visibility, it's always visible.\nThe structure of this component is almost same as StatusSelector, and so are its tests and stories. So we can create an abstract component called TwoOptionsSelector , but I am not sure how much value we will gain at this stage so I did not implement this.", "createdAt": "2020-08-17T06:54:43Z", "url": "https://github.com/openequella/openEQUELLA/pull/2188", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "50f9df49984647d3447a285f40e86952c82c1a9c"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-08-18T05:44:49Z", "author": {"login": "PenghaiZhang"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 9, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABc_spNqgH2gAyNDY4NjMzNzQ1OjljZTliNzQ3YWM2YTU2MTA1OGNhOGVlNTk3YmRjMTIxNWYzNTVjNDE=", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABc__0jeAFqTQ2ODk5MjcxNw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "9ce9b747ac6a561058ca8ee597bdc1215f355c41", "author": {"user": {"login": "PenghaiZhang", "name": null}}, "url": "https://github.com/openequella/openEQUELLA/commit/9ce9b747ac6a561058ca8ee597bdc1215f355c41", "committedDate": "2020-08-17T06:44:09Z", "message": "Add a new field 'searchAttachments' to OEQ.Search.SearchParams."}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "87d3fc79f9aa2c6fb067ae436d1894e8e7413096", "author": {"user": {"login": "PenghaiZhang", "name": null}}, "url": "https://github.com/openequella/openEQUELLA/commit/87d3fc79f9aa2c6fb067ae436d1894e8e7413096", "committedDate": "2020-08-17T06:44:09Z", "message": "Create a new component as Search attachments Selector.\n\nThis selector provides two options: yes/no.
