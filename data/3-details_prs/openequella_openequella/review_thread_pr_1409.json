The intention with these is that the included\n+  change in any new hotfix is low risk, but addresses key issues being experienced by adopters.\n+\n+Hotfixes include code which has also been included on the latest stable version, and has\n+been deemed safe to 'backport' to older versions.

However\n+there are no claims made to the stability of this branch - it's very much at ones own risk, and\n+meant only for developers.\n+\n+## Processes\n+\n+### Stable Releases\n+\n+Creation of 'stable' releases start when 'feature complete'/'code freeze' has been reached. At this\n+point a `release` branch is created from `develop`. On this branch first the version information is\n+updated, and then the first 'release candidate' is built ready for final testing. If issues are\n+found and deemed requiring fixing prior to release then the subsequent builds of this branch can be\n+for additional 'release candidates'.\n+\n+This continues until agreement is reached that the code on the release branch is ready for final\n+release. At which point version information is again updated (to remove any reference to RC), and\n+the release branch is merged into `master` and tagged. The build from that tag is then the new\n+'stable' release. Lastly, that tag point is merged into `develop` to ensure any last minute fixes\n+etc. also make it back into the next feature release.\n+\n+#### Step by Step\n+\n+Starting from a `develop` which is feature complete, assuming we're aiming for version\n+2020.1.0:\n+\n+1. Create a new branch (from `develop`) - e.g. `git checkout -b release/2020.1.0`\n+2. Update root `build.sbt` ensuring `equellaMajor`, `equellaMinor` and `equellaPatch` correctly\n+   represent the version\n+3. Update root `build.sbt` to set `equellaStream` is `RC` - for release candidate, consider even\n+   using `RC1` so that later you can use `RC2` etc for any rework cycles\n+4. Push to git and await a build from Travis CI (which will publish a build - for now - to an S3\n+   bucket maintained by Edalex but which is publicly accessible and noted in build log)\n+5. Download resultant build, and commence testing (and any rework - do more RCs as needed)\n+6. Once agreed that code is ready for release, update root `build.sbt` so that `equellaStream` is\n+   `Stable` and commit\n+7. Now merge `release/2020.1.0` into `master` and push\n+8. Await build and then do a final validation of the resultant artefacts, if all in order tag the\n+   merge commit on master as `2020.1.0` - ensure to push the tag to git with `git push origin 2020.1.0`\n+9. Now go to GitHub to publish/create the new release utilising the pushed tag\n+10. Merge that tag point into develop (e.g. `git checkout develop && git pull && git merge 2020.1.0`) resolving any conflicts that may arise\n+11. Last step, update root `build.sbt` on `develop` to reflect the next planned feature release and\n+    setting `equellaStream` to `Alpha`\n+\n+**Publishing release candidate builds:** It is possible to publish the individual RC builds on\n+GitHub too, just tag each point on the `release/` branch - e.g. with a tag of `2020.1.0-RC1`.\n+\n+At this point a new stable release has been successfully released. However this means that the\n+immediately prior stable version needs to be made ready for any future possible hotfixes.
