On GML output this issue is not present and numeric typed attributes are encoded without exceptions.\nThis was reproduced using a app-schema jdbc multi value element with an integer typed attribute and executing a WFS GetFeature requesting GeoJSON output.\nhttps://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/data/app-schema/mapping-file.html#attributes-with-cardinality-1-n\nThis PR adds a fix for this issue.\nJIRA issue:\nhttps://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOS-9493\nChecklist\n\nReviewing is a process done by project maintainers, mostly on a volunteer basis.
