If multiple focuses cannot be avoided, each one is in its own commit and has a separate ticket describing it.\n New unit tests have been added covering the changes\n This PR passes all existing unit tests (test results will be reported by travis-ci after opening this PR)\n This PR passes the QA checks (QA checks results will be reported by travis-ci after opening this PR)\n Commits changing the UI, existing user workflows, or adding new functionality, need to include documentation updates (screenshots, text)\n Committs changing the REST API, or any configuration object, should check it the REST API docs (Swagger YAML files and classic documentation) need to be updated.\n\nSubmitting the PR does not require you to check all items, but by the time it gets merged, they should be either satisfied or inapplicable.", "createdAt": "2020-03-25T09:20:42Z", "url": "https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/pull/4143", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "2b5566ac1cbd3bd4e77e1e6cc82248655f9e7ede"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-04-06T10:57:00Z", "author": {"login": "taba90"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABcRD9PWAH2gAyMzkzNDczMzI5OmVjZjFiOWM5N2FjOGQ3MGNmOWU1M2QwYTNlNDVkNzBhOWNjYjMxNTA=", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABcS9wRLgFqTM4MzczMDI5MA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "ecf1b9c97ac8d70cf9e53d0a3e45d70a9ccb3150", "author": {"user": {"login": "taba90", "name": null}}, "url": "https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/commit/ecf1b9c97ac8d70cf9e53d0a3e45d70a9ccb3150", "committedDate": "2020-03-25T09:19:24Z", "message": "[GEOS-9550] Notification community plugin tests fails"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3MzgzNzMwMjkw", "url": "https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/pull/4143#pullrequestreview-383730290", "createdAt": "2020-03-30T10:39:26Z", "commit": {"oid": "ecf1b9c97ac8d70cf9e53d0a3e45d70a9ccb3150"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMy0zMFQxMDozOToyN1rOF9js3Q==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMy0zMFQxMDozOToyN1rOF9js3Q==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwMDA5MjM4MQ==", "bodyText": "GeoServer core depends on Guava 27:\n    <dependency>\n      <groupId>com.google.guava</groupId>\n      <artifactId>guava</artifactId>\n      <version>27.0-jre</version>\n    </dependency>\n\nThis might fix the test failures but... would it work at runtime, when the guava 27.0-jre is deployed?\n@afabiani ?", "url": "https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/pull/4143#discussion_r400092381", "createdAt": "2020-03-30T10:39:27Z", "author": {"login": "aaime"}, "path": "src/community/notification/pom.xml", "diffHunk": "@@ -45,6 +45,12 @@\n \t\t\t<version>6.0.3</version>\n \t\t\t<scope>test</scope>\n \t\t</dependency>\n+\t\t<dependency>", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "ecf1b9c97ac8d70cf9e53d0a3e45d70a9ccb3150"}, "originalPosition": 4}]}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 1466, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-01T14:20:25Z"}}}
