After more digging into this, it came down to be a Guice AOP issue.\nCurrently, we override the methods in resource classes from the interface. So few of the annotation in the resource class method is @Override. And other HTTP Annotations are in API interface methods. So in TestingModules, we bind authorization interceptor, we use HttpMethodMatcher. But It does not find the superclass HTTP annotations and fails to invoke the authorization filter for each method.\nTo overcome this particular scenario, I have added a code to explicitly add interceptor for OwnerResource :\n bindInterceptor(Matchers.subclassesOf(OwnerResource.class), Matchers.any(), authMethodInterceptor);\nThis will simply work for any method present in OwnerResource.

This import data is *not*\n+        undone, we assume that updates to this data can be safely kept.\n+      tags:\n+        - Owner Import\n+      operationId: undoImports\n+      parameters:\n+        - name: owner_key\n+          in: path\n+          description: The key of the owner\n+          required: true\n+          schema:\n+            type: string\n+      security: [ ]\n+      responses:\n+        200:\n+          description: Imports for an Owner successfully removed\n+          content:\n+            application/json:\n+              schema:\n+                $ref: '#/components/schemas/AsyncJobStatusDTO'\n+        404:\n+          description: An import owner could not be found using the provided key\n+          content:\n+            application/json:\n+              schema:\n+                $ref: '#/components/schemas/ExceptionMessage'\n+              example:\n+                displayMessage: An import owner could not be found using the provided key\n+                requestUuid: c4347004-8792-41fe-a4d8-fccaa0d3898a\n+        default:\n+          $ref: '#/components/responses/default'\n+\n+  /owners/{owner_key}/imports/async:\n+    post:\n+      description: |\n+        Initiates an asynchronous manifest import for the given organization.\n+        This will bring in any products, content, and subscriptions that were\n+        assigned to the distributor who generated the manifest.\n+      tags:\n+        - Owner Import\n+        - Async\n+      operationId: importManifestAsync\n+      security: []\n+      requestBody:\n+        description: A manifest file to be imported\n+        required: true\n+        content:\n+          multipart/form-data:\n+            schema:\n+              properties:\n+                input:\n+                  type: string\n+                  format: binary\n+      parameters:\n+        - name: owner_key\n+          in: path\n+          description: The key of the owner\n+          required: true\n+          schema:\n+            type: string\n+        - name: force\n+          in: query\n+          description: This is used to override the conflicts\n+          schema:\n+            type: array\n+            items:\n+              type: string\n+      responses:\n+        200:\n+          description: Manifest successfully imported\n+          content:\n+            application/json:\n+              schema:\n+                $ref: '#/components/schemas/AsyncJobStatusDTO'\n+        400:\n+          description: Owner key is null or empty\n+          content:\n+            application/json:\n+              schema:\n+                $ref: '#/components/schemas/ExceptionMessage'\n+              example:\n+                displayMessage: Owner key is null or empty\n+                requestUuid: c4347004-8792-41fe-a4d8-fccaa0d3898a\n+        404:\n+          description: An import owner could not be found using the provided key\n+          content:\n+            application/json:\n+              schema:\n+                $ref: '#/components/schemas/ExceptionMessage'\n+              example:\n+                displayMessage: An import owner could not be found using the provided key\n+                requestUuid: c4347004-8792-41fe-a4d8-fccaa0d3898a\n+        500:\n+          description: |\n+            Internal server error.

This import data is *not*\n+        undone, we assume that updates to this data can be safely kept.\n+      tags:\n+        - Owner Import\n+      operationId: undoImports\n+      parameters:\n+        - name: owner_key\n+          in: path\n+          description: The key of the owner\n+          required: true\n+          schema:\n+            type: string\n+      security: [ ]\n+      responses:\n+        200:\n+          description: Imports for an Owner successfully removed\n+          content:\n+            application/json:\n+              schema:\n+                $ref: '#/components/schemas/AsyncJobStatusDTO'\n+        404:\n+          description: An import owner could not be found using the provided key\n+          content:\n+            application/json:\n+              schema:\n+                $ref: '#/components/schemas/ExceptionMessage'\n+              example:\n+                displayMessage: An import owner could not be found using the provided key\n+                requestUuid: c4347004-8792-41fe-a4d8-fccaa0d3898a\n+        default:\n+          $ref: '#/components/responses/default'\n+\n+  /owners/{owner_key}/imports/async:\n+    post:\n+      description: |\n+        Initiates an asynchronous manifest import for the given organization.\n+        This will bring in any products, content, and subscriptions that were\n+        assigned to the distributor who generated the manifest.\n+      tags:\n+        - Owner Import\n+        - Async\n+      operationId: importManifestAsync\n+      security: []\n+      requestBody:\n+        description: A manifest file to be imported\n+        required: true\n+        content:\n+          multipart/form-data:\n+            schema:\n+              properties:\n+                input:\n+                  type: string\n+                  format: binary\n+      parameters:\n+        - name: owner_key\n+          in: path\n+          description: The key of the owner\n+          required: true\n+          schema:\n+            type: string\n+        - name: force\n+          in: query\n+          description: This is used to override the conflicts\n+          schema:\n+            type: array\n+            items:\n+              type: string\n+      responses:\n+        200:\n+          description: Manifest successfully imported\n+          content:\n+            application/json:\n+              schema:\n+                $ref: '#/components/schemas/AsyncJobStatusDTO'\n+        400:\n+          description: Owner key is null or empty\n+          content:\n+            application/json:\n+              schema:\n+                $ref: '#/components/schemas/ExceptionMessage'\n+              example:\n+                displayMessage: Owner key is null or empty\n+                requestUuid: c4347004-8792-41fe-a4d8-fccaa0d3898a\n+        404:\n+          description: An import owner could not be found using the provided key\n+          content:\n+            application/json:\n+              schema:\n+                $ref: '#/components/schemas/ExceptionMessage'\n+              example:\n+                displayMessage: An import owner could not be found using the provided key\n+                requestUuid: c4347004-8792-41fe-a4d8-fccaa0d3898a\n+        500:\n+          description: |\n+            Internal server error.

Imports do carry rules and product\n+        information which is global to the candlepin server. This import data is *not*\n+        undone, we assume that updates to this data can be safely kept.\n+      tags:\n+        - Owner Import\n+      operationId: undoImports\n+      parameters:\n+        - name: owner_key\n+          in: path\n+          description: The key of the owner\n+          required: true\n+          schema:\n+            type: string\n+      security: [ ]\n+      responses:\n+        200:\n+          description: Imports for an Owner successfully removed\n+          content:\n+            application/json:\n+              schema:\n+                $ref: '#/components/schemas/AsyncJobStatusDTO'\n+        404:\n+          description: An import owner could not be found using the provided key\n+          content:\n+            application/json:\n+              schema:\n+                $ref: '#/components/schemas/ExceptionMessage'\n+              example:\n+                displayMessage: An import owner could not be found using the provided key\n+                requestUuid: c4347004-8792-41fe-a4d8-fccaa0d3898a\n+        default:\n+          $ref: '#/components/responses/default'\n+\n+  /owners/{owner_key}/imports/async:\n+    post:\n+      description: |\n+        Initiates an asynchronous manifest import for the given organization.\n+        This will bring in any products, content, and subscriptions that were\n+        assigned to the distributor who generated the manifest.\n+      tags:\n+        - Owner Import\n+        - Async\n+      operationId: importManifestAsync\n+      security: []\n+      requestBody:\n+        description: A manifest file to be imported\n+        required: true\n+        content:\n+          multipart/form-data:\n+            schema:\n+              properties:\n+                input:\n+                  type: string\n+                  format: binary\n+      parameters:\n+        - name: owner_key\n+          in: path\n+          description: The key of the owner\n+          required: true\n+          schema:\n+            type: string\n+        - name: force\n+          in: query\n+          description: This is used to override the conflicts\n+          schema:\n+            type: array\n+            items:\n+              type: string\n+      responses:\n+        200:\n+          description: Manifest successfully imported\n+          content:\n+            application/json:\n+              schema:\n+                $ref: '#/components/schemas/AsyncJobStatusDTO'\n+        400:\n+          description: Owner key is null or empty\n+          content:\n+            application/json:\n+              schema:\n+                $ref: '#/components/schemas/ExceptionMessage'\n+              example:\n+                displayMessage: Owner key is null or empty\n+                requestUuid: c4347004-8792-41fe-a4d8-fccaa0d3898a\n+        404:\n+          description: An import owner could not be found using the provided key\n+          content:\n+            application/json:\n+              schema:\n+                $ref: '#/components/schemas/ExceptionMessage'\n+              example:\n+                displayMessage: An import owner could not be found using the provided key\n+                requestUuid: c4347004-8792-41fe-a4d8-fccaa0d3898a\n+        500:\n+          description: |\n+            Internal server error.
