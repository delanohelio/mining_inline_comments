That drives how we store data and how we work with data at the logic level. The DTOs and various DTO-like things (adapter *Info interfaces) are views into that model or data. We try to keep them as a subset of the data layer, but that isn't always possible due to preexisting conditions, usages, or just some legacy behavior we cannot remove or update for some reason. In any event, the data model is what drives most of the design of everything around it, not the views.\nIn the case of the adapter interfaces, they are a stopgap implementation to get adapter consumers (IT) to stop using our internal model objects and start using their own, for both maintenance and performance reasons. However, as soon as the adapter's model changed, we had to address the fallout of how the adapters were designed and intended to be used vs how they ended up actually being used; coupled with the fact we now had code that was reliant on multiple versions of the model (data, manifest view and adapter view). So, we were left with a few options, one of which was rewrite every bit of code that surrounded the adapters (i.e. most of the manifest processing, chunks of refresh, etc.), which, as I'm sure you can imagine, was deemed unviable given the sheer volume of such work. After several discussions we landed on the interface + existing DTO reuse we have today. @kahowell might remember and have more to add here if he cares enough.\nNow, should the adapters have their own DTO implementations that we use? Maybe. Given how we seem to want to use the adapters, probably not, though. However, both answers to this question come with plenty of baggage and need to be properly understood before a decision is made. Perhaps the DTO layers should all be interfaces and we can implement them in whatever means we choose?\nSo then... getting back to the original question of why do we need the JsonIgnore annotation. Short answer is: we don't. Having extra fields is a waste of data and processing time, but it's not strictly required that we avoid it if the change is a net addition that doesn't violate any security concerns. In this specific case, I'd be curious to understand why we don't want the product model\nWe have other potential concerns here, such as the one @nikosmoum is seemingly alluding to here and one I brought up in the design discussion yesterday in that we should be avoiding having a view dictate the model implementation. That kind of applies here, but perhaps should be better framed as we should be working to separate the shared implementation of the two interfaces if the overlap is no longer maintainable.", "url": "https://github.com/candlepin/candlepin/pull/2569#discussion_r368022886", "createdAt": "2020-01-17T16:26:10Z", "author": {"login": "Ceiu"}, "path": "server/src/main/java/org/candlepin/dto/manifest/v1/ProductDTO.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -846,6 +847,92 @@ private boolean isNullOrIncomplete(BrandingDTO branding) {\n             branding.getType() == null || branding.getType().isEmpty();\n     }\n \n+    /**\n+     * Retrieves a view of the provided products for the product represented by this DTO.\n+     * If the provided products have not yet been defined, this method returns null.\n+     *\n+     * Note that the collection returned by this method is a view of the collection backing this\n+     * set of provided products.
