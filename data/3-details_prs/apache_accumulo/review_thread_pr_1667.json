If you build / test under maven, the property file will still be there.  So, any testing that uses classes / files under ..../target/...  should still work.\nYou are correct though, if you tried to run it tests using just the jars - unless you provided a metrics configuration file with metrics output configured, then the tests that check those files would fail. If you go to the trouble to run the tests outside of maven using a command line, then if you got that far, adding a suitable config file may not be much of a hurdle and forces you to provide a configuration that you want for your needs.\nOne issue is that the metrics config file is specifying ./target/name as a know location for the output files - this was so that mvn clean would remove them and they would not be left hanging around.\nI suppose that if there was another well know location that would always be suitable for writes, then that could be used instead.  Sounds like just specified /tmp, but that's making an assumption that /tmp would always be suitable - for example would docker / containers / aws / ... prefer not to use /tmp but something else?  And then there's the clean-up - would need something besides (or modification) mvn clean.

Usually, the maven-assembly-plugin is also configured to run during the package phase, but only if a user manually configured it, since it's not bound to the default lifecycle by default.\nIf our tests pass, I have no problem excluding it from the jar. Like you said, our metrics file is set for target directory, specifically, so it's clear it's only for our tests anyway. And, if our test code were reused, it wouldn't be hard for the caller to provide its own metrics config file.\nI would avoid /tmp. It's best to use the target/ directory, and write to no other directories in a Maven build.\nMy final point of feedback, then, is just a suggestion to use the path explicitly, rather than wildcards:\n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n\n  \n  This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.
