I wonder if that distinction (the \"client\" one) was important when this was mushed together with passive socket creation methods and maybe now is less important?\nOh from looking at ServerSocketCreator I think I understand now. Yeah, it has it's own \"connect\" methods. These method signatures seem to be mixing two different concerns and overloading the terms \"client\" and \"server\" to apply to both. I find that confusing\u2026\nUsually when I hear somebody talking about a \"server\" socket I think they are referring to a passive socket (one that is bound to a well-known port). And when I hear them talk about \"client\" sockets I think they are referring to sockets created via (active) connect calls.\nBut our new interfaces are not segregating two kinds of \"sockets\". They're segregating methods for use by clients from methods for use by servers. If I have that right you don't use ServerSocketCreator to create \"server sockets\", rather, servers use it to create all their sockets (actively, passively). And so on for ClientSocketCreator.\nIf this is correct, and obvious to everybody, then just carry on. If it's wrong or not obvious it might be worth some clarification in the class-level comments.", "url": "https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/4743#discussion_r385933746", "createdAt": "2020-02-28T21:36:51Z", "author": {"login": "Bill"}, "path": "geode-tcp-server/src/main/java/org/apache/geode/distributed/internal/tcpserver/ClientSocketCreator.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,44 @@\n+/*\n+ * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more contributor license\n+ * agreements.
