The\nIterator method is stated as being the only safe way to modify the\ncollection while iterating over its contents.\nI've also modified a test to validate the fix.  The test forces a\nfailure to send two messages to an address.  The failures are then\nhandled in the code that was throwing the\nConcurrentModificationException and, since there are two failures,\nit causes two removals to be performedon the failedMessages collection.\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\nFor all changes:\n\n\n Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced in the commit message?\n\n\n Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically develop)?\n\n\n Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit?\n\n\n Does gradlew build run cleanly?\n\n\n Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\n\n\n If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under ASF 2.0?\n\n\nNote:\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, check Concourse for build issues and\nsubmit an update to your PR as soon as possible.
