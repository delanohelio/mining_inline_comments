This resulted in exceptions being raised when individual nodes were not responding and node discovery was not used. This was e.g. being noticable when performing searches and 1 of 3 nodes was failing, so every 3rd search request was timing out and returning an error instead of being retried and successful and just taking longer.\nThis change is adding this class to the exceptions being retried, so any request that goes out to a node which is not responding on time is retried.\nHow Has This Been Tested?\n\n\n\nScreenshots (if appropriate):\nTypes of changes\n\n\n Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\n New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\n Refactoring (non-breaking change)\n Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\n\nChecklist:\n\n\n\n My code follows the code style of this project.\n My change requires a change to the documentation.\n I have updated the documentation accordingly.\n I have read the CONTRIBUTING document.\n I have added tests to cover my changes.", "createdAt": "2020-12-29T12:48:49Z", "url": "https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog2-server/pull/9852", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "102cd1085297a590435873c42d7cbc8c1296ef38"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2021-01-21T17:04:30Z", "author": {"login": "dennisoelkers"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 4, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABdq6KuoAH2gAyNTQ2NDcyMTkxOmJmYmQyZGU1ZWQwZTUxOWJiYWM1NzUxNDFjNWFmYWFlODQ0NmMwZDE=", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABdyXnajgFqTU3MzU0NTEzNw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "bfbd2de5ed0e519bbac575141c5afaae8446c0d1", "author": {"user": {"login": "dennisoelkers", "name": "Dennis Oelkers"}}, "url": "https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog2-server/commit/bfbd2de5ed0e519bbac575141c5afaae8446c0d1", "committedDate": "2020-12-29T12:48:16Z", "message": "Retry read timeouts for Elasticsearch.\n\nBefore this change, the retry strategy used for ES requests did not\nretry for instances of `SocketTimeoutException`, raised in case of read\ntimeouts.
