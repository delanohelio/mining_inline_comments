Identifiable data (if collected) is stored separately from study and response data to help organizations minimize access to that data.\n+\n+The FDA MyStudies platform has been designed to support auditing requirements for compliance with 21 CFR Part 11, allowing the platform to be used for trials under Investigational New Drug (IND) oversight. If an organization chooses to run FDA MyStudies on Google Cloud, a variety of infrastructure options are available that support HIPAA and other compliance requirements. More information about compliance on Google Cloud and an up-to-date list of products covered under BAA can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance/hipaa/).\n+\n+In addition to the platform, the [tools for deployment](Terraform/README.md) on GCP are designed to assist organizations in their end-to-end compliance journey. Although achieving compliance is the responsibility of the customer, these toolkits enable organizations to deploy FDA MyStudies in a way that will help meet compliance requirements; such as setting up audit logs for retaining data. \n+\n+Google Cloud can support customer compliance with 21 CFR Part 11 regulations when using GCP services in a prescribed manner to handle related data and workloads. While Google has a cloud technology stack ready for many 21 CFR Part 11 compliant workloads, the ultimate compliance determination depends on configuration choices made by the customer.\n+\n+## What\u2019s changed?\n+\n+While the overall goals, compliance principles and functionality are unchanged, this release introduces several changes from previous versions of FDA MyStudies:\n+\n+*   Architecture\n+    *   Migrated from a VM architecture to a modular container-based architecture\n+    *   Refactored Participant Datastore\n+    *   Migrated to permissive open-source dependencies\n+    *   Removed dependencies that require commercial licenses\n+    *   Simplified mobile app calls and moved some functionality server-side\n+    *   Improved alignment of responsibilities between components\n+    *   Adjusted data storage based on usage and security requirements (e.g. study and participant status storage and calls were moved to Response Datastore, enrollment generation logic was moved to Participant Datastore)\n+    \n+*   Security\n+    *   Improved the existing authentication in place (e.g. removed application secret from being transmitted in all calls, unified the process into a single auth server)\n+    *   Added HTTPs across codebase\n+    *   Fixed potential cross site scripting vulnerabilities", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "e580c0333273ac491d0c75c1cbd942a37fbc6829"}, "originalPosition": 195}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "973f76d4b8b61f2daa46bdf39b3cd52e76d90964", "author": {"user": {"login": "jkrogers18", "name": null}}, "url": "https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/fda-mystudies/commit/973f76d4b8b61f2daa46bdf39b3cd52e76d90964", "committedDate": "2020-04-28T18:18:28Z", "message": "Update README.md"}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 1170, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-01T14:20:25Z"}}}
