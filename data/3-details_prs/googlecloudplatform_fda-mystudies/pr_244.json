The bundle ID/app token is unique to a client. The client is responsible for storing the bundle ID and app token, and using them for the web service calls. \n+\n+The client follows basic HTTP authentication, where the request to the Study Datastore contains a header field in the form of _Authorization: Basic \\<credentials\\>_ where credentials is the bundle ID and app token are joined by a colon and converted to a Base64 encoded string. \n+\n+The Study Builder web services application validates the credentials on every call.\n+\n+\n+<table>\n+  <tr>\n+   <td>Header Param\n+   </td>\n+   <td>Value\n+   </td>\n+  </tr>\n+  <tr>\n+   <td>Authorization\n+   </td>\n+   <td>Basic &ltBase64 encode value (bundleid:apptoken)&gt\n+   </td>\n+  </tr>\n+</table>\n+\n+\n+The bundle ID and app token are created before deployment and stored in both the Study Datastore and the client application. \n+\n+If the bundle ID and/or app token are changed, it will require a redeployment of the Study Datastore and the client application.\n+\n+\n+## Auth Server Authentication and Authorization\n+\n+The Auth Server provides centralized authentication and authorization for the following platform components:\n+\n+\n+\n+1.  Mobile Apps\n+1.  Participant Datastore\n+1.  Response Datastore\n+1.  Participant Manager (targeted for future release)\n+\n+\n+## Mobile App User Authentication and Authorization\n+\n+The mobile app user credentials are a combination of email address and password. In addition, a mobile app user is associated with an app ID and organization ID. \n+\n+The app ID and organization ID represent the mobile apps managed by an organization. Each mobile app will have a unique app ID. This app ID is generated by the Study Builder user, who creates an app ID with which studies are associated.\n+\n+_Note: Organization ID is a placeholder for future enhancements and not used for validation_\n+\n+\n+### Mobile App User Login\n+\n+![auth_mobile_login.png](images/auth_mobile_login.png \"Mobile login diagram\")\n+\n+\n+Mobile app users are authenticated through the login method of the Auth Server web service. The login flow is as follows:\n+\n+\n+\n+1.  The mobile app is assigned a client ID and secret before deployment, which is managed by the Auth Server. The client ID and secret are stored in the Auth Server database.\n+1.  The login call to the Auth Server requires the mobile app to pass the client ID, secret, app ID, org ID and the user credentials.\n+1.  The Auth Server validates the client ID and secret, and generates a client token for the validated client credentials.\n+1.  The Auth Server checks the login\\_attempts table for the user email and app ID combination, before validating user credentials. It blocks login from the same email ID and app ID if the number of allowed attempts have been exceeded.\n+1.  If the client credentials are valid, it validates the user credentials \u2013 email, password and the app ID with which the user is associated.\n+1.  If the user credentials are valid and the user is associated with the right app ID, then the user is authenticated and authorized for that app.\n+1.  The server generates an access token, refresh token and client token, along with expiry time, for the access token.\n+1.  The tokens are returned to the mobile application.\n+1.  The mobile app is responsible for storing and managing the tokens for subsequent calls.\n+1.  The Auth Server updates the login attempts table for failed logins, with the user email and app ID information.\n+\n+\n+### Password Handling and Rules\n+\n+\n+\n+1.  Passwords are stored and encrypted in a [non-reversible format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt), using a secure [cryptographic one-way hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) (SHA-512) of a [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)) and the password.\n+1.  A random salt is generated for each password, using Cryptographic Pseudo-Random Number Generator (CPRNG)\n+1.  The salt is stored in the database\n+1.  [Password policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_policy) is enforced before saving in the database\n+1.

It outlines the various platform components and their roles, interdependencies and interactions\n+\n+\n+## Architecture Diagram\n+\n+\n+![alt_text](images/architecture.png \"Architecture diagram\")\n+\n+\n+\n+## Terminology\n+\n+Some of the terms used in the document and to what they refer:\n+\n+\n+\n+1.  Participant - A mobile app user is referred to as a participant when he/she enrolls into a study and is associated with a unique participant id. A single mobile app user can be associated with multiple studies and is a unique participant in each study\n+1.  Study Content \u2013 All the content that is required to carry out a study (e.g. study eligibility criteria, consent forms, questionnaires, response types, etc.)\n+1.  Response Data \u2013 Responses provided by a participant to questionnaires and activities set up as the part of a study\n+\n+\n+## Architecture Components\n+\n+The platform components are as follows:\n+\n+\n+\n+1.  Study Builder (UI)\n+1.  Study Datastore\n+1.  Auth Server\n+1.  Participant Manager (UI, targeted for future release)\n+1.  Participant Datastore\n+1.  Response Datastore\n+1.  Mobile Apps (UI, not a server component)\n+\n+\n+### Study Builder\n+\n+The Study Builder provides a user interface for study administrators to create and launch studies and to manage study content during the course of a study.\n+\n+The Study Builder does not handle any patient/participant information. It only deals with content for studies.\n+\n+The Study Builder is the source of study information for all downstream applications. This information is provided through the Study Datastore, described in the section below.\n+\n+The Study Builder is a Java application built on the Spring framework. The backend database is a MySQL database, which is shared with the Study Datastore. The application has a built-in authentication and authorization functionality.\n+\n+The Study Builder can be deployed as a Java web application on servers that have Java, Tomcat and MySQL installed. \n+\n+When deploying the application on GCP, the cloud resources that can be used are:\n+\n+\n+\n+1.  Google Kubernetes Engine\n+1.  Cloud SQL (MySQL)\n+\n+\n+### Study Datastore\n+\n+The Study Datastore provides REST APIs for downstream client applications to obtain all content related to studies set up using the Study Builder.\n+\n+It uses basic authentication with API username and password keys provided to client applications. \n+\n+The Study Datastore does not handle or expose any user/participant information. It provides study content only.\n+\n+It is a Java application built on the Spring framework. The backend database is a MySQL database (the same database used by the Study Builder, which is used to configure the data that is exposed through the Study Datastore APIs).\n+\n+It can be deployed on servers that have Java, Tomcat and MySQL installed.
