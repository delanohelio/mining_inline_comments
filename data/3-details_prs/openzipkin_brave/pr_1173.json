While this is interesting, it is difficult to execute in\n+practice. Instrumentation are usually at a lower level than the application\n+code that they run. Hierarchy is already chosen before it would know if data\n+would be read or not. In most cases, it would be unknowable if data were read\n+or used at that level of abstraction. In other words, such a relationship is\n+more fitting for span tags at a higher level, and decoupled from span\n+hierarchy.\n+\n+Even throwing out the data dependency argument, some may think why not model\n+callback depth anyway? We should model spans how the code looks, right?\n+\n+Only three calls may not seem that bad. Perhaps it is easy to reason with\n+what's going on. However, what if there were 100 or 1000? It would be very\n+difficult to reason with the actual parent which may be 999 levels up the tree.\n+Some backend code perform operations like counting children, in order to\n+determine fan out counts. This code would become useless as there would only\n+ever be one child! Put visually, imagine clicking '-' 999 times to find the\n+real parent in a typical trace UI!\n+\n+We acknowledge that using the invocation context as the parent of follow-up\n+requests (response callback) is imperfect. It means any data dependency between\n+one response and the next request is not represented in the hierarchy. It also\n+means callback depth with not manifest in the trace hierarchy. That said,\n+follow-up requests still share not just the same trace, but also the same local\n+root, and also direct parent. As the clocks are the same (and in fact locked\n+against skew), the happens after relationship manifests in span timing. At any\n+rate, if a data dependency is important, you can consider mapping it as a tag.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "488aabc331d2dd2c5760e139801ebde78aa03555"}, "originalPosition": 90}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDAwNDU0NTgy", "url": "https://github.com/openzipkin/brave/pull/1173#pullrequestreview-400454582", "createdAt": "2020-04-26T03:43:37Z", "commit": {"oid": "488aabc331d2dd2c5760e139801ebde78aa03555"}, "state": "APPROVED", "comments": {"totalCount": 0, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": null, "endCursor": null, "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": []}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 1689, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-01T15:33:45Z"}}}
