Also, for the\n+   * WeakKey instances to function correctly, we are voluntarily breaking the Java API contract for\n+   * hashCode/equals of these instances.\n+   *\n+   *\n+   * System hash codes are immutable and can therefore be computed prematurely and are stored explicitly\n+   * within the WeakKey instances. This way, we always know the correct hash code of a key and always\n+   * end up in the correct bucket of our target map. This remains true even after the weakly referenced\n+   * key is collected.\n+   *\n+   * If we are looking up the value of the current key via WeakConcurrentMap::get or any other public\n+   * API method, we know that any value associated with this key must still be in the map as the mere\n+   * existence of this key makes it ineligible for garbage collection. Therefore, looking up a value\n+   * using another WeakKey wrapper guarantees a correct result.\n+   *\n+   * If we are looking up the map entry of a WeakKey after polling it from the reference queue, we know\n+   * that the actual key was already collected and calling WeakKey::get returns null for both the polled\n+   * instance and the instance within the map. Since we explicitly stored the identity hash code for the\n+   * referenced value, it is however trivial to identify the correct bucket. From this bucket, the first\n+   * weak key with a null reference is removed. Due to hash collision, we do not know if this entry\n+   * represents the weak key. However, we do know that the reference queue polls at least as many weak\n+   * keys as there are stale map entries within the target map. If no key is ever removed from the map\n+   * explicitly, the reference queue eventually polls exactly as many weak keys as there are stale entries.\n+   *\n+   * Therefore, we can guarantee that there is no memory leak.\n+   */\n+  static final class WeakKey<T> extends WeakReference<T> {\n+    final int hashCode;\n+\n+    WeakKey(T key, ReferenceQueue<? super T> queue) {\n+      super(key, queue);\n+      this.hashCode = key.hashCode(); // cache as hashCode is used for all future operations\n+    }\n+\n+    @Override public int hashCode() {\n+      return hashCode;\n+    }\n+\n+    @Override public String toString() {\n+      T value = get();\n+      return value != null ? value.toString() : \"ClearedReference()\";\n+    }\n+\n+    /**\n+     * While a lookup key will invoke equals against this, the visa versa is not true.
