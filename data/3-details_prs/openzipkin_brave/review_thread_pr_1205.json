Brave also considers propagation\n a separate api from the tracer.\n \n+### Why does `Setter` not allow putting `null`?\n+`Setter` cannot allow clearing values as it is not guaranteed to work. For\n+example, you can't clear headers made with `URLConnection`, only replace or add\n+to them.\n+\n+For this reason, when wrapping messages that are processed multiple times, such\n+as in messaging, you must clear keys on your own.\n+\n+There is a problem when an abstraction hides follow-up requests, such as\n+HTTP redirects or retries, as multiple requests will result in the same span.\n+This implies invalid timing and a repeated upstream ID seen by potentially\n+multiple servers! For this reason, always prefer sending headers (using\n+`Setter`) at the lowest abstraction possible, and raise issues with frameworks\n+that hide the ability to see follow-up requests.\n+\n+### Why does `Setter` not allow multiple values?\n+First, the most common multi-map header is HTTP, `Setter` also works on\n+messaging and RPC where multi-map fields are unusual.\n+\n+HTTP [RFC 7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2.2) allows encoding of multiple fields with the same name, but this\n+only applies to fields which define themselves as comma-separated. The `Setter`\n+abstraction has no knowledge of if the request is an HTTP request, and even if\n+it did, it wouldn't have knowledge of the format rules per field. That's the\n+responsibility of the `Propagation` implementation. Hence, the `Injector`,\n+which knows format rules, should do comma joining when valid.\n+\n+Some think that sending a header in comma-separated format, implies a receiver", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "7ee84125983a3160c204d4903122317e888ea412"}, "originalPosition": 46}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMjYzNDMzMTA1OnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "brave/RATIONALE.md", "isResolved": true, "comments": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNS0xMVQxMzowMjo1NlrOGTbPbg==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNS0xMVQxNDo0Mjo1MVrOGTfb8g==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyMzAyMjQ0Ng==", "bodyText": "you can still get null analysis from intellij if you add your custom annotation here", "url": "https://github.com/openzipkin/brave/pull/1205#discussion_r423022446", "createdAt": "2020-05-11T13:02:56Z", "author": {"login": "NersesAM"}, "path": "brave/RATIONALE.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -60,6 +60,15 @@ attempting to do that would limit the applicability of Brave, which is an anti-\n goal.
