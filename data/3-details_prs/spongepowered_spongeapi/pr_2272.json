This is not near being done but I haven't really touched this area of the code before so I want to make sure I'm doing the right things.\nThe biggest thing (at the moment!) is that I've changed HeightTypes and ChunkState to mirror the MCP entries. There will likely need to be some rejigging of the ProtoChunk and PrimitiveChunk interfaces. I also don't think loadChunk and unloadChunk should be on this interface - that should be on the associated World.\nSee the associated Common PR for the implementation.", "createdAt": "2020-12-05T16:41:25Z", "url": "https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeAPI/pull/2272", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "ec54a8e9ea92f5d12c0ff8e01a613e46d7d3f1d2"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2021-05-09T11:50:34Z", "author": {"login": "dualspiral"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 7, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABeRm7TUABqjQ2NTg1NTExODQ=", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABeVDwqeABqjQ3MTA2NzQ2NDQ=", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "HeadRefForcePushedEvent", "beforeCommit": {"oid": "e2cba264ded8e50f3162df1bcda285b48f51104a", "author": {"user": {"login": "dualspiral", "name": "Daniel Naylor"}}, "url": "https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeAPI/commit/e2cba264ded8e50f3162df1bcda285b48f51104a", "committedDate": "2020-12-05T16:35:06Z", "message": "Start morphing the Chunks API to fit Minecraft itself."}, "afterCommit": {"oid": "172a8f8eb2b4c96e604646cbeb8163fb64a78b53", "author": {"user": {"login": "dualspiral", "name": "Daniel Naylor"}}, "url": "https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeAPI/commit/172a8f8eb2b4c96e604646cbeb8163fb64a78b53", "committedDate": "2021-04-28T18:23:49Z", "message": "Move methods around to support how 1.16 works"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NjQ4OTE5MDA0", "url": "https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeAPI/pull/2272#pullrequestreview-648919004", "createdAt": "2021-04-30T06:39:24Z", "commit": {"oid": "76fe19644f08b4d523b520eaed42263143a3f807"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMS0wNC0zMFQwNjozOToyNVrOJSwRQA==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMS0wNC0zMFQwNjozOToyNVrOJSwRQA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDYyMzY0NDk5Mg==", "bodyText": "Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n             * <p>A chunk may not be attached to a world if it is in the process of being\n          \n          \n            \n             * generated.</p>\n          \n          \n            \n             * <p>A chunk may not be attached to a {@link World}, or a {@link org.spongepowered.api.world.generation.GenerationRegion}  if it is in the process of being\n          \n          \n            \n             * generated.</p>", "url": "https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeAPI/pull/2272#discussion_r623644992", "createdAt": "2021-04-30T06:39:25Z", "author": {"login": "gabizou"}, "path": "src/main/java/org/spongepowered/api/world/chunk/ProtoChunk.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -45,7 +45,11 @@\n  * chunk loading from storage, or empty chunks on clients.
