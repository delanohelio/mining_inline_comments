An in-memory\n+join is a performance improvement when a large dataset is being joined with a small dataset. In this\n+approach, the small dataset is loaded into memory and broadcast to workers and loaded into \n+workers memory. Once it is in memory, a join is performed by iterating through the elements of the\n+large dataset. With this approach, data from the large dataset is NEVER shuffled. Data with the \n+same key can be joined in parallel across the cluster instead of handled only by a single worker \n+providing optimal performance. Data sets that have a small size can be used for in-memory joins. \n+Make sure the total size of broadcast across and join does not exceed **2GB.**", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "1d5819ba2bcecb5d608ffba4cfa13c8b0b8fd3d5"}, "originalPosition": 45}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "d559bbd6b9b37cec2e36a6139932da239a7a8d46", "author": {"user": {"login": "MEseifan", "name": null}}, "url": "https://github.com/cdapio/hydrator-plugins/commit/d559bbd6b9b37cec2e36a6139932da239a7a8d46", "committedDate": "2020-07-28T18:15:46Z", "message": "(PLUGIN-303) Add distribution to Joiner Plugin"}}, {"__typename": "HeadRefForcePushedEvent", "beforeCommit": {"oid": "1d5819ba2bcecb5d608ffba4cfa13c8b0b8fd3d5", "author": {"user": {"login": "MEseifan", "name": null}}, "url": "https://github.com/cdapio/hydrator-plugins/commit/1d5819ba2bcecb5d608ffba4cfa13c8b0b8fd3d5", "committedDate": "2020-07-28T17:28:32Z", "message": "Added docs and addressed comments"}, "afterCommit": {"oid": "d559bbd6b9b37cec2e36a6139932da239a7a8d46", "author": {"user": {"login": "MEseifan", "name": null}}, "url": "https://github.com/cdapio/hydrator-plugins/commit/d559bbd6b9b37cec2e36a6139932da239a7a8d46", "committedDate": "2020-07-28T18:15:46Z", "message": "(PLUGIN-303) Add distribution to Joiner Plugin"}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 1563, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-01T13:07:16Z"}}}
