I guess the question I have is, is RawConfiguration actually meant to imply the layout of the maven/gradle configurations, or is it just meant to purely be a translation layer?

It can be independent, as long as it provides \"raw config values\" in a reasonable way. It's just that, because of the \"raw\" nature, I think in many cases it'll naturally resemble the configuration layout. The point is, we can choose whatever option that provides a better abstraction that makes sense. For example, returning a Map doesn't describe what the keys and the values mean; the caller should have advanced knowledge that the key is the source and the value is the target. In this sense, we could say returning a structured class has an advantage. But I am not so against using Map. This is up for discussions.\n\nUsing a map also forces people to avoid specifying 2 target directories for the same source directory. Is that something we want to support?\n\nI don't think we want to support that, at least not at the moment.
