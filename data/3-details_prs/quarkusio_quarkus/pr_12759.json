Use default `gcloud` configuration\n+2. Override the default JAR name to the one generated by the Quarkus Maven plugin\n+\n+Then you would be able to use Maven to build and deploy your application to App Engine via `mvn clean package appengine:deploy`.\n+\n+When done, the output will display the URL of your application (target url), you can use it with curl or directly open it on your browser using `gcloud app browse`.\n+\n+As the getting started endpoint is located on the `/hello` path, make sure to navigate to it.\n+\n+== Deploying to Google App Engine Flexible Custom Runtimes\n+\n+Before all, make sure to have an App Engine environment initialized for your Google Cloud project, if not, initialize one via `gcloud app create --project=[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]`.\n+\n+App Engine Flexible Custom Runtimes uses a Docker image to run your application.\n+\n+First, create an `app.yaml` file at the root of your project with the following content:\n+\n+[source, yaml]\n+----\n+runtime: custom\n+env: flex\n+----\n+\n+App Engine Flexible Custom Runtimes deploys your application as a Docker container, you can choose to deploy one of the Dockerfile provided inside your application.\n+\n+Both JVM and native executable versions will work.\n+\n+To deploy a JVM application:\n+\n+- Copy the JVM Dockerfile to the root directory of your project: `cp src/main/docker/Dockerfile.jvm Dockerfile`.\n+- Build your application using `mvn clean package`.\n+\n+To deploy a native application:\n+\n+- Copy the JVM Dockerfile to the root directory of your project: `cp src/main/docker/Dockerfile.native Dockerfile`.\n+- Build your application as a native executable using `mvn clean package -Pnative`.\n+\n+Finally, launch `gcloud app deploy` on the root of your project, it will upload all your project files (the list can be reduced via the  `.gcloudignore` file),\n+build your Dockerfile and launch it on App Engine Flexible custom runtime.\n+\n+It uses Cloud Build to build your Docker image and deploy it to Google Container Registry (GCR).\n+\n+When done, the output will display the URL of your application (target url), you can use it with curl or directly open it on your browser using `gcloud app browse`.\n+\n+As the getting started endpoint is located on the `/hello` path, make sure to navigate to it.\n+\n+NOTE: App Engine Flexible custom runtimes support link:https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/custom-runtimes/configuring-your-app-with-app-yaml#updated_health_checks[health checks],\n+it is strongly advised to provide them thanks to Quarkus link:microprofile-health[Microprofile Heath] support.\n+\n+== Deploying to Google Cloud Run\n+\n+Google Cloud Run allows you to run your Docker containers inside Google Cloud Platform in a managed way.\n+\n+NOTE: By default, Quarkus listens on port 8080, and it's also the Cloud Run default port.\n+No need to use the `PORT` environment variable defined in Cloud Run to customize the Quarkus HTTP port.\n+\n+Cloud Run will use Cloud Build to build your Docker image and deploy it to Google Container Registry (GCR).\n+\n+Both JVM and native executable versions will work.\n+\n+To deploy a JVM application:\n+\n+- Copy the JVM Dockerfile to the root directory of your project: `cp src/main/docker/Dockerfile.jvm Dockerfile`.\n+- Build your application using `mvn clean package`.\n+\n+To deploy a native application:\n+\n+- Copy the JVM Dockerfile to the root directory of your project: `cp src/main/docker/Dockerfile.native Dockerfile`.\n+- Build your application as a native executable using `mvn clean package -Pnative`.\n+\n+Then, create a `.gcloudignore` file to tell gcloud which file should be not be uploaded for Cloud Build,\n+without it, it defaults to `.gitignore` that usually exclude the target directory where you packaged application has been created.\n+\n+In this example, I only exclude the `src` directory:\n+\n+[source]\n+----\n+src/\n+----\n+[source]\n+\n+Then, use Cloud Build to build your image, it will upload to a Google Cloud Storage bucket all the files of your application (except the ones ignored by the `.gcloudignore`file),\n+build your Docker image and push it to Google Container Registry (GCR).\n+\n+[source, shell script]\n+----\n+gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/PROJECT-ID/helloworld\n+----\n+\n+NOTE: You can also build your image locally and push it to a publicly accessible Docker registry, then use this image in the next step.\n+\n+Finally, use Cloud Run to launch your application.\n+\n+[source, shell script]\n+----\n+gcloud run deploy --image gcr.io/PROJECT-ID/helloworld --platform managed\n+----\n+\n+Cloud run will ask you questions on the service name, the region and whether or not unauthenticated calls are allowed,\n+answer to these questions, and it will start deploying your application.\n+\n+When done, the output will display the URL of your application, you can use it to access your application.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "5ca35a17560559fb65581342b37beaf40d5ac466"}, "originalPosition":
