But if the state cookie is not set... it is the same situation :-).\nSo, putting this PR aside for the moment, when we have a code parameter set we assume it is part of the code flow response and therefore we expect that the state cookie is present. If it is not present, then until this PR, it is 401 (risk of the redirect loops otheriwise if we return the user back to IDP again - typically it is happening when say you access index.html on the 1st request and then /web-app/service on the redirect from IDP, etc, and if no cookie path/domain property is set).\nThe only cookie which we have always used to decide whether to redirect to IDP or not, based on its presence/absence is the session cookie. We only use the state cookie to coordinate the code flow.\nAnd with this PR, we have a situation where a code is coming on the 1st unauthenticated request, or, as it appears in the user case, after the session has expired, so yes, with the new option, we will give the users an option to redirect the users to IDP if the state cookie is absent to resolve the ambiguity with the custom code parameter vs a code returned by IDP.\nDoes it clarify it :-) ?", "url": "https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/12857#discussion_r513421477", "createdAt": "2020-10-28T12:59:41Z", "author": {"login": "sberyozkin"}, "path": "extensions/oidc/runtime/src/main/java/io/quarkus/oidc/runtime/CodeAuthenticationMechanism.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -278,13 +277,18 @@ private boolean shouldAutoRedirect(TenantConfigContext configContext, RoutingCon\n                 // Local redirect restoring the original request path, the state cookie is no longer needed\n                 removeCookie(context, configContext, getStateCookieName(configContext));\n             }\n+        } else if (configContext.oidcConfig.authentication.isChallengeWithoutStateCookie()) {\n+            LOG.debug(\"The state cookie is missing after a redirect from IDP, re-authentication is required\");\n+            return Uni.createFrom().optional(Optional.empty());\n         } else {\n             // State cookie must be available to minimize the risk of CSRF\n-            LOG.debug(\"The state cookie is missing after a redirect from IDP\");\n+            LOG.debug(\"The state cookie is missing after a redirect from IDP, authentication has failed\");", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxMjk4NzEwNg=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "870f4605ad80c4e709fdf6901eb5d82d5e02658e"}, "originalPosition": 18}]}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 4214, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-13T14:23:39Z"}}}
