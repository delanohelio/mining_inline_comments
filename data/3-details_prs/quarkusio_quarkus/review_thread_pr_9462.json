to start the profiler, and avoid your profile to be bloated with startup events. <br/>\n+Indeed, when an application start, it does a lot a bootstraping instruction, that will no more occur during the rest of the run of your application. <br/>\n+By starting the profiling when needed, you avoid these bootstrap instructions to be part of the profile.\n+\n+When you profile an application runtime, it's good to create some load on your application using a load generator tool (wrk, gatling, ...),\n+and to start profiling only after some warmup time to allow the Just In Time compiler of Java to optimize your application code (and your database cache to warmup, etc...).\n+\n+### CPU profiling\n+\n+To start CPU profiling, enter the following command:\n+\n+```shell script\n+./profiler.sh start -b 4000000 <pid>\n+```\n+\n+`-b 4000000` is used to increase the frame buffer size as the default is usually too small.\n+\n+To end profiling and gathering the result you can launch the same command with the `stop` subcommand, this will tells you if the buffer frame was too small. <br/>\n+The output is a text file that is not really usable, so let's use our preferred performance representation: The FlameGraph.\n+\n+```shell script\n+./profiler.sh stop -f /tmp/cpu-profile.svg --width 1600 <pid>\n+```\n+\n+It will create an SVG FlameGraph (Async Profiler automatically detect that you ask for a FlameGraph thanks to the svg extension)\n+that you can open in your browser (and even zoom inside it by clicking on a frame). <br/>\n+The example command will create an SVG of 1600 pixels width.\n+\n+One of our favorite options is `-s` (or `--simple`) that use simple class names instead of FQDNs, the FlameGraph will be more readable with it, but you will lose the package name. <br/>\n+You can also limit the profiling duration by using `-d` (or `--duration`) follow by the duration in seconds.\n+\n+### Allocation profiling\n+\n+To start allocation profiling, enter the following command:\n+\n+```shell script\n+./profiler.sh start -b 4000000 -e alloc <pid>\n+```\n+\n+`-e` (or `--event`) allow to give the event to profile, by default it's CPU, here we want allocation profiling.\n+\n+Then you can stop your profiling the same way as for CPU profiling.\n+\n+```shell script\n+./profiler.sh stop -f /tmp/alloc-profile.svg --width 1600 <pid>\n+```\n+\n+## Profiling application startup with Async Profiler\n+\n+When you want to profile application startup, you cannot use the command line tool as you need a way to start the profiler with your application.\n+\n+For this case, the Java agent is the best tool.\n+It will start profiling when you start the application, then record the profiling data when the application exits.\n+\n+Here is some example command lines:\n+\n+```shell script\n+# profile CPU startup\n+java -agentpath:/path/to/async-profiler/build/libasyncProfiler.so=start,event=cpu,file=startup-cpu-profile.svg,interval=1000000,width=1600,simple\\\n+    -jar my-application.jar\n+\n+# profile allocation startup\n+java -agentpath:/path/to/async-profiler/build/libasyncProfiler.so=start,event=alloc,file=/tmp/startup-alloc-profile.svg,interval=1000000,width=1600,simple\\\n+    -jar my-application.jar\n+```\n+\n+Be careful that short options are not supported inside the agent, you need to use the long version.\n+\n+By default, Async Profiler sample events each 10ms, for debugging Quarkus startup issue this is too much as we start very fast ;) <br/>\n+That's why I configure the profiling interval to 1000000ns (so 1ms).\n+\n+## Profiling application dev mode with Async Profiler\n+\n+For profiling Quarkus dev mode, you also need to use the Java agent, you can use it the same way as for production run, but you need to pass the `agentpath` option inside the `jvm.args` system property.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "cd3d3059e6d383d5b6334b6dad6afaba4eb174b5"}, "originalPosition": 132}]}}, {"id":

Quarkus Team,\n+you are more than welcome on our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/quarkus-dev),\n+[Zulip chat](https://quarkusio.zulipchat.com) or [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues).\n+\n+To help us to troubleshoot your issues, we will need some performance insight from your application.\n+\n+On Linux or macOS, one of the best way to gather performance insight would be to generate CPU and allocation [FlameGraphs](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph) \n+via [Async Profiler](https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler).\n+\n+If you want a deeper introduction to Async Profiler, go read [this article](https://hackernoon.com/profiling-java-applications-with-async-profiler-049s2790).\n+\n+## Installing Async Profiler\n+\n+To install Async Profiler, go to the [release page](https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler/releases) and download the latest release.\n+\n+Async Profiler depends on `perf_events`. <br/>\n+To allow capturing kernel call stacks using `perf_events` from a non-root process,\n+you must make some OS configuration.\n+\n+For your session:\n+\n+```shell script\n+echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid\n+echo 0 | sudo tee

install openjdk-8-dbg\n+\n+# Ubuntu/Debian - Java 11\n+ apt install openjdk-11-dbg\n+\n+# On CentOS, RHEL and some other RPM-based distributions\n+debuginfo-install java-1.8.0-openjdk\n+```\n+\n+If needed, see this section in the documentation site for details: [allocation profiling](https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler#allocation-profiling).\n+\n+## Profiling application runtime with Async Profiler\n+\n+Asych Profiler comes with a Java agent, and a command line.\n+\n+To profile application during its runtime, I recommend using the command line as you can choose when to start the profiler, and avoid your profile to be bloated with startup events. <br/>\n+Indeed, when an application start, it does a lot a bootstraping instruction, that will no more occur during the rest of the run of your application. <br/>\n+By starting the profiling when needed, you avoid these bootstrap instructions to be part of the profile.\n+\n+When you profile an application runtime, it's good to create some load on your application using a load generator tool (wrk, gatling, ...),\n+and to start profiling only after some warmup time to allow the Just In Time compiler of Java to optimize your application code (and your database cache to warmup, etc...).\n+\n+### CPU profiling\n+\n+To start CPU profiling, enter the following command:\n+\n+```shell script\n+./profiler.sh start -b 4000000 <pid>\n+```\n+\n+`-b 4000000` is used to increase the frame buffer size as the default is usually too small.\n+\n+To end profiling and gathering the result you can launch the same command with the `stop` subcommand, this will tells you if the buffer frame was too small. <br/>\n+The output is a text file that is not really usable, so let's use our preferred performance representation: The FlameGraph.\n+\n+```shell script\n+./profiler.sh stop -f /tmp/cpu-profile.svg --width 1600 <pid>\n+```\n+\n+It will create an SVG FlameGraph (Async Profiler automatically detect that you ask for a FlameGraph thanks to the svg extension)\n+that you can open in your browser (and even zoom inside it by clicking on a frame). <br/>\n+The example command will create an SVG of 1600 pixels width.\n+\n+One of our favorite options is `-s` (or `--simple`) that use simple class names instead of FQDNs, the FlameGraph will be more readable with it, but you will lose the package name. <br/>\n+You can also limit the profiling duration by using `-d` (or `--duration`) follow by the duration in seconds.\n+\n+### Allocation profiling\n+\n+To start allocation profiling, enter the following command:\n+\n+```shell script\n+./profiler.sh start -b 4000000 -e alloc <pid>\n+```\n+\n+`-e` (or `--event`) allow to give the event to profile, by default it's CPU, here we want allocation profiling.\n+\n+Then you can stop your profiling the same way as for CPU profiling.\n+\n+```shell script\n+./profiler.sh stop -f /tmp/alloc-profile.svg --width 1600 <pid>\n+```\n+\n+## Profiling application startup with Async Profiler\n+\n+When you want to profile application startup, you cannot use the command line tool as you need a way to start the profiler with your application.\n+\n+For this case, the Java agent is the best tool.\n+It will start profiling when you start the application, then record the profiling data when the application exits.\n+\n+Here is some example command
