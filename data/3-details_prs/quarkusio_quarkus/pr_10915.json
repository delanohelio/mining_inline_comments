#555\n+----\n+\n+Note that GitHub won't detect issues properly if you do something like\n+`Fix #444 #555`.\n+\n+== Affecting Labels and Milestones\n+\n+Affecting labels and milestones is very important in our process.\n+\n+Before each release, we check that we don't have any orphan i.e.\n+closed issues that don't have either a milestone affected or\n+some of the \"excluding\" labels.\n+\n+Thus:\n+\n+* when your merge a pull request, please affect it with the current milestone marked with \"master\".\n+* if the pull request has issues associated (i.e. if the pull request fixes some issues),\n+  also affect the milestone to the issues.\n+* if you close a pull request because we won't merge it, please add the appropriate `triage/` label:\n+  `triage/invalid`, `triage/out-of-date`, `triage/wontfix` are usually in order.\n+* if you close an issue because it has been fixed, either add the milestone\n+  if you can find it easily or use the `triage/out-of-date` if you can't.\n+* if you close an issue for any other reason, one of the aforementioned `triage/` labels\n+  is probably adequate.\n+\n+== Backporting Process\n+\n+When we release a new version of Quarkus, we usually do a bugfix\n+release a couple of weeks after.\n+\n+Everytime, we do a release, we create a release branch to host\n+the commits for these bugfix releases.\n+\n+All the pull requests are merged in master so for the new feature \n+release of Quarkus.\n+They won't be integrated in the previous version branch.\n+\n+One of your pull request might qualify for being backported to this\n+bugfix branch.\n+\n+Good examples of that might be:\n+\n+* bugfixes\n+* documentation fixes\n+* usability fixes\n+\n+Obviously, the barrier is higher for large pull requests as\n+they might be more risky to backport.\n+But sometimes, we just have to backport them anyway.\n+\n+If you think your pull request or the pull request you review might be a good backport candidate,\n+please add the `triage/backport?` label.\n+\n+The question mark is important:\n+it is not automatic and we carefully review each pull request before backporting.\n+\n+Thus, if not entirely clear, don't hesitate to add a comment to the pull request\n+when adding the label.\n+\n+And don't be surprised if we come to you with some questions about it\n+when we prepare the next bugfix release.\n+\n+== Good First Issues\n+\n+We need to find the right balance between fixing the issue right away\n+or try to get a new contributor onboard.\n+\n+It's not always easy to find it but if you think the issue is appropriate,\n+affecting it the `good first issue` label for some time might be a good thing.\n+\n+Obviously, critical bugs are not good candidates :).\n+\n+== I Did Something Wrong, What Should I Do?\n+\n+Take a deep breath and don't worry, it happens.\n+\n+Just ping @gsmet and @geoand and we will find a solution.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid":

person,\n+  make it a named reviewer via a GitHub UI\n+* if someone asked for a specific reviewer, better\n+  give some time for this person to review the PR.\n+  If not reviewed in a reasonable amount of time,\n+  better ping them again to have some information\n+  or ask the original author if we should go ahead.\n+* if in doubt (on a specific part or because you're\n+  not comfortable reviewing documentation or any other reason),\n+  ask for help\n+* except if it's a totally non brainer (typically a typo fix),\n+  let the PR bake a few hours so some other people can have a\n+  look if interested.\n+  If the PR is very large or is a new extension, better let it\n+  bake for a few days.\n+* we do merge commits so please ask the author to properly\n+  squash the commits before merging.\n+  The idea is to have proper semantic commits.\n+  If the author is not familiar with Git or not available,\n+  you can also (carefully) do it for them as soon as you agreed on it.\n+* make sure the commit comments are meaningful\n+* at the beginning, you can start by giving your approval and not merging\n+  and see how things evolve.\n+  This should give you some hints of important things to check in the future.\n+* only merge pull requests that target master.\n+  **Dealing with old branches is a separate process.**\n+* if you are sure a PR should go in and is just waiting for CI,\n+  just use the `triage/waiting-for-ci` label.\n+  It is a good hint for other committers.\n+* if you think a pull request is an essential part of a given milestone\n+  (and can realistically be part of it),\n+  you should affect this milestone to it so that we can be sure it stays on the radar.\n+\n+Obviously, each situation is different so use your own judgement,\n+and if in doubt, just ask for advice, the other committers are here to help.\n+\n+== Pull Request Title\n+\n+The title should be in English, should not contain an issue number.\n+It should also not contain ellipsis.\n+\n+If your commit message was too long and GitHub automatically cut\n+the title, that's helpful if you can take the time to move the cut\n+part where it belongs to have a full title.\n+\n+Titles are included in the Release notes so they are important.\n+\n+A good title would look like: `Fix XXX in Quartz extension` or\n+`Introduce Hibernate Reactive extension`.\n+\n+A bad title would look like: `fix(#444)`.\n+\n+== Issues Fixed\n+\n+When a PR fixes some issues, it's good practice to add it in the description.\n+\n+One issue per line with something like:\n+\n+[source,asciidoc]\n+----\n+* Fix #444\n+* Fix #555\n+----\n+\n+[NOTE]\n+====\n+GitHub won't detect issues properly if you do something like\n+`Fix #444 #555`.\n+====\n+\n+== Affecting Labels and Milestones\n+\n+Affecting labels and milestones is very important in our process.\n+\n+Before each release, we check that we don't have any orphan i.e.\n+closed issues that don't have either a milestone affected or\n+some of the \"excluding\" labels.\n+\n+Thus:\n+\n+* when you merge a pull request, please affect it with the current milestone marked with \"master\".\n+* if the pull request has issues associated (i.e. if the pull request fixes some issues),\n+  you should also affect the milestone assigned to the issues.\n+* if you close a pull request because the committers have decided to not merge it,\n+  please add the appropriate `triage/` label: `triage/invalid`, `triage/out-of-date`,\n+  `triage/wontfix` are usually in order.\n+* if you close an issue because it has been fixed, either add the milestone\n+  if you can find it easily or use the `triage/out-of-date` if you can't.\n+* if you close an issue for any other reason, one of the aforementioned `triage/` labels\n+  is probably adequate.\n+\n+== Backporting Process\n+\n+When we release a new version of Quarkus, we usually do a bugfix\n+release a couple of weeks after.\n+\n+Everytime, we do a release, we create a release branch to host\n+the commits for these bugfix releases.\n+\n+All the pull requests are merged in master so for the new feature \n+release of Quarkus.\n+They won't be integrated in the previous version branch.\n+\n+One of your pull requests might qualify for being backported to this\n+bugfix branch.\n+\n+Good examples of that might be:\n+\n+* bugfixes\n+* documentation fixes\n+* usability fixes\n+\n+Obviously, the barrier is higher for large pull requests as\n+they might be more risky to backport.\n+But sometimes, we just have to backport them anyway.\n+\n+If you think your pull request or the pull request you review might be a good backport candidate,\n+please add the `triage/backport?` label.\n+\n+The question mark is important:\n+it is not automatic and we carefully review each pull request before backporting.\n+\n+Thus, if not entirely clear, don't hesitate to add a comment to the pull request\n+when adding the label.\n+\n+And don't be surprised if we come to you with some questions about it\n+when we prepare the next bugfix release.\n+\n+== Good First Issues\n+\n+We need to find the right balance between fixing the issue right away\n+or try to get a new contributor onboard.\n+\n+It's not always easy to find it but if you think the issue is appropriate,\n+affecting it the `good first issue` label for some time might be a good thing.\n+\n+Obviously, critical bugs are not good candidates :).\n+\n+== I Did Something Wrong, What Should I Do?\n+\n+Take a deep breath and don't worry, it happens.\n+\n+Just ping https://github.com/gsmet/[Guillaume Smet (@gsmet)] and
