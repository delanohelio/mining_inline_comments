This is true for both JVM and native modes.\n+It provides similar functionality to the SAM CLI, without the overhead of Docker.\n+\n+To illustrate, the project generated by the Maven archetype, generates a JUnit test for the RequestHandler<?, ?>, which is shown below.\n+The test replicates the execution environment, for the function that is selected for invocation, as described <<choose, above>>.\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@QuarkusTest\n+public class LambdaHandlerTest {\n+\n+    @Test\n+    public void testSimpleLambdaSuccess() throws Exception {\n+        InputObject in = new InputObject();\n+        in.setGreeting(\"Hello\");\n+        in.setName(\"Stu\");\n+\n+        OutputObject out = LambdaClient.invoke(OutputObject.class, in);\n+\n+        Assertions.assertEquals(\"Hello Stu\", out.getResult());\n+        Assertions.assertTrue(out.getRequestId().matches(\"aws-request-\\\\d\"), \"Expected requestId as 'aws-request-<number>'\");\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+\n+Similarly, if you are using a RequestStreamHandler implementation, you can add a matching JUnit test, like below,\n+which aligns to the generated StreamLambda class in the generated project.\n+\n+Obviously, these two types of tests are mutually exclusive.  You must have a test that corresponds to the implemented AWS Lambda interfaces,\n+whether RequestHandler<?, ?> or RequestStreamHandler.\n+\n+Two versions of the Test for RequestStreamHandler are presented below.  You can use either, depending on\n+the needs of your Unit test.  The first is obviously simpler and quicker.

This is true for both JVM and native modes.\n+It provides similar functionality to the SAM CLI, without the overhead of Docker.\n+\n+To illustrate, the project generated by the Maven archetype, generates a JUnit test for the RequestHandler<?, ?>, which is shown below.\n+The test replicates the execution environment, for the function that is selected for invocation, as described <<choose, above>>.\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@QuarkusTest\n+public class LambdaHandlerTest {\n+\n+    @Test\n+    public void testSimpleLambdaSuccess() throws Exception {\n+        InputObject in = new InputObject();\n+        in.setGreeting(\"Hello\");\n+        in.setName(\"Stu\");\n+\n+        OutputObject out = LambdaClient.invoke(OutputObject.class, in);\n+\n+        Assertions.assertEquals(\"Hello Stu\", out.getResult());\n+        Assertions.assertTrue(out.getRequestId().matches(\"aws-request-\\\\d\"), \"Expected requestId as 'aws-request-<number>'\");\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+\n+Similarly, if you are using a RequestStreamHandler implementation, you can add a matching JUnit test, like below,\n+which aligns to the generated StreamLambda class in the generated project.\n+\n+Obviously, these two types of tests are mutually exclusive.  You must have a test that corresponds to the implemented AWS Lambda interfaces,\n+whether RequestHandler<?, ?> or RequestStreamHandler.\n+\n+Two versions of the Test for RequestStreamHandler are presented below.  You can use either, depending on\n+the needs of your Unit test.  The first is obviously simpler and quicker.

The AWS X-Ray\n library is not fully compatible with GraalVM so we had to do some integration work to make this work.\n+\n+In addition, remember to enable the AWS X-Ray tracing parameter in manage.sh, in the cmd_create() function.  This can also be set in the AWS Management Console.\n+[source]\n+----\n+    --tracing-config Mode=Active\n+----\n+\n+For the sam template files, add the following to the YAML function Properties.\n+[source]\n+----\n+    Tracing: Active\n+----\n+\n+AWS X-Ray does add many classes to your distribution, do ensure you are using at least the 256MB AWS Lambda memory size.  This is explicitly set in manage.sh cmd_create(). Whilst the native image potentially can always use a lower memory setting, it would be recommended to keep the setting the same, especially to help compare performance.\n+\n+[[https]]\n+== Using HTTPS or SSL/TLS\n+\n+If you code makes invokes HTTPS calls, such as to a micro-service (or AWS service), you will need to add configuration to the native image,\n+as GraalVM will only include the dependencies when explictly declared.

This is true for both JVM and native modes.\n+It provides similar functionality to the SAM CLI, without the overhead of Docker.\n+\n+To illustrate, the project generated by the Maven archetype, generates a JUnit test for the RequestHandler<?, ?>, which is shown below.\n+The test replicates the execution environment, for the function that is selected for invocation, as described <<choose, above>>.\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@QuarkusTest\n+public class LambdaHandlerTest {\n+\n+    @Test\n+    public void testSimpleLambdaSuccess() throws Exception {\n+        InputObject in = new InputObject();\n+        in.setGreeting(\"Hello\");\n+        in.setName(\"Stu\");\n+\n+        OutputObject out = LambdaClient.invoke(OutputObject.class, in);\n+\n+        Assertions.assertEquals(\"Hello Stu\", out.getResult());\n+        Assertions.assertTrue(out.getRequestId().matches(\"aws-request-\\\\d\"), \"Expected requestId as 'aws-request-<number>'\");\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+\n+Similarly, if you are using a RequestStreamHandler implementation, you can add a matching JUnit test, like below,\n+which aligns to the generated StreamLambda class in the generated project.\n+\n+Obviously, these two types of tests are mutually exclusive.  You must have a test that corresponds to the implemented AWS Lambda interfaces,\n+whether RequestHandler<?, ?> or RequestStreamHandler.\n+\n+Two versions of the Test for RequestStreamHandler are presented below.  You can use either, depending on\n+the needs of your Unit test.  The first is obviously simpler and quicker.

The AWS X-Ray\n library is not fully compatible with GraalVM so we had to do some integration work to make this work.\n+\n+In addition, remember to enable the AWS X-Ray tracing parameter in manage.sh, in the cmd_create() function.  This can also be set in the AWS Management Console.\n+[source]\n+----\n+    --tracing-config Mode=Active\n+----\n+\n+For the sam template files, add the following to the YAML function Properties.\n+[source]\n+----\n+    Tracing: Active\n+----\n+\n+AWS X-Ray does add many classes to your distribution, do ensure you are using at least the 256MB AWS Lambda memory size.

Whilst the native image potentially can always use a lower memory setting, it would be recommended to keep the setting the same, especially to help compare performance.\n+\n+[[https]]\n+== Using HTTPS or SSL/TLS\n+\n+If you code makes invokes HTTPS calls, such as to a micro-service (or AWS service), you will need to add configuration to the native image,\n+as GraalVM will only include the dependencies when explictly declared.

This is true for both JVM and native modes.\n+It provides similar functionality to the SAM CLI, without the overhead of Docker.\n+\n+To illustrate, the project generated by the Maven archetype, generates a JUnit test for the RequestHandler<?, ?>, which is shown below.\n+The test replicates the execution environment, for the function that is selected for invocation, as described <<choose, above>>.\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@QuarkusTest\n+public class LambdaHandlerTest {\n+\n+    @Test\n+    public void testSimpleLambdaSuccess() throws Exception {\n+        InputObject in = new InputObject();\n+        in.setGreeting(\"Hello\");\n+        in.setName(\"Stu\");\n+\n+        OutputObject out = LambdaClient.invoke(OutputObject.class, in);\n+\n+        Assertions.assertEquals(\"Hello Stu\", out.getResult());\n+        Assertions.assertTrue(out.getRequestId().matches(\"aws-request-\\\\d\"), \"Expected requestId as 'aws-request-<number>'\");\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+\n+Similarly, if you are using a RequestStreamHandler implementation, you can add a matching JUnit test, like below,\n+which aligns to the generated StreamLambda class in the generated project.\n+\n+Obviously, these two types of tests are mutually exclusive.  You must have a test that corresponds to the implemented AWS Lambda interfaces,\n+whether RequestHandler<?, ?> or RequestStreamHandler.\n+\n+Two versions of the Test for RequestStreamHandler are presented below.  You can use either, depending on\n+the needs of your Unit test.  The first is obviously simpler and quicker.

The AWS X-Ray\n library is not fully compatible with GraalVM so we had to do some integration work to make this work.\n+\n+In addition, remember to enable the AWS X-Ray tracing parameter in manage.sh, in the cmd_create() function.  This can also be set in the AWS Management Console.\n+[source]\n+----\n+    --tracing-config Mode=Active\n+----\n+\n+For the sam template files, add the following to the YAML function Properties.\n+[source]\n+----\n+    Tracing: Active\n+----\n+\n+AWS X-Ray does add many classes to your distribution, do ensure you are using at least the 256MB AWS Lambda memory size.  This is explicitly set in manage.sh cmd_create(). Whilst the native image potentially can always use a lower memory setting, it would be recommended to keep the setting the same, especially to help compare performance.\n+\n+[[https]]\n+== Using HTTPS or SSL/TLS\n+\n+If you code makes invokes HTTPS calls, such as to a micro-service (or AWS service), you will need to add configuration to the native image,\n+as GraalVM will only include the dependencies when explictly declared.

This is true for both JVM and native modes.\n+It provides similar functionality to the SAM CLI, without the overhead of Docker.\n+\n+To illustrate, the project generated by the Maven archetype, generates a JUnit test for the RequestHandler<?, ?>, which is shown below.\n+The test replicates the execution environment, for the function that is selected for invocation, as described <<choose, above>>.\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@QuarkusTest\n+public class LambdaHandlerTest {\n+\n+    @Test\n+    public void testSimpleLambdaSuccess() throws Exception {\n+        InputObject in = new InputObject();\n+        in.setGreeting(\"Hello\");\n+        in.setName(\"Stu\");\n+\n+        OutputObject out = LambdaClient.invoke(OutputObject.class, in);\n+\n+        Assertions.assertEquals(\"Hello Stu\", out.getResult());\n+        Assertions.assertTrue(out.getRequestId().matches(\"aws-request-\\\\d\"), \"Expected requestId as 'aws-request-<number>'\");\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+\n+Similarly, if you are using a RequestStreamHandler implementation, you can add a matching JUnit test, like below,\n+which aligns to the generated StreamLambda class in the generated project.\n+\n+Obviously, these two types of tests are mutually exclusive.

This is true for both JVM and native modes.\n+It provides similar functionality to the SAM CLI, without the overhead of Docker.\n+\n+To illustrate, the project generated by the Maven archetype, generates a JUnit test for the RequestHandler<?, ?>, which is shown below.\n+The test replicates the execution environment, for the function that is selected for invocation, as described <<choose, above>>.\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@QuarkusTest\n+public class LambdaHandlerTest {\n+\n+    @Test\n+    public void testSimpleLambdaSuccess() throws Exception {\n+        InputObject in = new InputObject();\n+        in.setGreeting(\"Hello\");\n+        in.setName(\"Stu\");\n+\n+        OutputObject out = LambdaClient.invoke(OutputObject.class, in);\n+\n+        Assertions.assertEquals(\"Hello Stu\", out.getResult());\n+        Assertions.assertTrue(out.getRequestId().matches(\"aws-request-\\\\d\"), \"Expected requestId as 'aws-request-<number>'\");\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+\n+Similarly, if you are using a RequestStreamHandler implementation, you can add a matching JUnit test, like below,\n+which aligns to the generated StreamLambda class in the generated project.\n+\n+Obviously, these two types of tests are mutually exclusive.

This is true for both JVM and native modes.\n+It provides similar functionality to the SAM CLI, without the overhead of Docker.\n+\n+To illustrate, the project generated by the Maven archetype, generates a JUnit test for the RequestHandler<?, ?>, which is shown below.\n+The test replicates the execution environment, for the function that is selected for invocation, as described <<choose, above>>.\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@QuarkusTest\n+public class LambdaHandlerTest {\n+\n+    @Test\n+    public void testSimpleLambdaSuccess() throws Exception {\n+        InputObject in = new InputObject();\n+        in.setGreeting(\"Hello\");\n+        in.setName(\"Stu\");\n+\n+        OutputObject out = LambdaClient.invoke(OutputObject.class, in);\n+\n+        Assertions.assertEquals(\"Hello Stu\", out.getResult());\n+        Assertions.assertTrue(out.getRequestId().matches(\"aws-request-\\\\d\"), \"Expected requestId as 'aws-request-<number>'\");\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+\n+Similarly, if you are using a RequestStreamHandler implementation, you can add a matching JUnit test, like below,\n+which aligns to the generated StreamLambda class in the generated project.\n+\n+Obviously, these two types of tests are mutually exclusive.

As we now need to execute a bootstrap script,\n+we have to rename the Quarkus image to a new name, here `boostrap.bin`, and use the below script as `bootstrap`.\n+\n+[source, shell]\n+----\n+./bootstrap.bin \\\n+    -Djava.library.path=${LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT}/ssl \\\n+    -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=${LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT}/ssl/cacerts \\\n+    -Djavax.net.ssl.trustAnchors=${LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT}/ssl/cacerts \\\n+    -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=changeit\n+----\n+\n+You final archive will look like this:\n+[source, shell]\n+----\n+jar tvf target/function.zip\n+\n+    bootstrap\n+    bootstrap.bin\n+    ssl/\n+    ssl/cacerts\n+    ssl/libsunec.so\n+----\n+\n+This can be automated with a new Maven assembly zip.xml, for a new profile, such function-zip.xml\n+\n+[source, xml]\n+----\n+<assembly xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/ASSEMBLY/2.0.0\"\n+          xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n+          xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/ASSEMBLY/2.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/assembly-2.0.0.xsd\">\n+    <id>function-package</id>\n+    <formats>\n+        <format>zip</format>\n+    </formats>\n+    <includeBaseDirectory>false</includeBaseDirectory>\n+    <files>\n+        <file>\n+            <source>${project.build.directory}${file.separator}${artifactId}-${version}-runner</source>\n+            <outputDirectory>${file.separator}</outputDirectory>\n+            <destName>bootstrap.bin</destName>\n+            <fileMode>755</fileMode>\n+        </file>\n+        <file>\n+            <source>${project.basedir}${file.separator}src${file.separator}main${file.separator}resources${file.separator}cacerts</source>\n+            <outputDirectory>${file.separator}ssl</outputDirectory>\n+            <destName>cacerts</destName>\n+            <fileMode>644</fileMode>\n+        </file>\n+        <file>\n+            <source>${project.basedir}${file.separator}src${file.separator}main${file.separator}resources${file.separator}bootstrap</source>\n+            <outputDirectory>${file.separator}</outputDirectory>\n+            <destName>bootstrap</destName>\n+            <fileMode>755</fileMode>\n+        </file>\n+        <file>\n+            <source>${project.basedir}${file.separator}src${file.separator}main${file.separator}resources${file.separator}libsunec.so</source>\n+            <outputDirectory>${file.separator}ssl</outputDirectory>\n+            <destName>libsunec.so</destName>\n+            <fileMode>755</fileMode>\n+        </file>\n+    </files>\n+</assembly>\n+----\n+\n+Maven profile to execute the new function.zip:\n+\n+[source, xml]\n+----\n+        <profile>\n+            <id>zip</id>\n+            <activation>\n+                <property>\n+                    <name>zip</name>\n+                </property>\n+            </activation>\n+            <build>\n+                <plugins>\n+                    <plugin>\n+                        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>\n+                        <artifactId>maven-assembly-plugin</artifactId>\n+                        <version>3.1.0</version>\n+                        <executions>\n+                            <execution>\n+                                <id>zip-assembly</id>\n+                                <phase>package</phase>\n+                                <goals>\n+                                    <goal>single</goal>\n+                                </goals>\n+                                <configuration>\n+                                    <finalName>function</finalName>\n+                                    <descriptors>\n+                                        <descriptor>src/assembly/function-zip.xml</descriptor>\n+                                    </descriptors>\n+                                    <attach>false</attach>\n+                                    <appendAssemblyId>false</appendAssemblyId>\n+                                </configuration>\n+                            </execution>\n+                        </executions>\n+                    </plugin>\n+                </plugins>\n+            </build>\n+        </profile>\n+----\n+\n+[[alexa]]\n+== Writing Skills with the Amazon Alexa ASK SDK v2\n+\n+The starting point for an Alexa Skill on AWS Lambda is typically via subclassing `SkillStreamHandler`,\n+which implements the RequestStreamHandler::requestHandler.
