System properties\n+2. Environment variables\n+3. A file named `.env` placed in the current working directory\n+4. A configuration file placed in `$PWD/config/application.properties`\n+5. An application configuration file, i.e. `src/main/resources/application.properties`\n+\n+=== System properties\n+\n+* for a runner jar: `java -Dquarkus.datasource.password=youshallnotpass -jar target/myapp-runner.jar`\n+* for a native executable: `./target/myapp-runner -Dquarkus.datasource.password=youshallnotpass`\n+\n+=== Environment variables\n+\n+* for a runner jar: `export QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=youshallnotpass ; java -jar target/myapp-runner.jar`\n+* for a native executable: `export QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=youshallnotpass ; ./target/myapp-runner`\n+\n+NOTE: Environment variables names are following the conversion rules of link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/blob/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/configsources.asciidoc#default-configsources[Eclipse MicroProfile]\n+\n+=== File named `.env` placed in the current working directory\n+\n+.Example `.env` file\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=youshallnotpass <1>\n+----\n+<1> The name `QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD` is converted using the same rules as for <<environment_variables>>.\n+\n+For dev mode, this file can be placed in the root of the project, but it is advised to not check it in to version control.\n+\n+NOTE: Environment variables without a configuration profile defined in `.env` file will overwrite all its related profiles in `application.properties`, e.g. `%test.application.value` is overwritten by `APPLICATION_VALUE` in `.env` file.\n+\n+=== A configuration file placed in `$PWD/config/application.properties`\n+\n+By placing an `application.properties` file inside a directory named `config` which resides in the directory where the application runs, any runtime properties defined in that file will override the default configuration. \n+Furthermore any runtime properties added to this file that were not part of the original `application.properties` file\n+_will also_ be taken into account.\n+This works in the same way for runner jar and the native executable.\n+\n+NOTE: The `config/application.properties` features is available in development mode as well. To make use of it, `config/application.properties` needs to be placed inside the build tool's output directory (`target` for Maven and `build/classes/java/main` for Gradle).\n+Keep in mind however that any cleaning operation from the build tool like `mvn clean` or `gradle clean` will remove the `config` directory as well.\n+\n+=== An application configuration file: `src/main/resources/application.properties`\n+\n+.Example `application.properties` file\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+greeting.message=hello <1>\n+quarkus.http.port=9090 <2>\n+----\n+<1> This is a user-defind configuration property.\n+<2> This is a configuration property consumed by `quarkus-vertx-http` extension.\n+\n+TIP: Quarkus supports the use of <<using_property_expressions,property expressions>> in the `application.properties` file.\n+\n+== Injecting configuration properties\n+\n+Quarkus uses https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config] annotations to inject the configuration properties in the application.\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.message\") <1>\n+String message;\n+----\n+<1> You can use `@Inject @ConfigProperty` or just `@ConfigProperty`.\n+The `@Inject` annotation is not necessary for members annotated with `@ConfigProperty`.\n+This behavior which differs from https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config].\n+\n+NOTE: If the application attempts to inject a configuration property that is not set, an error is thrown.\n+So you can quickly know when your configuration is complete.\n+\n+.More `@ConfigProperty` Examples\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.message\") <1>\n+String message;\n+\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.suffix\", defaultValue=\"!\") <2>\n+String suffix;\n+\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.name\")\n+Optional<String> name; <3>\n+----\n+<1> If you do not provide a value for this property, the application startup fails with `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.DeploymentException: No config value of type [class java.lang.String] exists for: greeting.message`.\n+<2> The default value is injected if the configuration does not provide a value for `greeting.suffix`.\n+<3> This property is optional - an empty `Optional` is injected if the configuration does not provide a value for `greeting.name`.\n+\n+== Programmatically access the configuration\n+\n+You can also access the configuration programmatically.\n+It can be handy to achieve dynamic lookup, or retrieve configured values from classes that are neither CDI beans or JAX-RS resources.\n+\n+You can access the configuration programmatically using `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.ConfigProvider.getConfig()` such as in:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+String databaseName = ConfigProvider.getConfig().getValue(\"database.name\", String.class);\n+Optional<String> maybeDatabaseName = ConfigProvider.getConfig().getOptionalValue(\"database.name\", String.class);\n+----\n+\n+[[using_configproperties]]\n+== Using @ConfigProperties\n+\n+As an alternative to injecting multiple related configuration values in the way that was shown in the previous example,\n+users can also use the `@io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties` annotation to group these properties together.\n+\n+For the greeting properties above, a `GreetingConfiguration` class could be created like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+package org.acme.config;\n+\n+import io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties;\n+import java.util.Optional;\n+\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\") <1>\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    private String message;\n+    private String suffix = \"!\"; <2>\n+    private Optional<String> name;\n+\n+    public String getMessage() {\n+        return message;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setMessage(String message) {\n+        this.message = message;\n+    }\n+\n+    public String getSuffix() {\n+        return suffix;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setSuffix(String suffix) {\n+        this.suffix = suffix;\n+    }\n+\n+    public Optional<String> getName() {\n+        return name;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setName(Optional<String> name) {\n+        this.name = name;\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+<1> `prefix` is optional. If not set then the prefix to be used will be determined by the class name. In this case it would still be `greeting` (since the `Configuration` suffix is removed). If the class were named `GreetingExtraConfiguration` then the resulting default prefix would be `greeting-extra`.\n+<2> `!` will be the default value if `greeting.suffix` is not set\n+\n+This class could then be injected into the `GreetingResource` using the familiar CDI `@Inject` annotation like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@Inject\n+GreetingConfiguration greetingConfiguration;\n+----\n+\n+Another alternative style provided by Quarkus is to create `GreetingConfiguration` as an interface like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+package org.acme.config;\n+\n+import io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties;\n+import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.inject.ConfigProperty;\n+import java.util.Optional;\n+\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public interface GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @ConfigProperty(name = \"message\") <1>\n+    String message();\n+\n+    @ConfigProperty(defaultValue = \"!\")\n+    String getSuffix(); <2>\n+\n+    Optional<String> getName(); <3>\n+}\n+----\n+<1> The `@ConfigProperty` annotation is needed because the name of the configuration property that the method corresponds to doesn't follow the getter method naming conventions\n+<2> In this case since `name` was not set, the corresponding property will be `greeting.suffix`.\n+<3> It is unnecessary to specify the `@ConfigProperty` annotation because the method name follows the getter method naming conventions (`greeting.name` being the corresponding property) and no default value is needed.\n+\n+When using `@ConfigProperties` on a class or an interface, if the value of one of its fields is not provided, the application startup will fail and a `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.DeploymentException` indicating the missing value information will be thrown.\n+This does not apply to `Optional` fields and fields with a default value.\n+\n+=== Additional notes on @ConfigProperties\n+\n+When using a regular class annotated with `@ConfigProperties` the class doesn't necessarily have to declare getters and setters.\n+Having simple public non-final fields is valid as well.\n+\n+Furthermore, the configuration classes support nested object configuration. Suppose there was a need to have an extra layer\n+of greeting configuration named `content` that would contain a few fields. This could be achieved like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+    public Optional<String> name;\n+    public ContentConfig content; <1>\n+\n+    public static class ContentConfig {\n+        public Integer prizeAmount;\n+        public List<String> recipients;\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+<1> The name of the field (not the class name) will determine the name of the properties that are bound to the object.\n+\n+Setting the properties would occur in the normal manner, for example in `application.properties` one could have:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+greeting.message = hello\n+greeting.name = quarkus\n+greeting.content.prize-amount=10\n+greeting.content.recipients=Jane,John\n+----\n+\n+Furthermore, classes annotated with `@ConfigProperties` can be annotated with Bean Validation annotations similar to the following example:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @Size(min = 20)\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+\n+}\n+----\n+\n+WARNING: For validation to work, the `quarkus-hibernate-validator` extension needs to be present.\n+\n+If the validation fails with the given configuration, the application will fail to start and indicate the corresponding validation errors in the log.\n+\n+In the case of an interface being annotated with `@ConfigProperties`, the interface is allowed to extend other interfaces and methods from\n+the entire interface hierarchy are used to bind properties.\n+\n+=== Using same ConfigProperties with different prefixes\n+\n+Quarkus also supports the use of the same `@ConfigProperties` object with different prefixes for each injection point using the `io.quarkus.arc.config.@ConfigPrefix` annotation.\n+Say for example that `GreetingConfiguration` from above needs to be used for both the `greeting` prefix and the `other` prefix.\n+In that case the code would look like so:\n+\n+`GreetingConfiguration.java`\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @Size(min = 20)\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+\n+}\n+----\n+\n+`SomeBean.java`\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ApplicationScoped\n+public class SomeBean {\n+\n+    @Inject <1>\n+    GreetingConfiguration greetingConfiguration;\n+\n+    @ConfigPrefix(\"other\") <2>\n+    GreetingConfiguration otherConfiguration;\n+\n+}\n+----\n+<1> At this injection point `greetingConfiguration` will use the `greeting` prefix since that is what has been defined on `@ConfigProperties`.\n+<2> At this injection point `otherConfiguration` will use the `other` prefix from `@ConfigPrefix` instead of the `greeting` prefix. Notice that in this case `@Inject` is not required.\n+\n+[[configuration_profiles]]\n+== Configuration Profiles\n+\n+Quarkus supports the notion of configuration profiles. \n+These allow you to have multiple configurations in the same file and select between them via a profile name.\n+\n+The syntax for this is `%{profile}.config.key=value`. For example if I have the following:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+quarkus.http.port=9090\n+%dev.quarkus.http.port=8181\n+----\n+\n+The Quarkus HTTP port will be 9090, unless the `dev` profile is active, in which case it will be 8181.\n+\n+To use profiles in the `.env` file, you can follow a `_{PROFILE}_CONFIG_KEY=value` pattern. An equivalent of the above example in an `.env` file would be:\n+\n+[source,.env]\n+----\n+QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=9090\n+_DEV_QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=8181\n+----\n+\n+By default Quarkus has three profiles, although it is possible to use as many as you like. \n+The default profiles are:\n+\n+* *dev* - Activated when in development mode (i.e. `quarkus:dev`)\n+* *test* - Activated when running tests\n+* *prod* - The default profile when not running in development or test mode\n+\n+There are two ways to set a custom profile, either via the `quarkus.profile` system property or the `QUARKUS_PROFILE`\n+environment variable. If both are set the system property takes precedence. Note that it is not necessary to\n+define the names of these profiles anywhere, all that is necessary is to create a config property with the profile\n+name, and then set the current profile to that name. For example if I want a `staging` profile with a different HTTP port I can add the following to `application.properties`:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+quarkus.http.port=9090\n+%staging.quarkus.http.port=9999\n+----\n+\n+And then set the `QUARKUS_PROFILE` environment variable to `staging` to activate my profile.\n+\n+[NOTE]\n+====\n+The proper way to check the active profile programmatically is to use the `getActiveProfile` method of `io.quarkus.runtime.configuration.ProfileManager`.\n+\n+Using `@ConfigProperty(\"quarkus.profile\")` will *not* work properly.\n+====\n+\n+=== Default Runtime Profile\n+\n+The default Quarkus application runtime profile is set to the profile used to build the application.\n+For example:\n+[source,bash]\n+----\n+./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.profile=prod-aws\n+./target/my-app-1.0-runner // <1>\n+----\n+<1> The command will run with the `prod-aws` profile. This can be overridden using the `quarkus.profile` system property.\n+\n+\n+[[using_property_expressions]]\n+== Using Property Expressions\n+\n+Quarkus supports the use of property expressions in the `application.properties` file.\n+\n+These expressions are resolved when the property is read.\n+So if your configuration property is a build time configuration property, the property expression will be resolved at build time.\n+If your configuration property is overridable at runtime, the property expression will be resolved at runtime.\n+\n+You can use property expressions both for the Quarkus configuration or for your own configuration properties.\n+\n+Property expressions are defined this way: `${my-property-expression}`.\n+\n+For example, having the following property:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+remote.host=quarkus.io\n+----\n+and another property defined as:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+callable.url=https://${remote.host}/\n+----\n+\n+will result in the value of the `callable.url` property being set to:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+callable.url=https://quarkus.io/\n+----\n+\n+Another example would be defining different database servers depending on the profile used:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+%dev.quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://remotehost:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+----\n+\n+can be simplified by having:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+%dev.application.server=localhost\n+application.server=remotehost\n+\n+quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://${application.server}:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+----\n+\n+It does result in one more line in this example but the value of `application.server` can be reused in other properties,\n+diminishing the possibility of typos and providing more flexibility in property definitions.\n+\n+\n+[#combine-property-env-var]\n+== Combining Property Expressions and Environment Variables\n+\n+Quarkus also supports the combination of both property expressions and environment variables.\n+\n+Let's assume you have following property defined in `application.properties`:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+remote.host=quarkus.io\n+----\n+\n+You can combine environment variables and property expressions by having a property defined as follows:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+application.host=${HOST:${remote.host}}\n+----\n+\n+This will expand the `HOST` environment variable and use the value of the property `remote.host` as the default value if `HOST` is not set.\n+\n+For the purpose of this section we used the property `remote.host` we defined previously.\n+It has to be noted that the value could have been a fixed one such as in:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+application.host=${HOST:localhost}\n+----\n+\n+which will result in `localhost` as the default value if `HOST` is not set.\n+\n+[[configuring_quarkus]]\n+== Configuring Quarkus\n+\n+Quarkus itself is configured via the same mechanism as your application. Quarkus reserves the `quarkus.` namespace\n+for its own configuration.

If not set then the prefix to be used will be determined by the class name. In this case it would still be `greeting` (since the `Configuration` suffix is removed). If the class were named `GreetingExtraConfiguration` then the resulting default prefix would be `greeting-extra`.\n+<2> `!` will be the default value if `greeting.suffix` is not set\n+\n+This class could then be injected into the `GreetingResource` using the familiar CDI `@Inject` annotation like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@Inject\n+GreetingConfiguration greetingConfiguration;\n+----\n+\n+Another alternative style provided by Quarkus is to create `GreetingConfiguration` as an interface like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+package org.acme.config;\n+\n+import io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties;\n+import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.inject.ConfigProperty;\n+import java.util.Optional;\n+\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public interface GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @ConfigProperty(name = \"message\") <1>\n+    String message();\n+\n+    @ConfigProperty(defaultValue = \"!\")\n+    String getSuffix(); <2>\n+\n+    Optional<String> getName(); <3>\n+}\n+----\n+<1> The `@ConfigProperty` annotation is needed because the name of the configuration property that the method corresponds to doesn't follow the getter method naming conventions\n+<2> In this case since `name` was not set, the corresponding property will be `greeting.suffix`.\n+<3> It is unnecessary to specify the `@ConfigProperty` annotation because the method name follows the getter method naming conventions (`greeting.name` being the corresponding property) and no default value is needed.\n+\n+When using `@ConfigProperties` on a class or an interface, if the value of one of its fields is not provided, the application startup will fail and a `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.DeploymentException` indicating the missing value information will be thrown.\n+This does not apply to `Optional` fields and fields with a default value.\n+\n+=== Additional notes on @ConfigProperties\n+\n+When using a regular class annotated with `@ConfigProperties` the class doesn't necessarily have to declare getters and setters.\n+Having simple public non-final fields is valid as well.\n+\n+Furthermore, the configuration classes support nested object configuration. Suppose there was a need to have an extra layer\n+of greeting configuration named `content` that would contain a few fields. This could be achieved like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+    public Optional<String> name;\n+    public ContentConfig content; <1>\n+\n+    public static class ContentConfig {\n+        public Integer prizeAmount;\n+        public List<String> recipients;\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+<1> The name of the field (not the class name) will determine the name of the properties that are bound to the object.\n+\n+Setting the properties would occur in the normal manner, for example in `application.properties` one could have:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+greeting.message = hello\n+greeting.name = quarkus\n+greeting.content.prize-amount=10\n+greeting.content.recipients=Jane,John\n+----\n+\n+Furthermore, classes annotated with `@ConfigProperties` can be annotated with Bean Validation annotations similar to the following example:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @Size(min = 20)\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+\n+}\n+----\n+\n+WARNING: For validation to work, the `quarkus-hibernate-validator` extension needs to be present.\n+\n+If the validation fails with the given configuration, the application will fail to start and indicate the corresponding validation errors in the log.\n+\n+In the case of an interface being annotated with `@ConfigProperties`, the interface is allowed to extend other interfaces and methods from\n+the entire interface hierarchy are used to bind properties.\n+\n+=== Using same ConfigProperties with different prefixes\n+\n+Quarkus also supports the use of the same `@ConfigProperties` object with different prefixes for each injection point using the `io.quarkus.arc.config.@ConfigPrefix` annotation.\n+Say for example that `GreetingConfiguration` from above needs to be used for both the `greeting` prefix and the `other` prefix.\n+In that case the code would look like so:\n+\n+`GreetingConfiguration.java`\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @Size(min = 20)\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+\n+}\n+----\n+\n+`SomeBean.java`\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ApplicationScoped\n+public class SomeBean {\n+\n+    @Inject <1>\n+    GreetingConfiguration greetingConfiguration;\n+\n+    @ConfigPrefix(\"other\") <2>\n+    GreetingConfiguration otherConfiguration;\n+\n+}\n+----\n+<1> At this injection point `greetingConfiguration` will use the `greeting` prefix since that is what has been defined on `@ConfigProperties`.\n+<2> At this injection point `otherConfiguration` will use the `other` prefix from `@ConfigPrefix` instead of the `greeting` prefix. Notice that in this case `@Inject` is not required.\n+\n+[[configuration_profiles]]\n+== Configuration Profiles\n+\n+Quarkus supports the notion of configuration profiles. \n+These allow you to have multiple configurations in the same file and select between them via a profile name.\n+\n+The syntax for this is `%{profile}.config.key=value`. For example if I have the following:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+quarkus.http.port=9090\n+%dev.quarkus.http.port=8181\n+----\n+\n+The Quarkus HTTP port will be 9090, unless the `dev` profile is active, in which case it will be 8181.\n+\n+To use profiles in the `.env` file, you can follow a `_{PROFILE}_CONFIG_KEY=value` pattern. An equivalent of the above example in an `.env` file would be:\n+\n+[source,.env]\n+----\n+QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=9090\n+_DEV_QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=8181\n+----\n+\n+By default Quarkus has three profiles, although it is possible to use as many as you like. \n+The default profiles are:\n+\n+* *dev* - Activated when in development mode (i.e. `quarkus:dev`)\n+* *test* - Activated when running tests\n+* *prod* - The default profile when not running in development or test mode\n+\n+There are two ways to set a custom profile, either via the `quarkus.profile` system property or the `QUARKUS_PROFILE`\n+environment variable. If both are set the system property takes precedence. Note that it is not necessary to\n+define the names of these profiles anywhere, all that is necessary is to create a config property with the profile\n+name, and then set the current profile to that name. For example if I want a `staging` profile with a different HTTP port I can add the following to `application.properties`:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+quarkus.http.port=9090\n+%staging.quarkus.http.port=9999\n+----\n+\n+And then set the `QUARKUS_PROFILE` environment variable to `staging` to activate my profile.\n+\n+[NOTE]\n+====\n+The proper way to check the active profile programmatically is to use the `getActiveProfile` method of `io.quarkus.runtime.configuration.ProfileManager`.\n+\n+Using `@ConfigProperty(\"quarkus.profile\")` will *not* work properly.\n+====\n+\n+=== Default Runtime Profile\n+\n+The default Quarkus application runtime profile is set to the profile used to build the application.\n+For example:\n+[source,bash]\n+----\n+./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.profile=prod-aws\n+./target/my-app-1.0-runner // <1>\n+----\n+<1> The command will run with the `prod-aws` profile. This can be overridden using the `quarkus.profile` system property.\n+\n+\n+[[using_property_expressions]]\n+== Using Property Expressions\n+\n+Quarkus supports the use of property expressions in the `application.properties` file.\n+\n+These expressions are resolved when the property is read.\n+So if your configuration property is a build time configuration property, the property expression will be resolved at build time.\n+If your configuration property is overridable at runtime, the property expression will be resolved at runtime.\n+\n+You can use property expressions both for the Quarkus configuration or for your own configuration properties.\n+\n+Property expressions are defined this way: `${my-property-expression}`.\n+\n+For example, having the following property:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+remote.host=quarkus.io\n+----\n+and another property defined as:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+callable.url=https://${remote.host}/\n+----\n+\n+will result in the value of the `callable.url` property being set to:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+callable.url=https://quarkus.io/\n+----\n+\n+Another example would be defining different database servers depending on the profile used:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+%dev.quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://remotehost:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+----\n+\n+can be simplified by having:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+%dev.application.server=localhost\n+application.server=remotehost\n+\n+quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://${application.server}:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+----\n+\n+It does result in one more line in this example but the value of `application.server` can be reused in other properties,\n+diminishing the possibility of typos and providing more flexibility in property definitions.\n+\n+\n+[#combine-property-env-var]\n+== Combining Property Expressions and Environment Variables\n+\n+Quarkus also supports the combination of both property expressions and environment variables.\n+\n+Let's assume you have following property defined in `application.properties`:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+remote.host=quarkus.io\n+----\n+\n+You can combine environment variables and property expressions by having a property defined as follows:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+application.host=${HOST:${remote.host}}\n+----\n+\n+This will expand the `HOST` environment variable and use the value of the property `remote.host` as the default value if `HOST` is not set.\n+\n+For the purpose of this section we used the property `remote.host` we defined previously.\n+It has to be noted that the value could have been a fixed one such as in:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+application.host=${HOST:localhost}\n+----\n+\n+which will result in `localhost` as the default value if `HOST` is not set.\n+\n+[[configuring_quarkus]]\n+== Configuring Quarkus\n+\n+Quarkus itself is configured via the same mechanism as your application. Quarkus reserves the `quarkus.` namespace\n+for its own configuration. For example to configure the HTTP server port you can set `quarkus.http.port` in\n+`application.properties`. All the Quarkus configuration properties are link:all-config[documented and searchable].\n+\n+[IMPORTANT]\n+====\n+As mentioned above, properties prefixed with `quarkus.` are effectively reserved for configuring Quarkus itself and\n+therefore `quarkus.` should **never** be used as prefix for application specific properties.\n+\n+In the previous examples using `quarkus.message` instead of `greeting.message` would result in unexpected behavior.\n+====\n+\n+Quarkus does much of its configuration and bootstrap at build time and most configuration properties are read and used during the build.\n+These properties are _fixed at build time_ and it's not possible to change them at runtime.\n+You always need to repackage your application in order to reflect changes of such properties.\n+\n+TIP: The properties fixed at build time are marked with a lock icon (icon:lock[]) in the link:all-config[list of all configuration options].\n+\n+However, some extensions do define properties _overridable at runtime_.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "9f71aede594314e5030837e8e9bd979d87c5d332"}, "originalPosition": 476}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyNzY4Nzg2OA==", "bodyText": "Hm, I'll change this to \"However, some extensions do define properties that can be overriden at runtime.\"", "url": "https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/13402#discussion_r527687868", "createdAt": "2020-11-20T13:24:55Z", "author": {"login": "mkouba"}, "path": "docs/src/main/asciidoc/config-reference.adoc", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,771 @@\n+////\n+This guide is maintained in the main Quarkus repository\n+and pull requests should be submitted there:\n+https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/tree/master/docs/src/main/asciidoc\n+////\n+= Quarkus - Configuration Reference Guide\n+\n+include::./attributes.adoc[]\n+\n+:numbered:\n+:sectnums:\n+:sectnumlevels: 4\n+:toc:\n+\n+In this reference guide we're going to describe various aspects of Quarkus configuration.\n+A Quarkus application and Quarkus itself (core and extensions) are both configured via the same mechanism that leverages the https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config] API.\n+Quarkus configuration is based on https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-config[SmallRye Config], an implementation of the MicroProfile Config specification.\n+All of the standard features are supported.\n+Moreover, there are several additional features which are made available by the SmallRye Config project as well as by Quarkus itself.\n+\n+TIP: If you're looking for information how to make a Quarkus extension configurable then see the <<writing-extensions.adoc#configuration,Writing Your Own Extension>> guide.\n+\n+[[configuration_sources]]\n+== Configuration Sources\n+\n+By default, Quarkus reads configuration properties from several sources (in decreasing priority):\n+\n+1.

Notice that in this case `@Inject` is not required.\n+\n+[[configuration_profiles]]\n+== Configuration Profiles\n+\n+Quarkus supports the notion of configuration profiles. \n+These allow you to have multiple configurations in the same file and select between them via a profile name.\n+\n+The syntax for this is `%{profile}.config.key=value`. For example if I have the following:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+quarkus.http.port=9090\n+%dev.quarkus.http.port=8181\n+----\n+\n+The Quarkus HTTP port will be 9090, unless the `dev` profile is active, in which case it will be 8181.\n+\n+To use profiles in the `.env` file, you can follow a `_{PROFILE}_CONFIG_KEY=value` pattern. An equivalent of the above example in an `.env` file would be:\n+\n+[source,.env]\n+----\n+QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=9090\n+_DEV_QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=8181\n+----\n+\n+By default Quarkus has three profiles, although it is possible to use as many as you like. \n+The default profiles are:\n+\n+* *dev* - Activated when in development mode (i.e. `quarkus:dev`)\n+* *test* - Activated when running tests\n+* *prod* - The default profile when not running in development or test mode\n+\n+There are two ways to set a custom profile, either via the `quarkus.profile` system property or the `QUARKUS_PROFILE`\n+environment variable. If both are set the system property takes precedence. Note that it is not necessary to\n+define the names of these profiles anywhere, all that is necessary is to create a config property with the profile\n+name, and then set the current profile to that name. For example if I want a `staging` profile with a different HTTP port I can add the following to `application.properties`:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+quarkus.http.port=9090\n+%staging.quarkus.http.port=9999\n+----\n+\n+And then set the `QUARKUS_PROFILE` environment variable to `staging` to activate my profile.\n+\n+[NOTE]\n+====\n+The proper way to check the active profile programmatically is to use the `getActiveProfile` method of `io.quarkus.runtime.configuration.ProfileManager`.\n+\n+Using `@ConfigProperty(\"quarkus.profile\")` will *not* work properly.\n+====\n+\n+=== Default Runtime Profile\n+\n+The default Quarkus application runtime profile is set to the profile used to build the application.\n+For example:\n+[source,bash]\n+----\n+./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.profile=prod-aws\n+./target/my-app-1.0-runner // <1>\n+----\n+<1> The command will run with the `prod-aws` profile. This can be overridden using the `quarkus.profile` system property.\n+\n+\n+[[using_property_expressions]]\n+== Using Property Expressions\n+\n+Quarkus supports the use of property expressions in the `application.properties` file.\n+\n+These expressions are resolved when the property is read.\n+So if your configuration property is a build time configuration property, the property expression will be resolved at build time.\n+If your configuration property is overridable at runtime, the property expression will be resolved at runtime.\n+\n+You can use property expressions both for the Quarkus configuration or for your own configuration properties.\n+\n+Property expressions are defined this way: `${my-property-expression}`.\n+\n+For example, having the following property:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+remote.host=quarkus.io\n+----\n+and another property defined as:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+callable.url=https://${remote.host}/\n+----\n+\n+will result in the value of the `callable.url` property being set to:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+callable.url=https://quarkus.io/\n+----\n+\n+Another example would be defining different database servers depending on the profile used:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+%dev.quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://remotehost:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+----\n+\n+can be simplified by having:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+%dev.application.server=localhost\n+application.server=remotehost\n+\n+quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://${application.server}:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+----\n+\n+It does result in one more line in this example but the value of `application.server` can be reused in other properties,\n+diminishing the possibility of typos and providing more flexibility in property definitions.\n+\n+\n+[#combine-property-env-var]\n+== Combining Property Expressions and Environment Variables\n+\n+Quarkus also supports the combination of both property expressions and environment variables.\n+\n+Let's assume you have following property defined in `application.properties`:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+remote.host=quarkus.io\n+----\n+\n+You can combine environment variables and property expressions by having a property defined as follows:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+application.host=${HOST:${remote.host}}\n+----\n+\n+This will expand the `HOST` environment variable and use the value of the property `remote.host` as the default value if `HOST` is not set.\n+\n+For the purpose of this section we used the property `remote.host` we defined previously.\n+It has to be noted that the value could have been a fixed one such as in:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+application.host=${HOST:localhost}\n+----\n+\n+which will result in `localhost` as the default value if `HOST` is not set.\n+\n+[[configuring_quarkus]]\n+== Configuring Quarkus\n+\n+Quarkus itself is configured via the same mechanism as your application. Quarkus reserves the `quarkus.` namespace\n+for its own configuration. For example to configure the HTTP server port you can set `quarkus.http.port` in\n+`application.properties`. All the Quarkus configuration properties are link:all-config[documented and searchable].\n+\n+[IMPORTANT]\n+====\n+As mentioned above, properties prefixed with `quarkus.` are effectively reserved for configuring Quarkus itself and\n+therefore `quarkus.` should **never** be used as prefix for application specific properties.\n+\n+In the previous examples using `quarkus.message` instead of `greeting.message` would result in unexpected behavior.\n+====\n+\n+Quarkus does much of its configuration and bootstrap at build time and most configuration properties are read and used during the build.\n+These properties are _fixed at build time_ and it's not possible to change them at runtime.\n+You always need to repackage your application in order to reflect changes of such properties.\n+\n+TIP: The properties fixed at build time are marked with a lock icon (icon:lock[]) in the link:all-config[list of all configuration options].\n+\n+However, some extensions do define properties _overridable at runtime_.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyNzY4NzAyNA=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "9f71aede594314e5030837e8e9bd979d87c5d332"}, "originalPosition": 476}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyNzY4OTc2Mw==", "bodyText": "\ud83d\udc4d", "url": "https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/13402#discussion_r527689763", "createdAt": "2020-11-20T13:28:19Z", "author": {"login": "geoand"}, "path": "docs/src/main/asciidoc/config-reference.adoc", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,771 @@\n+////\n+This guide is maintained in the main Quarkus repository\n+and pull requests should be submitted there:\n+https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/tree/master/docs/src/main/asciidoc\n+////\n+= Quarkus - Configuration Reference Guide\n+\n+include::./attributes.adoc[]\n+\n+:numbered:\n+:sectnums:\n+:sectnumlevels: 4\n+:toc:\n+\n+In this reference guide we're going to describe various aspects of Quarkus configuration.\n+A Quarkus application and Quarkus itself (core and extensions) are both configured via the same mechanism that leverages the https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config] API.\n+Quarkus configuration is based on https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-config[SmallRye Config], an implementation of the MicroProfile Config specification.\n+All of the standard features are supported.\n+Moreover, there are several additional features which are made available by the SmallRye Config project as well as by Quarkus itself.\n+\n+TIP: If you're looking for information how to make a Quarkus extension configurable then see the <<writing-extensions.adoc#configuration,Writing Your Own Extension>> guide.\n+\n+[[configuration_sources]]\n+== Configuration Sources\n+\n+By default, Quarkus reads configuration properties from several sources (in decreasing priority):\n+\n+1. System properties\n+2. Environment variables\n+3. A file named `.env` placed in the current working directory\n+4. A configuration file placed in `$PWD/config/application.properties`\n+5. An application configuration file, i.e. `src/main/resources/application.properties`\n+\n+=== System properties\n+\n+* for a runner jar: `java -Dquarkus.datasource.password=youshallnotpass -jar target/myapp-runner.jar`\n+* for a native executable: `./target/myapp-runner -Dquarkus.datasource.password=youshallnotpass`\n+\n+=== Environment variables\n+\n+* for a runner jar: `export QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=youshallnotpass ; java -jar target/myapp-runner.jar`\n+* for a native executable: `export QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=youshallnotpass ; ./target/myapp-runner`\n+\n+NOTE: Environment variables names are following the conversion rules of link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/blob/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/configsources.asciidoc#default-configsources[Eclipse MicroProfile]\n+\n+=== File named `.env` placed in the current working directory\n+\n+.Example `.env` file\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=youshallnotpass <1>\n+----\n+<1> The name `QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD` is converted using the same rules as for <<environment_variables>>.\n+\n+For dev mode, this file can be placed in the root of the project, but it is advised to **not** check it in to version control.\n+\n+NOTE: Environment variables without a configuration profile defined in `.env` file will overwrite all its related profiles in `application.properties`, e.g. `%test.application.value` is overwritten by `APPLICATION_VALUE` in `.env` file.\n+\n+=== A configuration file placed in `$PWD/config/application.properties`\n+\n+By placing an `application.properties` file inside a directory named `config` which resides in the directory where the application runs, any runtime properties defined in that file will override the default configuration. \n+Furthermore any runtime properties added to this file that were not part of the original `application.properties` file\n+_will also_ be taken into account.\n+This works in the same way for runner jar and the native executable.\n+\n+NOTE: The `config/application.properties` features is available in development mode as well. To make use of it, `config/application.properties` needs to be placed inside the build tool's output directory (`target` for Maven and `build/classes/java/main` for Gradle).\n+Keep in mind however that any cleaning operation from the build tool like `mvn clean` or `gradle clean` will remove the `config` directory as well.\n+\n+=== An application configuration file: `src/main/resources/application.properties`\n+\n+.Example `application.properties` file\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+greeting.message=hello <1>\n+quarkus.http.port=9090 <2>\n+----\n+<1> This is a user-defind configuration property.\n+<2> This is a configuration property consumed by `quarkus-vertx-http` extension.\n+\n+TIP: Quarkus supports the use of <<using_property_expressions,property expressions>> in the `application.properties` file.\n+\n+== Injecting configuration properties\n+\n+Quarkus uses https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config] annotations to inject the configuration properties in the application.\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.message\") <1>\n+String message;\n+----\n+<1> You can use `@Inject @ConfigProperty` or just `@ConfigProperty`.\n+The `@Inject` annotation is not necessary for members annotated with `@ConfigProperty`.\n+This behavior differs from https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config].\n+\n+NOTE: If the application attempts to inject a configuration property that is not set, an error is thrown, thus allowing you to quickly know when your configuration is complete.\n+\n+.More `@ConfigProperty` Examples\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.message\") <1>\n+String message;\n+\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.suffix\", defaultValue=\"!\") <2>\n+String suffix;\n+\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.name\")\n+Optional<String> name; <3>\n+----\n+<1> If you do not provide a value for this property, the application startup fails with `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.DeploymentException: No config value of type [class java.lang.String] exists for: greeting.message`.\n+<2> The default value is injected if the configuration does not provide a value for `greeting.suffix`.\n+<3> This property is optional - an empty `Optional` is injected if the configuration does not provide a value for `greeting.name`.\n+\n+== Programmatically access the configuration\n+\n+You can also access the configuration programmatically.\n+It can be handy to achieve dynamic lookup, or retrieve configured values from classes that are neither CDI beans or JAX-RS resources.\n+\n+You can access the configuration programmatically using `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.ConfigProvider.getConfig()` such as in:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+String databaseName = ConfigProvider.getConfig().getValue(\"database.name\", String.class);\n+Optional<String> maybeDatabaseName = ConfigProvider.getConfig().getOptionalValue(\"database.name\", String.class);\n+----\n+\n+[[using_configproperties]]\n+== Using @ConfigProperties\n+\n+As an alternative to injecting multiple related configuration values in the way that was shown in the previous example,\n+users can also use the `@io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties` annotation to group these properties together.\n+\n+For the greeting properties above, a `GreetingConfiguration` class could be created like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+package org.acme.config;\n+\n+import io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties;\n+import java.util.Optional;\n+\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\") <1>\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    private String message;\n+    private String suffix = \"!\"; <2>\n+    private Optional<String> name;\n+\n+    public String getMessage() {\n+        return message;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setMessage(String message) {\n+        this.message = message;\n+    }\n+\n+    public String getSuffix() {\n+        return suffix;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setSuffix(String suffix) {\n+        this.suffix = suffix;\n+    }\n+\n+    public Optional<String> getName() {\n+        return name;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setName(Optional<String> name) {\n+        this.name = name;\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+<1> `prefix` is optional. If not set then the prefix to be used will be determined by the class name. In this case it would still be `greeting` (since the `Configuration` suffix is removed). If the class were named `GreetingExtraConfiguration` then the resulting default prefix would be `greeting-extra`.\n+<2> `!` will be the default value if `greeting.suffix` is not set\n+\n+This class could then be injected into the `GreetingResource` using the familiar CDI `@Inject` annotation like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@Inject\n+GreetingConfiguration greetingConfiguration;\n+----\n+\n+Another alternative style provided by Quarkus is to create `GreetingConfiguration` as an interface like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+package org.acme.config;\n+\n+import io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties;\n+import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.inject.ConfigProperty;\n+import java.util.Optional;\n+\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public interface GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @ConfigProperty(name = \"message\") <1>\n+    String message();\n+\n+    @ConfigProperty(defaultValue = \"!\")\n+    String getSuffix(); <2>\n+\n+    Optional<String> getName(); <3>\n+}\n+----\n+<1> The `@ConfigProperty` annotation is needed because the name of the configuration property that the method corresponds to doesn't follow the getter method naming conventions\n+<2> In this case since `name` was not set, the corresponding property will be `greeting.suffix`.\n+<3> It is unnecessary to specify the `@ConfigProperty` annotation because the method name follows the getter method naming conventions (`greeting.name` being the corresponding property) and no default value is needed.\n+\n+When using `@ConfigProperties` on a class or an interface, if the value of one of its fields is not provided, the application startup will fail and a `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.DeploymentException` indicating the missing value information will be thrown.\n+This does not apply to `Optional` fields and fields with a default value.\n+\n+=== Additional notes on @ConfigProperties\n+\n+When using a regular class annotated with `@ConfigProperties` the class doesn't necessarily have to declare getters and setters.\n+Having simple public non-final fields is valid as well.\n+\n+Furthermore, the configuration classes support nested object configuration.

This can be overridden using the `quarkus.profile` system property.\n+\n+\n+[[using_property_expressions]]\n+== Using Property Expressions\n+\n+Quarkus supports the use of property expressions in the `application.properties` file.\n+\n+These expressions are resolved when the property is read.\n+So if your configuration property is a build time configuration property, the property expression will be resolved at build time.\n+If your configuration property is overridable at runtime, the property expression will be resolved at runtime.\n+\n+You can use property expressions both for the Quarkus configuration or for your own configuration properties.\n+\n+Property expressions are defined this way: `${my-property-expression}`.\n+\n+For example, having the following property:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+remote.host=quarkus.io\n+----\n+and another property defined as:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+callable.url=https://${remote.host}/\n+----\n+\n+will result in the value of the `callable.url` property being set to:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+callable.url=https://quarkus.io/\n+----\n+\n+Another example would be defining different database servers depending on the profile used:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+%dev.quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://remotehost:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+----\n+\n+can be simplified by having:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+%dev.application.server=localhost\n+application.server=remotehost\n+\n+quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://${application.server}:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+----\n+\n+It does result in one more line in this example but the value of `application.server` can be reused in other properties,\n+diminishing the possibility of typos and providing more flexibility in property definitions.\n+\n+\n+[#combine-property-env-var]\n+== Combining Property Expressions and Environment Variables\n+\n+Quarkus also supports the combination of both property expressions and environment variables.\n+\n+Let's assume you have following property defined in `application.properties`:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+remote.host=quarkus.io\n+----\n+\n+You can combine environment variables and property expressions by having a property defined as follows:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+application.host=${HOST:${remote.host}}\n+----\n+\n+This will expand the `HOST` environment variable and use the value of the property `remote.host` as the default value if `HOST` is not set.\n+\n+For the purpose of this section we used the property `remote.host` we defined previously.\n+It has to be noted that the value could have been a fixed one such as in:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+application.host=${HOST:localhost}\n+----\n+\n+which will result in `localhost` as the default value if `HOST` is not set.\n+\n+[[configuring_quarkus]]\n+== Configuring Quarkus\n+\n+Quarkus itself is configured via the same mechanism as your application. Quarkus reserves the `quarkus.` namespace\n+for its own configuration. For example to configure the HTTP server port you can set `quarkus.http.port` in\n+`application.properties`. All the Quarkus configuration properties are link:all-config[documented and searchable].\n+\n+[IMPORTANT]\n+====\n+As mentioned above, properties prefixed with `quarkus.` are effectively reserved for configuring Quarkus itself and\n+therefore `quarkus.` should **never** be used as prefix for application specific properties.\n+\n+In the previous examples using `quarkus.message` instead of `greeting.message` would result in unexpected behavior.\n+====\n+\n+Quarkus does much of its configuration and bootstrap at build time and most configuration properties are read and used during the build.\n+These properties are _fixed at build time_ and it's not possible to change them at runtime.\n+You always need to repackage your application in order to reflect changes of such properties.\n+\n+TIP: The properties fixed at build time are marked with a lock icon (icon:lock[]) in the link:all-config[list of all configuration options].\n+\n+However, some extensions do define properties _overridable at runtime_.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyNzY4NzAyNA=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "9f71aede594314e5030837e8e9bd979d87c5d332"}, "originalPosition": 476}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMzMwODY4OTUzOnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "docs/src/main/asciidoc/config.adoc", "isResolved": true, "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0yMFQxMzozMToxN1rOH3PvQA==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0yMFQxMzozMToxN1rOH3PvQA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyNzY5MTU4NA==", "bodyText": "This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

To do this, run:\n+TIP: The properties fixed at build time are marked with a lock icon (icon:lock[]) in the link:all-config[list of all configuration options].\n \n-[source,bash]\n---\n-./mvnw quarkus:generate-config\n---\n-\n-This will create a `src/main/resources/application.properties.example` file that contains all the config options\n-exposed via the extensions you currently have installed. These options are commented out, and have their default value\n-when applicable. For example this HTTP port config entry will appear as:\n-\n-\n-[source,properties]\n---\n-#\n-# The HTTP port\n-#\n-#quarkus.http.port=8080\n---\n-\n-Rather than generating an example config file, you can also add these to you actual config file by setting the `-Dfile`\n-parameter:\n-\n-[source,bash]\n---\n-./mvnw quarkus:generate-config -Dfile=application.properties\n---\n-\n-If a config option is already present (commented or not) it will not be added, so it is safe to run this after\n-adding an additional extension to see what additional options have been added.\n-\n-== Overriding properties at runtime\n-\n-Quarkus does much of its configuration and bootstrap at build time.\n-Most properties will then be read and set during the build time step.\n-To change them, make sure to repackage your application.\n-\n-[source,bash]\n---\n-./mvnw clean package\n---\n-\n-Extensions do define _some_ properties as overridable at runtime.\n+However, some extensions do define properties _overridable at runtime_.\n A canonical example is the database URL, username and password which is only known specifically in your target environment.\n-This is a tradeoff as the more runtime properties are available, the less build time prework Quarkus can do. The list of runtime properties is therefore lean.\n-\n-You can override these runtime properties with the following mechanisms (in decreasing priority):\n-\n-1. using system properties:\n-  * for a runner jar: `java -Dquarkus.datasource.password=youshallnotpass -jar target/myapp-runner.jar`\n-  * for a native executable: `./target/myapp-runner -Dquarkus.datasource.password=youshallnotpass`\n-2. using environment variables:\n-  * for a runner jar: `export QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=youshallnotpass ; java -jar target/myapp-runner.jar`\n-  * for a native executable: `export QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=youshallnotpass ; ./target/myapp-runner`\n-3. using an environment file named `.env` placed in the current working directory containing the line `QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=youshallnotpass` (for dev mode, this file can be placed in the root of the project, but it is advised to not check it in to version control)\n-4. using a configuration file placed in `$PWD/config/application.properties`\n-  * By placing an `application.properties` file inside a directory named `config` which resides in the directory where the application runs, any runtime properties defined\n-in that file will override the default configuration. Furthermore any runtime properties added to this file that were not part of the original `application.properties` file\n-_will also_ be taken into account.\n-  * This works in the same way for runner jar and the native executable\n-\n-NOTE: Environment variables names are following the conversion rules of link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/blob/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/configsources.asciidoc#default-configsources[Eclipse MicroProfile]\n-\n-NOTE: Environment variables without a configuration profile defined in `.env` file will overwrite all its related profiles in `application.properties`, e.g. `%test.application.value` is overwritten by `APPLICATION_VALUE` in `.env` file.\n-\n-NOTE: The `config/application.properties` features is available in development mode as well. To make use of it, `config/application.properties` needs to be placed inside the build tool's output directory (`target` for Maven and `build/classes/java/main` for Gradle).\n-Keep in mind however that any cleaning operation from the build tool like `mvn clean` or `gradle clean` will remove the `config` directory as well.\n-\n-=== Configuration Profiles\n-\n-Quarkus supports the notion of configuration profiles. These allow you to have multiple configuration in the same file and\n-select between them via a profile name.\n-\n-The syntax for this is `%{profile}.config.key=value`. For example if I have the following:\n-\n-[source,properties]\n-----\n-quarkus.http.port=9090\n-%dev.quarkus.http.port=8181\n-----\n-\n-The Quarkus HTTP port will be 9090, unless the `dev` profile is active, in which case it will be 8181.\n-\n-To use profiles in the `.env` file, you can follow a `_{PROFILE}_CONFIG_KEY=value` pattern. An equivalent of the above example in an `.env` file would be:\n-\n-[source,.env]\n-----\n-QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=9090\n-_DEV_QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=8181\n-----\n-\n-By default Quarkus has three profiles, although it is possible to use as many as you like. The default profiles are:\n-\n-* *dev* - Activated when in development mode (i.e. `quarkus:dev`)\n-* *test* - Activated when running tests\n-* *prod* - The default profile when not running in development or test mode\n-\n-There are two ways to set a custom profile, either via the `quarkus.profile` system property or the `QUARKUS_PROFILE`\n-environment variable. If both are set the system property takes precedence. Note that it is not necessary to\n-define the names of these profiles anywhere, all that is necessary is to create a config property with the profile\n-name, and then set the current profile to that name. For example if I want a `staging` profile with a different HTTP port\n-I can add the following to `application.properties`:\n-\n-[source,properties]\n-----\n-quarkus.http.port=9090\n-%staging.quarkus.http.port=9999\n-----\n-\n-And then set the `QUARKUS_PROFILE` environment variable to `staging` to activate my profile.\n-\n-[NOTE]\n-====\n-The proper way to check the active profile programmatically is to use the `getActiveProfile` method of `io.quarkus.runtime.configuration.ProfileManager`.\n-\n-Using `@ConfigProperty(\"quarkus.profile\")` will *not* work properly.\n-====\n-\n-=== Using Property Expressions\n-\n-Quarkus supports the use of property expressions in the `application.properties` file.\n-\n-These expressions are resolved when the property is read.\n-So if your configuration property is a build time configuration property, the property expression will be resolved at build time.\n-If your configuration property is overridable at runtime, the property expression will be resolved at runtime.\n-\n-You can use property expressions both for the Quarkus configuration or for your own configuration properties.\n-\n-Property expressions are defined this way: `${my-property-expression}`.\n-\n-For example, having the following property:\n-\n-[source,properties]\n-----\n-remote.host=quarkus.io\n-----\n-and another property defined as:\n-\n-[source,properties]\n-----\n-callable.url=https://${remote.host}/\n-----\n-\n-will result in the value of the `callable.url` property being set to:\n-\n-[source,properties]\n-----\n-callable.url=https://quarkus.io/\n-----\n-\n-Another example would be defining different database servers depending on the profile used:\n-\n-[source,properties]\n-----\n-%dev.quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n-quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://remotehost:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n-----\n-\n-can be simplified by having:\n-\n-[source,properties]\n-----\n-%dev.application.server=localhost\n-application.server=remotehost\n-\n-quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://${application.server}:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n-----\n-\n-It does result in one more line in this example but the value of `application.server` can be reused in other properties,\n-diminishing the possibility of typos and providing more flexibility in property definitions.\n-\n-[#combine-property-env-var]\n-=== Combining Property Expressions and Environment Variables\n-\n-Quarkus also supports the combination of both property expressions and environment variables.\n-\n-Let's assume you have following property defined in `application.properties`:\n-\n-[source,properties]\n-----\n-remote.host=quarkus.io\n-----\n-\n-You can combine environment variables and property expressions by having a property defined as follows:\n-\n-[source,properties]\n-----\n-application.host=${HOST:${remote.host}}\n-----\n-\n-This will expand the `HOST` environment variable and use the value of the property `remote.host` as the default value if `HOST` is not set.\n-\n-For the purpose of this section we used the property `remote.host` we defined previously.\n-It has to be noted that the value could have been a fixed one such as in:\n-\n-[source,properties]\n-----\n-application.host=${HOST:localhost}\n-----\n-\n-which will result in `localhost` as the default value if `HOST` is not set.\n-\n-=== Clearing properties\n-\n-Run time properties which are optional, and which have had values set at build time or which have a default value,\n-may be explicitly cleared by assigning an empty string to the property.  Note that this will _only_ affect\n-run time properties, and will _only_ work with properties whose values are not required.\n-\n-The property may be cleared by setting the corresponding `application.properties` property, setting the\n-corresponding system property, or setting the corresponding environment variable.\n-\n-==== Miscellaneous\n-The default Quarkus application runtime profile is set to the profile used to build the application.\n-For example:\n-[source,bash]\n-----\n-./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.profile=prod-aws\n-./target/my-app-1.0-runner // <1>\n-----\n-<1> The command will run with the `prod-aws` profile. This can be overridden using the `quarkus.profile` system property.\n-\n-== Custom Configuration\n-\n-=== Custom configuration sources\n-\n-You can also introduce custom configuration sources in the standard MicroProfile Config manner.  To\n-do this, you must provide a class which implements either `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.ConfigSource`\n-or `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.ConfigSourceProvider`.  Create a\n-https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html[service file] for the\n-class and it will be detected and installed at application startup.\n-\n-=== Custom configuration converters\n-\n-You can also use your custom types as a configuration values. This can be done by implementing `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter<T>`\n-and adding its fully qualified class name in the `META-INF/services/org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter` file.\n-\n-Let us assume you have a custom type like this one:\n-\n-[source,java]\n-----\n-package org.acme.config;\n-\n-public class MicroProfileCustomValue {\n-\n-    private final int number;\n-\n-    public MicroProfileCustomValue(int number) {\n-        this.number = number;\n-    }\n-\n-    public int getNumber() {\n-        return number;\n-    }\n-}\n-----\n-\n-The corresponding converter will look like the one below. Please note that your custom converter class must be `public` and must have\n-a `public` no-argument constructor. It also must not be `abstract`.\n-\n-\n-[source,java]\n-----\n-package org.acme.config;\n-\n-import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter;\n-\n-public class MicroProfileCustomValueConverter implements Converter<MicroProfileCustomValue> {\n-\n-    @Override\n-    public MicroProfileCustomValue convert(String value) {\n-        return new MicroProfileCustomValue(Integer.valueOf(value));\n-    }\n-}\n-----\n-\n-Then you need to include the fully qualified class name of the converter in a service file `META-INF/services/org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter`.\n-If you have more converters, simply add their class names in this file as well. Single fully qualified class name per line, for example:\n-\n-[source]\n-----\n-org.acme.config.MicroProfileCustomValueConverter\n-org.acme.config.SomeOtherConverter\n-org.acme.config.YetAnotherConverter\n-----\n-\n-Please note that `SomeOtherConverter` and `YetAnotherConverter` were added just for a demonstration. If you include in this file classes\n-which are not available at runtime, the converters loading will fail.\n-\n-After this is done you can use your custom type as a configuration value:\n-\n-[source,java]\n-----\n-@ConfigProperty(name = \"configuration.value.name\")\n-MicroProfileCustomValue value;\n-----\n-\n-==== Converter priority\n-\n-In some cases, you may want to use a custom converter to convert a type which is already converted\n-by a different converter. In such cases, you can use the `javax.annotation.Priority` annotation to\n-change converters precedence and make your custom converter of higher priority than the other\n-on the list.\n-\n-By default, if no `@Priority` can be found on a converter, it's registered with a priority of 100\n-and all Quarkus core converters are registered with a priority of 200, so depending on which\n-converter you would like to replace, you need to set a higher value.\n-\n-To demonstrate the idea let us implement a custom converter which will take precedence over\n-`MicroProfileCustomValueConverter` implemented in the previous example.\n-\n-[source,java]\n-----\n-package org.acme.config;\n-\n-import javax.annotation.Priority;\n-import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter;\n-\n-@Priority(150)\n-public class MyCustomConverter implements Converter<MicroProfileCustomValue> {\n-\n-    @Override\n-    public MicroProfileCustomValue convert(String value) {\n-\n-        final int secretNumber;\n-        if (value.startsFrom(\"OBF:\")) {\n-            secretNumber = Integer.valueOf(SecretDecoder.decode(value));\n-        } else {\n-            secretNumber = Integer.valueOf(value);\n-        }\n-\n-        return new MicroProfileCustomValue(secretNumber);\n-    }\n-}\n-----\n-\n-Since it converts the same value type (namely `MicroProfileCustomValue`) and has a priority\n-of 150, it will be used instead of a `MicroProfileCustomValueConverter` which has a default\n-priority of 100.\n-\n-NOTE: This new converter also needs to be listed in a service file, i.e. `META-INF/services/org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter`.\n-\n-[[yaml]]\n-== YAML for Configuration\n-\n-=== Add YAML Config Support\n-\n-You might want to use YAML over properties for configuration.\n-Since link:https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-config[SmallRye Config] brings support for YAML\n-configuration, Quarkus supports this as well.\n-\n-First you will need to add the YAML extension to your `pom.xml`:\n-\n-[source,xml]\n-----\n-<dependency>\n-    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>\n-    <artifactId>quarkus-config-yaml</artifactId>\n-</dependency>\n-----\n-\n-Or you can alternatively run this command in the directory containing your Quarkus project:\n-\n-[source,bash]\n-----\n-./mvnw quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions=\"config-yaml\"\n-----\n-\n-Now Quarkus can read YAML configuration files.\n-The config directories and priorities are the same as before.\n-\n-NOTE: Quarkus will choose an `application.yaml` over an `application.properties`.\n-YAML files are just an alternative way to configure your application.\n-You should decide and keep one configuration type to avoid errors.\n-\n-==== Configuration Examples\n-[source,yaml]\n-----\n-# YAML supports comments\n-quarkus:\n-  datasource:\n-    db-kind: postgresql\n-    jdbc:\n-      url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/some-database\n-    username: quarkus\n-    password: quarkus\n-\n-# REST Client configuration property\n-org:\n-  acme:\n-    restclient:\n-      CountriesService/mp-rest/url: https://restcountries.eu/rest\n-\n-# For configuration property names that use quotes, do not split the string inside the quotes.\n-quarkus:\n-  log:\n-    category:\n-      \"io.quarkus.category\":\n-        level: INFO\n-----\n-\n-[NOTE]\n-====\n-Quarkus also supports using `application.yml` as the name of the YAML file.

To make use of it, `config/application.properties` needs to be placed inside the build tool's output directory (`target` for Maven and `build/classes/java/main` for Gradle).\n+Keep in mind however that any cleaning operation from the build tool like `mvn clean` or `gradle clean` will remove the `config` directory as well.\n+\n+[[application_properties_file]]\n+=== An application configuration file\n+\n+This is the main application configuration file located in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.\n+\n+.Example `application.properties` file\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+greeting.message=hello <1>\n+quarkus.http.port=9090 <2>\n+----\n+<1> This is a user-defind configuration property.\n+<2> This is a configuration property consumed by the `quarkus-vertx-http` extension.\n+\n+TIP: Quarkus supports the use of <<using_property_expressions,property expressions>> in the `application.properties` file.\n+\n+== Injecting configuration properties\n+\n+Quarkus uses https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config] annotations to inject the configuration properties in the application.\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.message\") <1>\n+String message;\n+----\n+<1> You can use `@Inject @ConfigProperty` or just `@ConfigProperty`.\n+The `@Inject` annotation is not necessary for members annotated with `@ConfigProperty`.\n+This behavior differs from https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config].\n+\n+NOTE: If the application attempts to inject a configuration property that is not set, an error is thrown, thus allowing you to quickly know when your configuration is complete.\n+\n+.More `@ConfigProperty` Examples\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.message\") <1>\n+String message;\n+\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.suffix\", defaultValue=\"!\") <2>\n+String suffix;\n+\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.name\")\n+Optional<String> name; <3>\n+----\n+<1> If you do not provide a value for this property, the application startup fails with `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.DeploymentException: No config value of type [class java.lang.String] exists for: greeting.message`.\n+<2> The default value is injected if the configuration does not provide a value for `greeting.suffix`.\n+<3> This property is optional - an empty `Optional` is injected if the configuration does not provide a value for `greeting.name`.\n+\n+== Programmatically access the configuration\n+\n+You can also access the configuration programmatically.\n+It can be handy to achieve dynamic lookup, or retrieve configured values from classes that are neither CDI beans or JAX-RS resources.\n+\n+You can access the configuration programmatically using `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.ConfigProvider.getConfig()` such as in:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+String databaseName = ConfigProvider.getConfig().getValue(\"database.name\", String.class);\n+Optional<String> maybeDatabaseName = ConfigProvider.getConfig().getOptionalValue(\"database.name\", String.class);\n+----\n+\n+[[using_configproperties]]\n+== Using @ConfigProperties\n+\n+As an alternative to injecting multiple related configuration values in the way that was shown in the previous example,\n+users can also use the `@io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties` annotation to group these properties together.\n+\n+For the greeting properties above, a `GreetingConfiguration` class could be created like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+package org.acme.config;\n+\n+import io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties;\n+import java.util.Optional;\n+\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\") <1>\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    private String message;\n+    private String suffix = \"!\"; <2>\n+    private Optional<String> name;\n+\n+    public String getMessage() {\n+        return message;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setMessage(String message) {\n+        this.message = message;\n+    }\n+\n+    public String getSuffix() {\n+        return suffix;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setSuffix(String suffix) {\n+        this.suffix = suffix;\n+    }\n+\n+    public Optional<String> getName() {\n+        return name;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setName(Optional<String> name) {\n+        this.name = name;\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+<1> `prefix` is optional. If not set then the prefix to be used will be determined by the class name. In this case it would still be `greeting` (since the `Configuration` suffix is removed).

Suppose there was a need to have an extra layer\n+of greeting configuration named `content` that would contain a few fields. This could be achieved like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+    public Optional<String> name;\n+    public ContentConfig content; <1>\n+\n+    public static class ContentConfig {\n+        public Integer prizeAmount;\n+        public List<String> recipients;\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+<1> The name of the field (not the class name) will determine the name of the properties that are bound to the object.\n+\n+Setting the properties would occur in the normal manner, for example in `application.properties` one could have:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+greeting.message = hello\n+greeting.name = quarkus\n+greeting.content.prize-amount=10\n+greeting.content.recipients=Jane,John\n+----\n+\n+Furthermore, classes annotated with `@ConfigProperties` can be annotated with Bean Validation annotations similar to the following example:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @Size(min = 20)\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+\n+}\n+----\n+\n+WARNING: For validation to work, the `quarkus-hibernate-validator` extension needs to be present.\n+\n+If the validation fails with the given configuration, the application will fail to start and indicate the corresponding validation errors in the log.\n+\n+In the case of an interface being annotated with `@ConfigProperties`, the interface is allowed to extend other interfaces and methods from\n+the entire interface hierarchy are used to bind properties.\n+\n+=== Using same ConfigProperties with different prefixes\n+\n+Quarkus also supports the use of the same `@ConfigProperties` object with different prefixes for each injection point using the `io.quarkus.arc.config.@ConfigPrefix` annotation.\n+Say for example that `GreetingConfiguration` from above needs to be used for both the `greeting` prefix and the `other` prefix.\n+In that case the code would look like so:\n+\n+`GreetingConfiguration.java`\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @Size(min = 20)\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+\n+}\n+----\n+\n+`SomeBean.java`\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ApplicationScoped\n+public class SomeBean {\n+\n+    @Inject <1>\n+    GreetingConfiguration greetingConfiguration;\n+\n+    @ConfigPrefix(\"other\") <2>\n+    GreetingConfiguration otherConfiguration;\n+\n+}\n+----\n+<1> At this injection point `greetingConfiguration` will use the `greeting` prefix since that is what has been defined on `@ConfigProperties`.\n+<2> At this injection point `otherConfiguration` will use the `other` prefix from `@ConfigPrefix` instead of the `greeting` prefix. Notice that in this case `@Inject` is not required.\n+\n+[[configuration_profiles]]\n+== Configuration Profiles\n+\n+Quarkus supports the notion of configuration profiles. \n+These allow you to have multiple configurations in the same file and select between them via a profile name.\n+\n+The syntax for this is `%{profile}.config.key=value`. For example if I have the following:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+quarkus.http.port=9090\n+%dev.quarkus.http.port=8181\n+----\n+\n+The Quarkus HTTP port will be 9090, unless the `dev` profile is active, in which case it will be 8181.\n+\n+To use profiles in the `.env` file, you can follow a `_{PROFILE}_CONFIG_KEY=value` pattern. An equivalent of the above example in an `.env` file would be:\n+\n+[source,.env]\n+----\n+QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=9090\n+_DEV_QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=8181\n+----\n+\n+By default Quarkus has three profiles, although it is possible to use as many as you like.

To make use of it, `config/application.properties` needs to be placed inside the build tool's output directory (`target` for Maven and `build/classes/java/main` for Gradle).\n+Keep in mind however that any cleaning operation from the build tool like `mvn clean` or `gradle clean` will remove the `config` directory as well.\n+\n+[[application_properties_file]]\n+=== An application configuration file\n+\n+This is the main application configuration file located in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.\n+\n+.Example `application.properties` file\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+greeting.message=hello <1>\n+quarkus.http.port=9090 <2>\n+----\n+<1> This is a user-defind configuration property.\n+<2> This is a configuration property consumed by the `quarkus-vertx-http` extension.\n+\n+TIP: Quarkus supports the use of <<using_property_expressions,property expressions>> in the `application.properties` file.\n+\n+== Injecting configuration properties\n+\n+Quarkus uses https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config] annotations to inject the configuration properties in the application.\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.message\") <1>\n+String message;\n+----\n+<1> You can use `@Inject @ConfigProperty` or just `@ConfigProperty`.\n+The `@Inject` annotation is not necessary for members annotated with `@ConfigProperty`.\n+This behavior differs from https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config].\n+\n+NOTE: If the application attempts to inject a configuration property that is not set, an error is thrown, thus allowing you to quickly know when your configuration is complete.\n+\n+.More `@ConfigProperty` Examples\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.message\") <1>\n+String message;\n+\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.suffix\", defaultValue=\"!\") <2>\n+String suffix;\n+\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.name\")\n+Optional<String> name; <3>\n+----\n+<1> If you do not provide a value for this property, the application startup fails with `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.DeploymentException: No config value of type [class java.lang.String] exists for: greeting.message`.\n+<2> The default value is injected if the configuration does not provide a value for `greeting.suffix`.\n+<3> This property is optional - an empty `Optional` is injected if the configuration does not provide a value for `greeting.name`.\n+\n+== Programmatically access the configuration\n+\n+You can also access the configuration programmatically.\n+It can be handy to achieve dynamic lookup, or retrieve configured values from classes that are neither CDI beans or JAX-RS resources.\n+\n+You can access the configuration programmatically using `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.ConfigProvider.getConfig()` such as in:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+String databaseName = ConfigProvider.getConfig().getValue(\"database.name\", String.class);\n+Optional<String> maybeDatabaseName = ConfigProvider.getConfig().getOptionalValue(\"database.name\", String.class);\n+----\n+\n+[[using_configproperties]]\n+== Using @ConfigProperties\n+\n+As an alternative to injecting multiple related configuration values in the way that was shown in the previous example,\n+users can also use the `@io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties` annotation to group these properties together.\n+\n+For the greeting properties above, a `GreetingConfiguration` class could be created like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+package org.acme.config;\n+\n+import io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties;\n+import java.util.Optional;\n+\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\") <1>\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    private String message;\n+    private String suffix = \"!\"; <2>\n+    private Optional<String> name;\n+\n+    public String getMessage() {\n+        return message;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setMessage(String message) {\n+        this.message = message;\n+    }\n+\n+    public String getSuffix() {\n+        return suffix;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setSuffix(String suffix) {\n+        this.suffix = suffix;\n+    }\n+\n+    public Optional<String> getName() {\n+        return name;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setName(Optional<String> name) {\n+        this.name = name;\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+<1> `prefix` is optional. If not set then the prefix to be used will be determined by the class name. In this case it would still be `greeting` (since the `Configuration` suffix is removed). If the class were named `GreetingExtraConfiguration` then the resulting default prefix would be `greeting-extra`.\n+<2> `!` will be the default value if `greeting.suffix` is not set\n+\n+This class could then be injected into the `GreetingResource` using the familiar CDI `@Inject` annotation like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@Inject\n+GreetingConfiguration greetingConfiguration;\n+----\n+\n+Another alternative style provided by Quarkus is to create `GreetingConfiguration` as an interface like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+package org.acme.config;\n+\n+import io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties;\n+import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.inject.ConfigProperty;\n+import java.util.Optional;\n+\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public interface GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @ConfigProperty(name = \"message\") <1>\n+    String message();\n+\n+    @ConfigProperty(defaultValue = \"!\")\n+    String getSuffix(); <2>\n+\n+    Optional<String> getName(); <3>\n+}\n+----\n+<1> The `@ConfigProperty` annotation is needed because the name of the configuration property that the method corresponds to doesn't follow the getter method naming conventions\n+<2> In this case since `name` was not set, the corresponding property will be `greeting.suffix`.\n+<3> It is unnecessary to specify the `@ConfigProperty` annotation because the method name follows the getter method naming conventions (`greeting.name` being the corresponding property) and no default value is needed.\n+\n+When using `@ConfigProperties` on a class or an interface, if the value of one of its fields is not provided, the application startup will fail and a `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.DeploymentException` indicating the missing value information will be thrown.\n+This does not apply to `Optional` fields and fields with a default value.\n+\n+=== Additional notes on @ConfigProperties\n+\n+When using a regular class annotated with `@ConfigProperties` the class doesn't necessarily have to declare getters and setters.\n+Having simple public non-final fields is valid as well.\n+\n+Furthermore, the configuration classes support nested object configuration. Suppose there was a need to have an extra layer\n+of greeting configuration named `content` that would contain a few fields. This could be achieved like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+    public Optional<String> name;\n+    public ContentConfig content; <1>\n+\n+    public static class ContentConfig {\n+        public Integer prizeAmount;\n+        public List<String> recipients;\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+<1> The name of the field (not the class name) will determine the name of the properties that are bound to the object.\n+\n+Setting the properties would occur in the normal manner, for example in `application.properties` one could have:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+greeting.message = hello\n+greeting.name = quarkus\n+greeting.content.prize-amount=10\n+greeting.content.recipients=Jane,John\n+----\n+\n+Furthermore, classes annotated with `@ConfigProperties` can be annotated with Bean Validation annotations similar to the following example:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @Size(min = 20)\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+\n+}\n+----\n+\n+WARNING: For validation to work, the `quarkus-hibernate-validator` extension needs to be present.\n+\n+If the validation fails with the given configuration, the application will fail to start and indicate the corresponding validation errors in the log.\n+\n+In the case of an interface being annotated with `@ConfigProperties`, the interface is allowed to extend other interfaces and methods from\n+the entire interface hierarchy are used to bind properties.\n+\n+=== Using same ConfigProperties with different prefixes\n+\n+Quarkus also supports the use of the same `@ConfigProperties` object with different prefixes for each injection point using the `io.quarkus.arc.config.@ConfigPrefix` annotation.\n+Say for example that `GreetingConfiguration` from above needs to be used for both the `greeting` prefix and the `other` prefix.\n+In that case the code would look like so:\n+\n+`GreetingConfiguration.java`\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @Size(min = 20)\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+\n+}\n+----\n+\n+`SomeBean.java`\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ApplicationScoped\n+public class SomeBean {\n+\n+    @Inject <1>\n+    GreetingConfiguration greetingConfiguration;\n+\n+    @ConfigPrefix(\"other\") <2>\n+    GreetingConfiguration otherConfiguration;\n+\n+}\n+----\n+<1> At this injection point `greetingConfiguration` will use the `greeting` prefix since that is what has been defined on `@ConfigProperties`.\n+<2> At this injection point `otherConfiguration` will use the `other` prefix from `@ConfigPrefix` instead of the `greeting` prefix. Notice that in this case `@Inject` is not required.\n+\n+[[configuration_profiles]]\n+== Configuration Profiles\n+\n+Quarkus supports the notion of configuration profiles. \n+These allow you to have multiple configurations in the same file and select between them via a profile name.\n+\n+The syntax for this is `%{profile}.config.key=value`. For example if I have the following:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+quarkus.http.port=9090\n+%dev.quarkus.http.port=8181\n+----\n+\n+The Quarkus HTTP port will be 9090, unless the `dev` profile is active, in which case it will be 8181.\n+\n+To use profiles in the `.env` file, you can follow a `_{PROFILE}_CONFIG_KEY=value` pattern. An equivalent of the above example in an `.env` file would be:\n+\n+[source,.env]\n+----\n+QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=9090\n+_DEV_QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=8181\n+----\n+\n+By default Quarkus has three profiles, although it is possible to use as many as you like. \n+The default profiles are:\n+\n+* *dev* - Activated when in development mode (i.e. `quarkus:dev`)\n+* *test* - Activated when running tests\n+* *prod* - The default profile when not running in development or test mode\n+\n+There are two ways to set a custom profile, either via the `quarkus.profile` system property or the `QUARKUS_PROFILE`\n+environment variable. If both are set the system property takes precedence. Note that it is not necessary to\n+define the names of these profiles anywhere, all that is necessary is to create a config property with the profile\n+name, and then set the current profile to that name. For example if I want a `staging` profile with a different HTTP port I can add the following to `application.properties`:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+quarkus.http.port=9090\n+%staging.quarkus.http.port=9999\n+----\n+\n+And then set the `QUARKUS_PROFILE` environment variable to `staging` to activate my profile.\n+\n+[NOTE]\n+====\n+The proper way to check the active profile programmatically is to use the `getActiveProfile` method of `io.quarkus.runtime.configuration.ProfileManager`.\n+\n+Using `@ConfigProperty(\"quarkus.profile\")` will *not* work properly.\n+====\n+\n+=== Default Runtime Profile\n+\n+The default Quarkus application runtime profile is set to the profile used to build the application.\n+For example:\n+[source,bash]\n+----\n+./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.profile=prod-aws\n+./target/my-app-1.0-runner // <1>\n+----\n+<1> The command will run with the `prod-aws` profile. This can be overridden using the `quarkus.profile` system property.\n+\n+\n+[[using_property_expressions]]\n+== Using Property Expressions\n+\n+Quarkus supports the use of property expressions in the `application.properties` file.\n+\n+These expressions are resolved when the property is read.\n+So if your configuration property is a build time configuration property, the property expression will be resolved at build time.\n+If your configuration property is overridable at runtime, the property expression will be resolved at runtime.\n+\n+You can use property expressions both for the Quarkus configuration or for your own configuration properties.\n+\n+Property expressions are defined this way: `${my-property-expression}`.\n+\n+For example, having the following property:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+remote.host=quarkus.io\n+----\n+and another property defined as:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+callable.url=https://${remote.host}/\n+----\n+\n+will result in the value of the `callable.url` property being set to:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+callable.url=https://quarkus.io/\n+----\n+\n+Another example would be defining different database servers depending on the profile used:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+%dev.quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://remotehost:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+----\n+\n+can be simplified by having:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+%dev.application.server=localhost\n+application.server=remotehost\n+\n+quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://${application.server}:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+----\n+\n+It does result in one more line in this example but the value of `application.server` can be reused in other properties,\n+diminishing the possibility of typos and providing more flexibility in property definitions.\n+\n+\n+[#combine-property-env-var]\n+== Combining Property Expressions and Environment Variables\n+\n+Quarkus also supports the combination of both property expressions and environment variables.\n+\n+Let's assume you have following property defined in `application.properties`:", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "8db2a006915902929439f7b14ff4b7c998e5fd1c"}, "originalPosition": 436}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMzMxMzQxMzQ2OnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "docs/src/main/asciidoc/config-reference.adoc", "isResolved": true, "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0yMlQxNzoxMzozNFrOH34zrA==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0yMlQxNzoxMzozNFrOH34zrA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyODM2NDQ2MA==", "bodyText": "This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

To make use of it, `config/application.properties` needs to be placed inside the build tool's output directory (`target` for Maven and `build/classes/java/main` for Gradle).\n+Keep in mind however that any cleaning operation from the build tool like `mvn clean` or `gradle clean` will remove the `config` directory as well.\n+\n+[[application_properties_file]]\n+=== An application configuration file\n+\n+This is the main application configuration file located in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.\n+\n+.Example `application.properties` file\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+greeting.message=hello <1>\n+quarkus.http.port=9090 <2>\n+----\n+<1> This is a user-defind configuration property.\n+<2> This is a configuration property consumed by the `quarkus-vertx-http` extension.\n+\n+TIP: Quarkus supports the use of <<using_property_expressions,property expressions>> in the `application.properties` file.\n+\n+== Injecting configuration properties\n+\n+Quarkus uses https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config] annotations to inject the configuration properties in the application.\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.message\") <1>\n+String message;\n+----\n+<1> You can use `@Inject @ConfigProperty` or just `@ConfigProperty`.\n+The `@Inject` annotation is not necessary for members annotated with `@ConfigProperty`.\n+This behavior differs from https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config].\n+\n+NOTE: If the application attempts to inject a configuration property that is not set, an error is thrown, thus allowing you to quickly know when your configuration is complete.\n+\n+.More `@ConfigProperty` Examples\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.message\") <1>\n+String message;\n+\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.suffix\", defaultValue=\"!\") <2>\n+String suffix;\n+\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.name\")\n+Optional<String> name; <3>\n+----\n+<1> If you do not provide a value for this property, the application startup fails with `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.DeploymentException: No config value of type [class java.lang.String] exists for: greeting.message`.\n+<2> The default value is injected if the configuration does not provide a value for `greeting.suffix`.\n+<3> This property is optional - an empty `Optional` is injected if the configuration does not provide a value for `greeting.name`.\n+\n+== Programmatically access the configuration\n+\n+You can also access the configuration programmatically.\n+It can be handy to achieve dynamic lookup, or retrieve configured values from classes that are neither CDI beans or JAX-RS resources.\n+\n+You can access the configuration programmatically using `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.ConfigProvider.getConfig()` such as in:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+String databaseName = ConfigProvider.getConfig().getValue(\"database.name\", String.class);\n+Optional<String> maybeDatabaseName = ConfigProvider.getConfig().getOptionalValue(\"database.name\", String.class);\n+----\n+\n+[[using_configproperties]]\n+== Using @ConfigProperties\n+\n+As an alternative to injecting multiple related configuration values in the way that was shown in the previous example,\n+users can also use the `@io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties` annotation to group these properties together.\n+\n+For the greeting properties above, a `GreetingConfiguration` class could be created like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+package org.acme.config;\n+\n+import io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties;\n+import java.util.Optional;\n+\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\") <1>\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    private String message;\n+    private String suffix = \"!\"; <2>\n+    private Optional<String> name;\n+\n+    public String getMessage() {\n+        return message;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setMessage(String message) {\n+        this.message = message;\n+    }\n+\n+    public String getSuffix() {\n+        return suffix;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setSuffix(String suffix) {\n+        this.suffix = suffix;\n+    }\n+\n+    public Optional<String> getName() {\n+        return name;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setName(Optional<String> name) {\n+        this.name = name;\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+<1> `prefix` is optional. If not set then the prefix to be used will be determined by the class name. In this case it would still be `greeting` (since the `Configuration` suffix is removed). If the class were named `GreetingExtraConfiguration` then the resulting default prefix would be `greeting-extra`.\n+<2> `!` will be the default value if `greeting.suffix` is not set\n+\n+This class could then be injected into the `GreetingResource` using the familiar CDI `@Inject` annotation like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@Inject\n+GreetingConfiguration greetingConfiguration;\n+----\n+\n+Another alternative style provided by Quarkus is to create `GreetingConfiguration` as an interface like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+package org.acme.config;\n+\n+import io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties;\n+import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.inject.ConfigProperty;\n+import java.util.Optional;\n+\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public interface GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @ConfigProperty(name = \"message\") <1>\n+    String message();\n+\n+    @ConfigProperty(defaultValue = \"!\")\n+    String getSuffix(); <2>\n+\n+    Optional<String> getName(); <3>\n+}\n+----\n+<1> The `@ConfigProperty` annotation is needed because the name of the configuration property that the method corresponds to doesn't follow the getter method naming conventions\n+<2> In this case since `name` was not set, the corresponding property will be `greeting.suffix`.\n+<3> It is unnecessary to specify the `@ConfigProperty` annotation because the method name follows the getter method naming conventions (`greeting.name` being the corresponding property) and no default value is needed.\n+\n+When using `@ConfigProperties` on a class or an interface, if the value of one of its fields is not provided, the application startup will fail and a `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.DeploymentException` indicating the missing value information will be thrown.\n+This does not apply to `Optional` fields and fields with a default value.\n+\n+=== Additional notes on @ConfigProperties\n+\n+When using a regular class annotated with `@ConfigProperties` the class doesn't necessarily have to declare getters and setters.\n+Having simple public non-final fields is valid as well.\n+\n+Furthermore, the configuration classes support nested object configuration. Suppose there was a need to have an extra layer\n+of greeting configuration named `content` that would contain a few fields. This could be achieved like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+    public Optional<String> name;\n+    public ContentConfig content; <1>\n+\n+    public static class ContentConfig {\n+        public Integer prizeAmount;\n+        public List<String> recipients;\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+<1> The name of the field (not the class name) will determine the name of the properties that are bound to the object.\n+\n+Setting the properties would occur in the normal manner, for example in `application.properties` one could have:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+greeting.message = hello\n+greeting.name = quarkus\n+greeting.content.prize-amount=10\n+greeting.content.recipients=Jane,John\n+----\n+\n+Furthermore, classes annotated with `@ConfigProperties` can be annotated with Bean Validation annotations similar to the following example:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @Size(min = 20)\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+\n+}\n+----\n+\n+WARNING: For validation to work, the `quarkus-hibernate-validator` extension needs to be present.\n+\n+If the validation fails with the given configuration, the application will fail to start and indicate the corresponding validation errors in the log.\n+\n+In the case of an interface being annotated with `@ConfigProperties`, the interface is allowed to extend other interfaces and methods from\n+the entire interface hierarchy are used to bind properties.\n+\n+=== Using same ConfigProperties with different prefixes\n+\n+Quarkus also supports the use of the same `@ConfigProperties` object with different prefixes for each injection point using the `io.quarkus.arc.config.@ConfigPrefix` annotation.\n+Say for example that `GreetingConfiguration` from above needs to be used for both the `greeting` prefix and the `other` prefix.\n+In that case the code would look like so:\n+\n+`GreetingConfiguration.java`\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @Size(min = 20)\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+\n+}\n+----\n+\n+`SomeBean.java`\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ApplicationScoped\n+public class SomeBean {\n+\n+    @Inject <1>\n+    GreetingConfiguration greetingConfiguration;\n+\n+    @ConfigPrefix(\"other\") <2>\n+    GreetingConfiguration otherConfiguration;\n+\n+}\n+----\n+<1> At this injection point `greetingConfiguration` will use the `greeting` prefix since that is what has been defined on `@ConfigProperties`.\n+<2> At this injection point `otherConfiguration` will use the `other` prefix from `@ConfigPrefix` instead of the `greeting` prefix. Notice that in this case `@Inject` is not required.\n+\n+[[configuration_profiles]]\n+== Configuration Profiles\n+\n+Quarkus supports the notion of configuration profiles. \n+These allow you to have multiple configurations in the same file and select between them via a profile name.\n+\n+The syntax for this is `%{profile}.config.key=value`. For example if I have the following:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+quarkus.http.port=9090\n+%dev.quarkus.http.port=8181\n+----\n+\n+The Quarkus HTTP port will be 9090, unless the `dev` profile is active, in which case it will be 8181.\n+\n+To use profiles in the `.env` file, you can follow a `_{PROFILE}_CONFIG_KEY=value` pattern. An equivalent of the above example in an `.env` file would be:\n+\n+[source,.env]\n+----\n+QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=9090\n+_DEV_QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=8181\n+----\n+\n+By default Quarkus has three profiles, although it is possible to use as many as you like. \n+The default profiles are:\n+\n+* *dev* - Activated when in development mode (i.e. `quarkus:dev`)\n+* *test* - Activated when running tests\n+* *prod* - The default profile when not running in development or test mode\n+\n+There are two ways to set a custom profile, either via the `quarkus.profile` system property or the `QUARKUS_PROFILE`\n+environment variable. If both are set the system property takes precedence. Note that it is not necessary to\n+define the names of these profiles anywhere, all that is necessary is to create a config property with the profile\n+name, and then set the current profile to that name. For example if I want a `staging` profile with a different HTTP port I can add the following to `application.properties`:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+quarkus.http.port=9090\n+%staging.quarkus.http.port=9999\n+----\n+\n+And then set the `QUARKUS_PROFILE` environment variable to `staging` to activate my profile.\n+\n+[NOTE]\n+====\n+The proper way to check the active profile programmatically is to use the `getActiveProfile` method of `io.quarkus.runtime.configuration.ProfileManager`.\n+\n+Using `@ConfigProperty(\"quarkus.profile\")` will *not* work properly.\n+====\n+\n+=== Default Runtime Profile\n+\n+The default Quarkus application runtime profile is set to the profile used to build the application.\n+For example:\n+[source,bash]\n+----\n+./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.profile=prod-aws\n+./target/my-app-1.0-runner // <1>\n+----\n+<1> The command will run with the `prod-aws` profile. This can be overridden using the `quarkus.profile` system property.\n+\n+\n+[[using_property_expressions]]\n+== Using Property Expressions\n+\n+Quarkus supports the use of property expressions in the `application.properties` file.\n+\n+These expressions are resolved when the property is read.\n+So if your configuration property is a build time configuration property, the property expression will be resolved at build time.\n+If your configuration property is overridable at runtime, the property expression will be resolved at runtime.\n+\n+You can use property expressions both for the Quarkus configuration or for your own configuration properties.\n+\n+Property expressions are defined this way: `${my-property-expression}`.\n+\n+For example, having the following property:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+remote.host=quarkus.io\n+----\n+and another property defined as:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+callable.url=https://${remote.host}/\n+----\n+\n+will result in the value of the `callable.url` property being set to:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+callable.url=https://quarkus.io/\n+----\n+\n+Another example would be defining different database servers depending on the profile used:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+%dev.quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://remotehost:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+----\n+\n+can be simplified by having:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+%dev.application.server=localhost\n+application.server=remotehost\n+\n+quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://${application.server}:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+----\n+\n+It does result in one more line in this example but the value of `application.server` can be reused in other properties,\n+diminishing the possibility of typos and providing more flexibility in property definitions.\n+\n+\n+[#combine-property-env-var]\n+== Combining Property Expressions and Environment Variables\n+\n+Quarkus also supports the combination of both property expressions and environment variables.\n+\n+Let's assume you have following property defined in `application.properties`:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+remote.host=quarkus.io\n+----\n+\n+You can combine environment variables and property expressions by having a property defined as follows:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+application.host=${HOST:${remote.host}}\n+----\n+\n+This will expand the `HOST` environment variable and use the value of the property `remote.host` as the default value if `HOST` is not set.\n+\n+For the purpose of this section we used the property `remote.host` we defined previously.\n+It has to be noted that the value could have been a fixed one such as in:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+application.host=${HOST:localhost}\n+----\n+\n+which will result in `localhost` as the default value if `HOST` is not set.\n+\n+[[configuring_quarkus]]\n+== Configuring Quarkus\n+\n+Quarkus itself is configured via the same mechanism as your application. Quarkus reserves the `quarkus.` namespace\n+for its own configuration and the configuration of all of its extensions. For example to configure the HTTP server port you can set `quarkus.http.port` in\n+`application.properties`. All the Quarkus configuration properties are link:all-config[documented and searchable].\n+\n+[IMPORTANT]\n+====\n+As mentioned above, properties prefixed with `quarkus.` are effectively reserved for configuring Quarkus itself and", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "8db2a006915902929439f7b14ff4b7c998e5fd1c"}, "originalPosition": 471}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMzMxMzQxMzY4OnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "docs/src/main/asciidoc/config-reference.adoc", "isResolved": true, "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0yMlQxNzoxMzo0NFrOH34zxw==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0yMlQxNzoxMzo0NFrOH34zxw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyODM2NDQ4Nw==", "bodyText": "This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

To make use of it, `config/application.properties` needs to be placed inside the build tool's output directory (`target` for Maven and `build/classes/java/main` for Gradle).\n+Keep in mind however that any cleaning operation from the build tool like `mvn clean` or `gradle clean` will remove the `config` directory as well.\n+\n+[[application_properties_file]]\n+=== An application configuration file\n+\n+This is the main application configuration file located in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.\n+\n+.Example `application.properties` file\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+greeting.message=hello <1>\n+quarkus.http.port=9090 <2>\n+----\n+<1> This is a user-defind configuration property.\n+<2> This is a configuration property consumed by the `quarkus-vertx-http` extension.\n+\n+TIP: Quarkus supports the use of <<using_property_expressions,property expressions>> in the `application.properties` file.\n+\n+== Injecting configuration properties\n+\n+Quarkus uses https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config] annotations to inject the configuration properties in the application.\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.message\") <1>\n+String message;\n+----\n+<1> You can use `@Inject @ConfigProperty` or just `@ConfigProperty`.\n+The `@Inject` annotation is not necessary for members annotated with `@ConfigProperty`.\n+This behavior differs from https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config].\n+\n+NOTE: If the application attempts to inject a configuration property that is not set, an error is thrown, thus allowing you to quickly know when your configuration is complete.\n+\n+.More `@ConfigProperty` Examples\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.message\") <1>\n+String message;\n+\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.suffix\", defaultValue=\"!\") <2>\n+String suffix;\n+\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.name\")\n+Optional<String> name; <3>\n+----\n+<1> If you do not provide a value for this property, the application startup fails with `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.DeploymentException: No config value of type [class java.lang.String] exists for: greeting.message`.\n+<2> The default value is injected if the configuration does not provide a value for `greeting.suffix`.\n+<3> This property is optional - an empty `Optional` is injected if the configuration does not provide a value for `greeting.name`.\n+\n+== Programmatically access the configuration\n+\n+You can also access the configuration programmatically.\n+It can be handy to achieve dynamic lookup, or retrieve configured values from classes that are neither CDI beans or JAX-RS resources.\n+\n+You can access the configuration programmatically using `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.ConfigProvider.getConfig()` such as in:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+String databaseName = ConfigProvider.getConfig().getValue(\"database.name\", String.class);\n+Optional<String> maybeDatabaseName = ConfigProvider.getConfig().getOptionalValue(\"database.name\", String.class);\n+----\n+\n+[[using_configproperties]]\n+== Using @ConfigProperties\n+\n+As an alternative to injecting multiple related configuration values in the way that was shown in the previous example,\n+users can also use the `@io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties` annotation to group these properties together.\n+\n+For the greeting properties above, a `GreetingConfiguration` class could be created like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+package org.acme.config;\n+\n+import io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties;\n+import java.util.Optional;\n+\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\") <1>\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    private String message;\n+    private String suffix = \"!\"; <2>\n+    private Optional<String> name;\n+\n+    public String getMessage() {\n+        return message;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setMessage(String message) {\n+        this.message = message;\n+    }\n+\n+    public String getSuffix() {\n+        return suffix;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setSuffix(String suffix) {\n+        this.suffix = suffix;\n+    }\n+\n+    public Optional<String> getName() {\n+        return name;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setName(Optional<String> name) {\n+        this.name = name;\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+<1> `prefix` is optional. If not set then the prefix to be used will be determined by the class name. In this case it would still be `greeting` (since the `Configuration` suffix is removed). If the class were named `GreetingExtraConfiguration` then the resulting default prefix would be `greeting-extra`.\n+<2> `!` will be the default value if `greeting.suffix` is not set\n+\n+This class could then be injected into the `GreetingResource` using the familiar CDI `@Inject` annotation like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@Inject\n+GreetingConfiguration greetingConfiguration;\n+----\n+\n+Another alternative style provided by Quarkus is to create `GreetingConfiguration` as an interface like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+package org.acme.config;\n+\n+import io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties;\n+import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.inject.ConfigProperty;\n+import java.util.Optional;\n+\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public interface GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @ConfigProperty(name = \"message\") <1>\n+    String message();\n+\n+    @ConfigProperty(defaultValue = \"!\")\n+    String getSuffix(); <2>\n+\n+    Optional<String> getName(); <3>\n+}\n+----\n+<1> The `@ConfigProperty` annotation is needed because the name of the configuration property that the method corresponds to doesn't follow the getter method naming conventions\n+<2> In this case since `name` was not set, the corresponding property will be `greeting.suffix`.\n+<3> It is unnecessary to specify the `@ConfigProperty` annotation because the method name follows the getter method naming conventions (`greeting.name` being the corresponding property) and no default value is needed.\n+\n+When using `@ConfigProperties` on a class or an interface, if the value of one of its fields is not provided, the application startup will fail and a `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.DeploymentException` indicating the missing value information will be thrown.\n+This does not apply to `Optional` fields and fields with a default value.\n+\n+=== Additional notes on @ConfigProperties\n+\n+When using a regular class annotated with `@ConfigProperties` the class doesn't necessarily have to declare getters and setters.\n+Having simple public non-final fields is valid as well.\n+\n+Furthermore, the configuration classes support nested object configuration. Suppose there was a need to have an extra layer\n+of greeting configuration named `content` that would contain a few fields. This could be achieved like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+    public Optional<String> name;\n+    public ContentConfig content; <1>\n+\n+    public static class ContentConfig {\n+        public Integer prizeAmount;\n+        public List<String> recipients;\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+<1> The name of the field (not the class name) will determine the name of the properties that are bound to the object.\n+\n+Setting the properties would occur in the normal manner, for example in `application.properties` one could have:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+greeting.message = hello\n+greeting.name = quarkus\n+greeting.content.prize-amount=10\n+greeting.content.recipients=Jane,John\n+----\n+\n+Furthermore, classes annotated with `@ConfigProperties` can be annotated with Bean Validation annotations similar to the following example:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @Size(min = 20)\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+\n+}\n+----\n+\n+WARNING: For validation to work, the `quarkus-hibernate-validator` extension needs to be present.\n+\n+If the validation fails with the given configuration, the application will fail to start and indicate the corresponding validation errors in the log.\n+\n+In the case of an interface being annotated with `@ConfigProperties`, the interface is allowed to extend other interfaces and methods from\n+the entire interface hierarchy are used to bind properties.\n+\n+=== Using same ConfigProperties with different prefixes\n+\n+Quarkus also supports the use of the same `@ConfigProperties` object with different prefixes for each injection point using the `io.quarkus.arc.config.@ConfigPrefix` annotation.\n+Say for example that `GreetingConfiguration` from above needs to be used for both the `greeting` prefix and the `other` prefix.\n+In that case the code would look like so:\n+\n+`GreetingConfiguration.java`\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @Size(min = 20)\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+\n+}\n+----\n+\n+`SomeBean.java`\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ApplicationScoped\n+public class SomeBean {\n+\n+    @Inject <1>\n+    GreetingConfiguration greetingConfiguration;\n+\n+    @ConfigPrefix(\"other\") <2>\n+    GreetingConfiguration otherConfiguration;\n+\n+}\n+----\n+<1> At this injection point `greetingConfiguration` will use the `greeting` prefix since that is what has been defined on `@ConfigProperties`.\n+<2> At this injection point `otherConfiguration` will use the `other` prefix from `@ConfigPrefix` instead of the `greeting` prefix. Notice that in this case `@Inject` is not required.\n+\n+[[configuration_profiles]]\n+== Configuration Profiles\n+\n+Quarkus supports the notion of configuration profiles. \n+These allow you to have multiple configurations in the same file and select between them via a profile name.\n+\n+The syntax for this is `%{profile}.config.key=value`. For example if I have the following:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+quarkus.http.port=9090\n+%dev.quarkus.http.port=8181\n+----\n+\n+The Quarkus HTTP port will be 9090, unless the `dev` profile is active, in which case it will be 8181.\n+\n+To use profiles in the `.env` file, you can follow a `_{PROFILE}_CONFIG_KEY=value` pattern. An equivalent of the above example in an `.env` file would be:\n+\n+[source,.env]\n+----\n+QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=9090\n+_DEV_QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=8181\n+----\n+\n+By default Quarkus has three profiles, although it is possible to use as many as you like. \n+The default profiles are:\n+\n+* *dev* - Activated when in development mode (i.e. `quarkus:dev`)\n+* *test* - Activated when running tests\n+* *prod* - The default profile when not running in development or test mode\n+\n+There are two ways to set a custom profile, either via the `quarkus.profile` system property or the `QUARKUS_PROFILE`\n+environment variable. If both are set the system property takes precedence. Note that it is not necessary to\n+define the names of these profiles anywhere, all that is necessary is to create a config property with the profile\n+name, and then set the current profile to that name. For example if I want a `staging` profile with a different HTTP port I can add the following to `application.properties`:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+quarkus.http.port=9090\n+%staging.quarkus.http.port=9999\n+----\n+\n+And then set the `QUARKUS_PROFILE` environment variable to `staging` to activate my profile.\n+\n+[NOTE]\n+====\n+The proper way to check the active profile programmatically is to use the `getActiveProfile` method of `io.quarkus.runtime.configuration.ProfileManager`.\n+\n+Using `@ConfigProperty(\"quarkus.profile\")` will *not* work properly.\n+====\n+\n+=== Default Runtime Profile\n+\n+The default Quarkus application runtime profile is set to the profile used to build the application.\n+For example:\n+[source,bash]\n+----\n+./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.profile=prod-aws\n+./target/my-app-1.0-runner // <1>\n+----\n+<1> The command will run with the `prod-aws` profile. This can be overridden using the `quarkus.profile` system property.\n+\n+\n+[[using_property_expressions]]\n+== Using Property Expressions\n+\n+Quarkus supports the use of property expressions in the `application.properties` file.\n+\n+These expressions are resolved when the property is read.\n+So if your configuration property is a build time configuration property, the property expression will be resolved at build time.\n+If your configuration property is overridable at runtime, the property expression will be resolved at runtime.\n+\n+You can use property expressions both for the Quarkus configuration or for your own configuration properties.\n+\n+Property expressions are defined this way: `${my-property-expression}`.\n+\n+For example, having the following property:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+remote.host=quarkus.io\n+----\n+and another property defined as:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+callable.url=https://${remote.host}/\n+----\n+\n+will result in the value of the `callable.url` property being set to:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+callable.url=https://quarkus.io/\n+----\n+\n+Another example would be defining different database servers depending on the profile used:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+%dev.quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://remotehost:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+----\n+\n+can be simplified by having:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+%dev.application.server=localhost\n+application.server=remotehost\n+\n+quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://${application.server}:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+----\n+\n+It does result in one more line in this example but the value of `application.server` can be reused in other properties,\n+diminishing the possibility of typos and providing more flexibility in property definitions.\n+\n+\n+[#combine-property-env-var]\n+== Combining Property Expressions and Environment Variables\n+\n+Quarkus also supports the combination of both property expressions and environment variables.\n+\n+Let's assume you have following property defined in `application.properties`:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+remote.host=quarkus.io\n+----\n+\n+You can combine environment variables and property expressions by having a property defined as follows:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+application.host=${HOST:${remote.host}}\n+----\n+\n+This will expand the `HOST` environment variable and use the value of the property `remote.host` as the default value if `HOST` is not set.\n+\n+For the purpose of this section we used the property `remote.host` we defined previously.\n+It has to be noted that the value could have been a fixed one such as in:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+application.host=${HOST:localhost}\n+----\n+\n+which will result in `localhost` as the default value if `HOST` is not set.\n+\n+[[configuring_quarkus]]\n+== Configuring Quarkus\n+\n+Quarkus itself is configured via the same mechanism as your application. Quarkus reserves the `quarkus.` namespace\n+for its own configuration and the configuration of all of its extensions. For example to configure the HTTP server port you can set `quarkus.http.port` in\n+`application.properties`. All the Quarkus configuration properties are link:all-config[documented and searchable].\n+\n+[IMPORTANT]\n+====\n+As mentioned above, properties prefixed with `quarkus.` are effectively reserved for configuring Quarkus itself and\n+therefore `quarkus.` should **never** be used as prefix for application specific properties.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "8db2a006915902929439f7b14ff4b7c998e5fd1c"}, "originalPosition": 472}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMzMxMzQxNDYwOnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "docs/src/main/asciidoc/config-reference.adoc", "isResolved": true, "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0yMlQxNzoxNDo0NVrOH340Ow==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0yMlQxNzoxNDo0NVrOH340Ow==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyODM2NDYwMw==", "bodyText": "This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

To make use of it, `config/application.properties` needs to be placed inside the build tool's output directory (`target` for Maven and `build/classes/java/main` for Gradle).\n+Keep in mind however that any cleaning operation from the build tool like `mvn clean` or `gradle clean` will remove the `config` directory as well.\n+\n+[[application_properties_file]]\n+=== An application configuration file\n+\n+This is the main application configuration file located in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.\n+\n+.Example `application.properties` file\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+greeting.message=hello <1>\n+quarkus.http.port=9090 <2>\n+----\n+<1> This is a user-defind configuration property.\n+<2> This is a configuration property consumed by the `quarkus-vertx-http` extension.\n+\n+TIP: Quarkus supports the use of <<using_property_expressions,property expressions>> in the `application.properties` file.\n+\n+== Injecting configuration properties\n+\n+Quarkus uses https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config] annotations to inject the configuration properties in the application.\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.message\") <1>\n+String message;\n+----\n+<1> You can use `@Inject @ConfigProperty` or just `@ConfigProperty`.\n+The `@Inject` annotation is not necessary for members annotated with `@ConfigProperty`.\n+This behavior differs from https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config].\n+\n+NOTE: If the application attempts to inject a configuration property that is not set, an error is thrown, thus allowing you to quickly know when your configuration is complete.\n+\n+.More `@ConfigProperty` Examples\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.message\") <1>\n+String message;\n+\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.suffix\", defaultValue=\"!\") <2>\n+String suffix;\n+\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.name\")\n+Optional<String> name; <3>\n+----\n+<1> If you do not provide a value for this property, the application startup fails with `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.DeploymentException: No config value of type [class java.lang.String] exists for: greeting.message`.\n+<2> The default value is injected if the configuration does not provide a value for `greeting.suffix`.\n+<3> This property is optional - an empty `Optional` is injected if the configuration does not provide a value for `greeting.name`.\n+\n+== Programmatically access the configuration\n+\n+You can also access the configuration programmatically.\n+It can be handy to achieve dynamic lookup, or retrieve configured values from classes that are neither CDI beans or JAX-RS resources.\n+\n+You can access the configuration programmatically using `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.ConfigProvider.getConfig()` such as in:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+String databaseName = ConfigProvider.getConfig().getValue(\"database.name\", String.class);\n+Optional<String> maybeDatabaseName = ConfigProvider.getConfig().getOptionalValue(\"database.name\", String.class);\n+----\n+\n+[[using_configproperties]]\n+== Using @ConfigProperties\n+\n+As an alternative to injecting multiple related configuration values in the way that was shown in the previous example,\n+users can also use the `@io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties` annotation to group these properties together.\n+\n+For the greeting properties above, a `GreetingConfiguration` class could be created like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+package org.acme.config;\n+\n+import io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties;\n+import java.util.Optional;\n+\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\") <1>\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    private String message;\n+    private String suffix = \"!\"; <2>\n+    private Optional<String> name;\n+\n+    public String getMessage() {\n+        return message;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setMessage(String message) {\n+        this.message = message;\n+    }\n+\n+    public String getSuffix() {\n+        return suffix;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setSuffix(String suffix) {\n+        this.suffix = suffix;\n+    }\n+\n+    public Optional<String> getName() {\n+        return name;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setName(Optional<String> name) {\n+        this.name = name;\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+<1> `prefix` is optional. If not set then the prefix to be used will be determined by the class name. In this case it would still be `greeting` (since the `Configuration` suffix is removed). If the class were named `GreetingExtraConfiguration` then the resulting default prefix would be `greeting-extra`.\n+<2> `!` will be the default value if `greeting.suffix` is not set\n+\n+This class could then be injected into the `GreetingResource` using the familiar CDI `@Inject` annotation like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@Inject\n+GreetingConfiguration greetingConfiguration;\n+----\n+\n+Another alternative style provided by Quarkus is to create `GreetingConfiguration` as an interface like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+package org.acme.config;\n+\n+import io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties;\n+import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.inject.ConfigProperty;\n+import java.util.Optional;\n+\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public interface GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @ConfigProperty(name = \"message\") <1>\n+    String message();\n+\n+    @ConfigProperty(defaultValue = \"!\")\n+    String getSuffix(); <2>\n+\n+    Optional<String> getName(); <3>\n+}\n+----\n+<1> The `@ConfigProperty` annotation is needed because the name of the configuration property that the method corresponds to doesn't follow the getter method naming conventions\n+<2> In this case since `name` was not set, the corresponding property will be `greeting.suffix`.\n+<3> It is unnecessary to specify the `@ConfigProperty` annotation because the method name follows the getter method naming conventions (`greeting.name` being the corresponding property) and no default value is needed.\n+\n+When using `@ConfigProperties` on a class or an interface, if the value of one of its fields is not provided, the application startup will fail and a `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.DeploymentException` indicating the missing value information will be thrown.\n+This does not apply to `Optional` fields and fields with a default value.\n+\n+=== Additional notes on @ConfigProperties\n+\n+When using a regular class annotated with `@ConfigProperties` the class doesn't necessarily have to declare getters and setters.\n+Having simple public non-final fields is valid as well.\n+\n+Furthermore, the configuration classes support nested object configuration. Suppose there was a need to have an extra layer\n+of greeting configuration named `content` that would contain a few fields. This could be achieved like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+    public Optional<String> name;\n+    public ContentConfig content; <1>\n+\n+    public static class ContentConfig {\n+        public Integer prizeAmount;\n+        public List<String> recipients;\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+<1> The name of the field (not the class name) will determine the name of the properties that are bound to the object.\n+\n+Setting the properties would occur in the normal manner, for example in `application.properties` one could have:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+greeting.message = hello\n+greeting.name = quarkus\n+greeting.content.prize-amount=10\n+greeting.content.recipients=Jane,John\n+----\n+\n+Furthermore, classes annotated with `@ConfigProperties` can be annotated with Bean Validation annotations similar to the following example:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @Size(min = 20)\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+\n+}\n+----\n+\n+WARNING: For validation to work, the `quarkus-hibernate-validator` extension needs to be present.\n+\n+If the validation fails with the given configuration, the application will fail to start and indicate the corresponding validation errors in the log.\n+\n+In the case of an interface being annotated with `@ConfigProperties`, the interface is allowed to extend other interfaces and methods from\n+the entire interface hierarchy are used to bind properties.\n+\n+=== Using same ConfigProperties with different prefixes\n+\n+Quarkus also supports the use of the same `@ConfigProperties` object with different prefixes for each injection point using the `io.quarkus.arc.config.@ConfigPrefix` annotation.\n+Say for example that `GreetingConfiguration` from above needs to be used for both the `greeting` prefix and the `other` prefix.\n+In that case the code would look like so:\n+\n+`GreetingConfiguration.java`\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @Size(min = 20)\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+\n+}\n+----\n+\n+`SomeBean.java`\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ApplicationScoped\n+public class SomeBean {\n+\n+    @Inject <1>\n+    GreetingConfiguration greetingConfiguration;\n+\n+    @ConfigPrefix(\"other\") <2>\n+    GreetingConfiguration otherConfiguration;\n+\n+}\n+----\n+<1> At this injection point `greetingConfiguration` will use the `greeting` prefix since that is what has been defined on `@ConfigProperties`.\n+<2> At this injection point `otherConfiguration` will use the `other` prefix from `@ConfigPrefix` instead of the `greeting` prefix. Notice that in this case `@Inject` is not required.\n+\n+[[configuration_profiles]]\n+== Configuration Profiles\n+\n+Quarkus supports the notion of configuration profiles. \n+These allow you to have multiple configurations in the same file and select between them via a profile name.\n+\n+The syntax for this is `%{profile}.config.key=value`. For example if I have the following:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+quarkus.http.port=9090\n+%dev.quarkus.http.port=8181\n+----\n+\n+The Quarkus HTTP port will be 9090, unless the `dev` profile is active, in which case it will be 8181.\n+\n+To use profiles in the `.env` file, you can follow a `_{PROFILE}_CONFIG_KEY=value` pattern. An equivalent of the above example in an `.env` file would be:\n+\n+[source,.env]\n+----\n+QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=9090\n+_DEV_QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=8181\n+----\n+\n+By default Quarkus has three profiles, although it is possible to use as many as you like. \n+The default profiles are:\n+\n+* *dev* - Activated when in development mode (i.e. `quarkus:dev`)\n+* *test* - Activated when running tests\n+* *prod* - The default profile when not running in development or test mode\n+\n+There are two ways to set a custom profile, either via the `quarkus.profile` system property or the `QUARKUS_PROFILE`\n+environment variable. If both are set the system property takes precedence. Note that it is not necessary to\n+define the names of these profiles anywhere, all that is necessary is to create a config property with the profile\n+name, and then set the current profile to that name. For example if I want a `staging` profile with a different HTTP port I can add the following to `application.properties`:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+quarkus.http.port=9090\n+%staging.quarkus.http.port=9999\n+----\n+\n+And then set the `QUARKUS_PROFILE` environment variable to `staging` to activate my profile.\n+\n+[NOTE]\n+====\n+The proper way to check the active profile programmatically is to use the `getActiveProfile` method of `io.quarkus.runtime.configuration.ProfileManager`.\n+\n+Using `@ConfigProperty(\"quarkus.profile\")` will *not* work properly.\n+====\n+\n+=== Default Runtime Profile\n+\n+The default Quarkus application runtime profile is set to the profile used to build the application.\n+For example:\n+[source,bash]\n+----\n+./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.profile=prod-aws\n+./target/my-app-1.0-runner // <1>\n+----\n+<1> The command will run with the `prod-aws` profile. This can be overridden using the `quarkus.profile` system property.\n+\n+\n+[[using_property_expressions]]\n+== Using Property Expressions\n+\n+Quarkus supports the use of property expressions in the `application.properties` file.\n+\n+These expressions are resolved when the property is read.\n+So if your configuration property is a build time configuration property, the property expression will be resolved at build time.\n+If your configuration property is overridable at runtime, the property expression will be resolved at runtime.\n+\n+You can use property expressions both for the Quarkus configuration or for your own configuration properties.\n+\n+Property expressions are defined this way: `${my-property-expression}`.\n+\n+For example, having the following property:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+remote.host=quarkus.io\n+----\n+and another property defined as:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+callable.url=https://${remote.host}/\n+----\n+\n+will result in the value of the `callable.url` property being set to:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+callable.url=https://quarkus.io/\n+----\n+\n+Another example would be defining different database servers depending on the profile used:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+%dev.quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://remotehost:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+----\n+\n+can be simplified by having:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+%dev.application.server=localhost\n+application.server=remotehost\n+\n+quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://${application.server}:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+----\n+\n+It does result in one more line in this example but the value of `application.server` can be reused in other properties,\n+diminishing the possibility of typos and providing more flexibility in property definitions.\n+\n+\n+[#combine-property-env-var]\n+== Combining Property Expressions and Environment Variables\n+\n+Quarkus also supports the combination of both property expressions and environment variables.\n+\n+Let's assume you have following property defined in `application.properties`:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+remote.host=quarkus.io\n+----\n+\n+You can combine environment variables and property expressions by having a property defined as follows:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+application.host=${HOST:${remote.host}}\n+----\n+\n+This will expand the `HOST` environment variable and use the value of the property `remote.host` as the default value if `HOST` is not set.\n+\n+For the purpose of this section we used the property `remote.host` we defined previously.\n+It has to be noted that the value could have been a fixed one such as in:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+application.host=${HOST:localhost}\n+----\n+\n+which will result in `localhost` as the default value if `HOST` is not set.\n+\n+[[configuring_quarkus]]\n+== Configuring Quarkus\n+\n+Quarkus itself is configured via the same mechanism as your application. Quarkus reserves the `quarkus.` namespace\n+for its own configuration and the configuration of all of its extensions. For example to configure the HTTP server port you can set `quarkus.http.port` in\n+`application.properties`. All the Quarkus configuration properties are link:all-config[documented and searchable].\n+\n+[IMPORTANT]\n+====\n+As mentioned above, properties prefixed with `quarkus.` are effectively reserved for configuring Quarkus itself and\n+therefore `quarkus.` should **never** be used as prefix for application specific properties.\n+\n+In the previous examples using `quarkus.message` instead of `greeting.message` would result in unexpected behavior.\n+====\n+\n+Quarkus does much of its configuration and bootstrap at build time and most configuration properties are read and used during the build.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "8db2a006915902929439f7b14ff4b7c998e5fd1c"}, "originalPosition": 477}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMzMxMzQxNTI3OnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "docs/src/main/asciidoc/config-reference.adoc", "isResolved": true, "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0yMlQxNzoxNToxN1rOH340jg==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0yMlQxNzoxNToxN1rOH340jg==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyODM2NDY4Ng==", "bodyText": "This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

To make use of it, `config/application.properties` needs to be placed inside the build tool's output directory (`target` for Maven and `build/classes/java/main` for Gradle).\n+Keep in mind however that any cleaning operation from the build tool like `mvn clean` or `gradle clean` will remove the `config` directory as well.\n+\n+[[application_properties_file]]\n+=== An application configuration file\n+\n+This is the main application configuration file located in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.\n+\n+.Example `application.properties` file\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+greeting.message=hello <1>\n+quarkus.http.port=9090 <2>\n+----\n+<1> This is a user-defind configuration property.\n+<2> This is a configuration property consumed by the `quarkus-vertx-http` extension.\n+\n+TIP: Quarkus supports the use of <<using_property_expressions,property expressions>> in the `application.properties` file.\n+\n+== Injecting configuration properties\n+\n+Quarkus uses https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config] annotations to inject the configuration properties in the application.\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.message\") <1>\n+String message;\n+----\n+<1> You can use `@Inject @ConfigProperty` or just `@ConfigProperty`.\n+The `@Inject` annotation is not necessary for members annotated with `@ConfigProperty`.\n+This behavior differs from https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config].\n+\n+NOTE: If the application attempts to inject a configuration property that is not set, an error is thrown, thus allowing you to quickly know when your configuration is complete.\n+\n+.More `@ConfigProperty` Examples\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.message\") <1>\n+String message;\n+\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.suffix\", defaultValue=\"!\") <2>\n+String suffix;\n+\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.name\")\n+Optional<String> name; <3>\n+----\n+<1> If you do not provide a value for this property, the application startup fails with `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.DeploymentException: No config value of type [class java.lang.String] exists for: greeting.message`.\n+<2> The default value is injected if the configuration does not provide a value for `greeting.suffix`.\n+<3> This property is optional - an empty `Optional` is injected if the configuration does not provide a value for `greeting.name`.\n+\n+== Programmatically access the configuration\n+\n+You can also access the configuration programmatically.\n+It can be handy to achieve dynamic lookup, or retrieve configured values from classes that are neither CDI beans or JAX-RS resources.\n+\n+You can access the configuration programmatically using `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.ConfigProvider.getConfig()` such as in:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+String databaseName = ConfigProvider.getConfig().getValue(\"database.name\", String.class);\n+Optional<String> maybeDatabaseName = ConfigProvider.getConfig().getOptionalValue(\"database.name\", String.class);\n+----\n+\n+[[using_configproperties]]\n+== Using @ConfigProperties\n+\n+As an alternative to injecting multiple related configuration values in the way that was shown in the previous example,\n+users can also use the `@io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties` annotation to group these properties together.\n+\n+For the greeting properties above, a `GreetingConfiguration` class could be created like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+package org.acme.config;\n+\n+import io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties;\n+import java.util.Optional;\n+\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\") <1>\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    private String message;\n+    private String suffix = \"!\"; <2>\n+    private Optional<String> name;\n+\n+    public String getMessage() {\n+        return message;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setMessage(String message) {\n+        this.message = message;\n+    }\n+\n+    public String getSuffix() {\n+        return suffix;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setSuffix(String suffix) {\n+        this.suffix = suffix;\n+    }\n+\n+    public Optional<String> getName() {\n+        return name;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setName(Optional<String> name) {\n+        this.name = name;\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+<1> `prefix` is optional. If not set then the prefix to be used will be determined by the class name. In this case it would still be `greeting` (since the `Configuration` suffix is removed). If the class were named `GreetingExtraConfiguration` then the resulting default prefix would be `greeting-extra`.\n+<2> `!` will be the default value if `greeting.suffix` is not set\n+\n+This class could then be injected into the `GreetingResource` using the familiar CDI `@Inject` annotation like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@Inject\n+GreetingConfiguration greetingConfiguration;\n+----\n+\n+Another alternative style provided by Quarkus is to create `GreetingConfiguration` as an interface like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+package org.acme.config;\n+\n+import io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties;\n+import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.inject.ConfigProperty;\n+import java.util.Optional;\n+\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public interface GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @ConfigProperty(name = \"message\") <1>\n+    String message();\n+\n+    @ConfigProperty(defaultValue = \"!\")\n+    String getSuffix(); <2>\n+\n+    Optional<String> getName(); <3>\n+}\n+----\n+<1> The `@ConfigProperty` annotation is needed because the name of the configuration property that the method corresponds to doesn't follow the getter method naming conventions\n+<2> In this case since `name` was not set, the corresponding property will be `greeting.suffix`.\n+<3> It is unnecessary to specify the `@ConfigProperty` annotation because the method name follows the getter method naming conventions (`greeting.name` being the corresponding property) and no default value is needed.\n+\n+When using `@ConfigProperties` on a class or an interface, if the value of one of its fields is not provided, the application startup will fail and a `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.DeploymentException` indicating the missing value information will be thrown.\n+This does not apply to `Optional` fields and fields with a default value.\n+\n+=== Additional notes on @ConfigProperties\n+\n+When using a regular class annotated with `@ConfigProperties` the class doesn't necessarily have to declare getters and setters.\n+Having simple public non-final fields is valid as well.\n+\n+Furthermore, the configuration classes support nested object configuration. Suppose there was a need to have an extra layer\n+of greeting configuration named `content` that would contain a few fields. This could be achieved like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+    public Optional<String> name;\n+    public ContentConfig content; <1>\n+\n+    public static class ContentConfig {\n+        public Integer prizeAmount;\n+        public List<String> recipients;\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+<1> The name of the field (not the class name) will determine the name of the properties that are bound to the object.\n+\n+Setting the properties would occur in the normal manner, for example in `application.properties` one could have:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+greeting.message = hello\n+greeting.name = quarkus\n+greeting.content.prize-amount=10\n+greeting.content.recipients=Jane,John\n+----\n+\n+Furthermore, classes annotated with `@ConfigProperties` can be annotated with Bean Validation annotations similar to the following example:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @Size(min = 20)\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+\n+}\n+----\n+\n+WARNING: For validation to work, the `quarkus-hibernate-validator` extension needs to be present.\n+\n+If the validation fails with the given configuration, the application will fail to start and indicate the corresponding validation errors in the log.\n+\n+In the case of an interface being annotated with `@ConfigProperties`, the interface is allowed to extend other interfaces and methods from\n+the entire interface hierarchy are used to bind properties.\n+\n+=== Using same ConfigProperties with different prefixes\n+\n+Quarkus also supports the use of the same `@ConfigProperties` object with different prefixes for each injection point using the `io.quarkus.arc.config.@ConfigPrefix` annotation.\n+Say for example that `GreetingConfiguration` from above needs to be used for both the `greeting` prefix and the `other` prefix.\n+In that case the code would look like so:\n+\n+`GreetingConfiguration.java`\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @Size(min = 20)\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+\n+}\n+----\n+\n+`SomeBean.java`\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ApplicationScoped\n+public class SomeBean {\n+\n+    @Inject <1>\n+    GreetingConfiguration greetingConfiguration;\n+\n+    @ConfigPrefix(\"other\") <2>\n+    GreetingConfiguration otherConfiguration;\n+\n+}\n+----\n+<1> At this injection point `greetingConfiguration` will use the `greeting` prefix since that is what has been defined on `@ConfigProperties`.\n+<2> At this injection point `otherConfiguration` will use the `other` prefix from `@ConfigPrefix` instead of the `greeting` prefix. Notice that in this case `@Inject` is not required.\n+\n+[[configuration_profiles]]\n+== Configuration Profiles\n+\n+Quarkus supports the notion of configuration profiles. \n+These allow you to have multiple configurations in the same file and select between them via a profile name.\n+\n+The syntax for this is `%{profile}.config.key=value`. For example if I have the following:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+quarkus.http.port=9090\n+%dev.quarkus.http.port=8181\n+----\n+\n+The Quarkus HTTP port will be 9090, unless the `dev` profile is active, in which case it will be 8181.\n+\n+To use profiles in the `.env` file, you can follow a `_{PROFILE}_CONFIG_KEY=value` pattern. An equivalent of the above example in an `.env` file would be:\n+\n+[source,.env]\n+----\n+QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=9090\n+_DEV_QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=8181\n+----\n+\n+By default Quarkus has three profiles, although it is possible to use as many as you like. \n+The default profiles are:\n+\n+* *dev* - Activated when in development mode (i.e. `quarkus:dev`)\n+* *test* - Activated when running tests\n+* *prod* - The default profile when not running in development or test mode\n+\n+There are two ways to set a custom profile, either via the `quarkus.profile` system property or the `QUARKUS_PROFILE`\n+environment variable. If both are set the system property takes precedence. Note that it is not necessary to\n+define the names of these profiles anywhere, all that is necessary is to create a config property with the profile\n+name, and then set the current profile to that name. For example if I want a `staging` profile with a different HTTP port I can add the following to `application.properties`:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+quarkus.http.port=9090\n+%staging.quarkus.http.port=9999\n+----\n+\n+And then set the `QUARKUS_PROFILE` environment variable to `staging` to activate my profile.\n+\n+[NOTE]\n+====\n+The proper way to check the active profile programmatically is to use the `getActiveProfile` method of `io.quarkus.runtime.configuration.ProfileManager`.\n+\n+Using `@ConfigProperty(\"quarkus.profile\")` will *not* work properly.\n+====\n+\n+=== Default Runtime Profile\n+\n+The default Quarkus application runtime profile is set to the profile used to build the application.\n+For example:\n+[source,bash]\n+----\n+./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.profile=prod-aws\n+./target/my-app-1.0-runner // <1>\n+----\n+<1> The command will run with the `prod-aws` profile. This can be overridden using the `quarkus.profile` system property.\n+\n+\n+[[using_property_expressions]]\n+== Using Property Expressions\n+\n+Quarkus supports the use of property expressions in the `application.properties` file.\n+\n+These expressions are resolved when the property is read.\n+So if your configuration property is a build time configuration property, the property expression will be resolved at build time.\n+If your configuration property is overridable at runtime, the property expression will be resolved at runtime.\n+\n+You can use property expressions both for the Quarkus configuration or for your own configuration properties.\n+\n+Property expressions are defined this way: `${my-property-expression}`.\n+\n+For example, having the following property:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+remote.host=quarkus.io\n+----\n+and another property defined as:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+callable.url=https://${remote.host}/\n+----\n+\n+will result in the value of the `callable.url` property being set to:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+callable.url=https://quarkus.io/\n+----\n+\n+Another example would be defining different database servers depending on the profile used:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+%dev.quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://remotehost:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+----\n+\n+can be simplified by having:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+%dev.application.server=localhost\n+application.server=remotehost\n+\n+quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://${application.server}:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+----\n+\n+It does result in one more line in this example but the value of `application.server` can be reused in other properties,\n+diminishing the possibility of typos and providing more flexibility in property definitions.\n+\n+\n+[#combine-property-env-var]\n+== Combining Property Expressions and Environment Variables\n+\n+Quarkus also supports the combination of both property expressions and environment variables.\n+\n+Let's assume you have following property defined in `application.properties`:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+remote.host=quarkus.io\n+----\n+\n+You can combine environment variables and property expressions by having a property defined as follows:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+application.host=${HOST:${remote.host}}\n+----\n+\n+This will expand the `HOST` environment variable and use the value of the property `remote.host` as the default value if `HOST` is not set.\n+\n+For the purpose of this section we used the property `remote.host` we defined previously.\n+It has to be noted that the value could have been a fixed one such as in:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+application.host=${HOST:localhost}\n+----\n+\n+which will result in `localhost` as the default value if `HOST` is not set.\n+\n+[[configuring_quarkus]]\n+== Configuring Quarkus\n+\n+Quarkus itself is configured via the same mechanism as your application. Quarkus reserves the `quarkus.` namespace\n+for its own configuration and the configuration of all of its extensions. For example to configure the HTTP server port you can set `quarkus.http.port` in\n+`application.properties`. All the Quarkus configuration properties are link:all-config[documented and searchable].\n+\n+[IMPORTANT]\n+====\n+As mentioned above, properties prefixed with `quarkus.` are effectively reserved for configuring Quarkus itself and\n+therefore `quarkus.` should **never** be used as prefix for application specific properties.\n+\n+In the previous examples using `quarkus.message` instead of `greeting.message` would result in unexpected behavior.\n+====\n+\n+Quarkus does much of its configuration and bootstrap at build time and most configuration properties are read and used during the build.\n+These properties are _fixed at build time_ and it's not possible to change them at runtime.\n+You always need to repackage your application in order to reflect changes of such properties.\n+\n+TIP: The properties fixed at build time are marked with a lock icon (icon:lock[]) in the link:all-config[list of all configuration options].\n+\n+However, some extensions do define properties that can be _overriden at runtime_.\n+A canonical example is the database URL, username and password which is only known specifically in your target environment.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "8db2a006915902929439f7b14ff4b7c998e5fd1c"}, "originalPosition": 484}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMzMxMzQxNjk0OnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "docs/src/main/asciidoc/config-reference.adoc", "isResolved": true, "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0yMlQxNzoxNjo1NVrOH341WA==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0yMlQxNzoxNjo1NVrOH341WA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyODM2NDg4OA==", "bodyText": "This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

To make use of it, `config/application.properties` needs to be placed inside the build tool's output directory (`target` for Maven and `build/classes/java/main` for Gradle).\n+Keep in mind however that any cleaning operation from the build tool like `mvn clean` or `gradle clean` will remove the `config` directory as well.\n+\n+[[application_properties_file]]\n+=== An application configuration file\n+\n+This is the main application configuration file located in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.\n+\n+.Example `application.properties` file\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+greeting.message=hello <1>\n+quarkus.http.port=9090 <2>\n+----\n+<1> This is a user-defind configuration property.\n+<2> This is a configuration property consumed by the `quarkus-vertx-http` extension.\n+\n+TIP: Quarkus supports the use of <<using_property_expressions,property expressions>> in the `application.properties` file.\n+\n+== Injecting configuration properties\n+\n+Quarkus uses https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config] annotations to inject the configuration properties in the application.\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.message\") <1>\n+String message;\n+----\n+<1> You can use `@Inject @ConfigProperty` or just `@ConfigProperty`.\n+The `@Inject` annotation is not necessary for members annotated with `@ConfigProperty`.\n+This behavior differs from https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config].\n+\n+NOTE: If the application attempts to inject a configuration property that is not set, an error is thrown, thus allowing you to quickly know when your configuration is complete.\n+\n+.More `@ConfigProperty` Examples\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.message\") <1>\n+String message;\n+\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.suffix\", defaultValue=\"!\") <2>\n+String suffix;\n+\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.name\")\n+Optional<String> name; <3>\n+----\n+<1> If you do not provide a value for this property, the application startup fails with `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.DeploymentException: No config value of type [class java.lang.String] exists for: greeting.message`.\n+<2> The default value is injected if the configuration does not provide a value for `greeting.suffix`.\n+<3> This property is optional - an empty `Optional` is injected if the configuration does not provide a value for `greeting.name`.\n+\n+== Programmatically access the configuration\n+\n+You can also access the configuration programmatically.\n+It can be handy to achieve dynamic lookup, or retrieve configured values from classes that are neither CDI beans or JAX-RS resources.\n+\n+You can access the configuration programmatically using `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.ConfigProvider.getConfig()` such as in:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+String databaseName = ConfigProvider.getConfig().getValue(\"database.name\", String.class);\n+Optional<String> maybeDatabaseName = ConfigProvider.getConfig().getOptionalValue(\"database.name\", String.class);\n+----\n+\n+[[using_configproperties]]\n+== Using @ConfigProperties\n+\n+As an alternative to injecting multiple related configuration values in the way that was shown in the previous example,\n+users can also use the `@io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties` annotation to group these properties together.\n+\n+For the greeting properties above, a `GreetingConfiguration` class could be created like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+package org.acme.config;\n+\n+import io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties;\n+import java.util.Optional;\n+\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\") <1>\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    private String message;\n+    private String suffix = \"!\"; <2>\n+    private Optional<String> name;\n+\n+    public String getMessage() {\n+        return message;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setMessage(String message) {\n+        this.message = message;\n+    }\n+\n+    public String getSuffix() {\n+        return suffix;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setSuffix(String suffix) {\n+        this.suffix = suffix;\n+    }\n+\n+    public Optional<String> getName() {\n+        return name;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setName(Optional<String> name) {\n+        this.name = name;\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+<1> `prefix` is optional. If not set then the prefix to be used will be determined by the class name. In this case it would still be `greeting` (since the `Configuration` suffix is removed). If the class were named `GreetingExtraConfiguration` then the resulting default prefix would be `greeting-extra`.\n+<2> `!` will be the default value if `greeting.suffix` is not set\n+\n+This class could then be injected into the `GreetingResource` using the familiar CDI `@Inject` annotation like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@Inject\n+GreetingConfiguration greetingConfiguration;\n+----\n+\n+Another alternative style provided by Quarkus is to create `GreetingConfiguration` as an interface like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+package org.acme.config;\n+\n+import io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties;\n+import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.inject.ConfigProperty;\n+import java.util.Optional;\n+\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public interface GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @ConfigProperty(name = \"message\") <1>\n+    String message();\n+\n+    @ConfigProperty(defaultValue = \"!\")\n+    String getSuffix(); <2>\n+\n+    Optional<String> getName(); <3>\n+}\n+----\n+<1> The `@ConfigProperty` annotation is needed because the name of the configuration property that the method corresponds to doesn't follow the getter method naming conventions\n+<2> In this case since `name` was not set, the corresponding property will be `greeting.suffix`.\n+<3> It is unnecessary to specify the `@ConfigProperty` annotation because the method name follows the getter method naming conventions (`greeting.name` being the corresponding property) and no default value is needed.\n+\n+When using `@ConfigProperties` on a class or an interface, if the value of one of its fields is not provided, the application startup will fail and a `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.DeploymentException` indicating the missing value information will be thrown.\n+This does not apply to `Optional` fields and fields with a default value.\n+\n+=== Additional notes on @ConfigProperties\n+\n+When using a regular class annotated with `@ConfigProperties` the class doesn't necessarily have to declare getters and setters.\n+Having simple public non-final fields is valid as well.\n+\n+Furthermore, the configuration classes support nested object configuration. Suppose there was a need to have an extra layer\n+of greeting configuration named `content` that would contain a few fields. This could be achieved like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+    public Optional<String> name;\n+    public ContentConfig content; <1>\n+\n+    public static class ContentConfig {\n+        public Integer prizeAmount;\n+        public List<String> recipients;\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+<1> The name of the field (not the class name) will determine the name of the properties that are bound to the object.\n+\n+Setting the properties would occur in the normal manner, for example in `application.properties` one could have:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+greeting.message = hello\n+greeting.name = quarkus\n+greeting.content.prize-amount=10\n+greeting.content.recipients=Jane,John\n+----\n+\n+Furthermore, classes annotated with `@ConfigProperties` can be annotated with Bean Validation annotations similar to the following example:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @Size(min = 20)\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+\n+}\n+----\n+\n+WARNING: For validation to work, the `quarkus-hibernate-validator` extension needs to be present.\n+\n+If the validation fails with the given configuration, the application will fail to start and indicate the corresponding validation errors in the log.\n+\n+In the case of an interface being annotated with `@ConfigProperties`, the interface is allowed to extend other interfaces and methods from\n+the entire interface hierarchy are used to bind properties.\n+\n+=== Using same ConfigProperties with different prefixes\n+\n+Quarkus also supports the use of the same `@ConfigProperties` object with different prefixes for each injection point using the `io.quarkus.arc.config.@ConfigPrefix` annotation.\n+Say for example that `GreetingConfiguration` from above needs to be used for both the `greeting` prefix and the `other` prefix.\n+In that case the code would look like so:\n+\n+`GreetingConfiguration.java`\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @Size(min = 20)\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+\n+}\n+----\n+\n+`SomeBean.java`\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ApplicationScoped\n+public class SomeBean {\n+\n+    @Inject <1>\n+    GreetingConfiguration greetingConfiguration;\n+\n+    @ConfigPrefix(\"other\") <2>\n+    GreetingConfiguration otherConfiguration;\n+\n+}\n+----\n+<1> At this injection point `greetingConfiguration` will use the `greeting` prefix since that is what has been defined on `@ConfigProperties`.\n+<2> At this injection point `otherConfiguration` will use the `other` prefix from `@ConfigPrefix` instead of the `greeting` prefix. Notice that in this case `@Inject` is not required.\n+\n+[[configuration_profiles]]\n+== Configuration Profiles\n+\n+Quarkus supports the notion of configuration profiles. \n+These allow you to have multiple configurations in the same file and select between them via a profile name.\n+\n+The syntax for this is `%{profile}.config.key=value`. For example if I have the following:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+quarkus.http.port=9090\n+%dev.quarkus.http.port=8181\n+----\n+\n+The Quarkus HTTP port will be 9090, unless the `dev` profile is active, in which case it will be 8181.\n+\n+To use profiles in the `.env` file, you can follow a `_{PROFILE}_CONFIG_KEY=value` pattern. An equivalent of the above example in an `.env` file would be:\n+\n+[source,.env]\n+----\n+QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=9090\n+_DEV_QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=8181\n+----\n+\n+By default Quarkus has three profiles, although it is possible to use as many as you like. \n+The default profiles are:\n+\n+* *dev* - Activated when in development mode (i.e. `quarkus:dev`)\n+* *test* - Activated when running tests\n+* *prod* - The default profile when not running in development or test mode\n+\n+There are two ways to set a custom profile, either via the `quarkus.profile` system property or the `QUARKUS_PROFILE`\n+environment variable. If both are set the system property takes precedence. Note that it is not necessary to\n+define the names of these profiles anywhere, all that is necessary is to create a config property with the profile\n+name, and then set the current profile to that name. For example if I want a `staging` profile with a different HTTP port I can add the following to `application.properties`:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+quarkus.http.port=9090\n+%staging.quarkus.http.port=9999\n+----\n+\n+And then set the `QUARKUS_PROFILE` environment variable to `staging` to activate my profile.\n+\n+[NOTE]\n+====\n+The proper way to check the active profile programmatically is to use the `getActiveProfile` method of `io.quarkus.runtime.configuration.ProfileManager`.\n+\n+Using `@ConfigProperty(\"quarkus.profile\")` will *not* work properly.\n+====\n+\n+=== Default Runtime Profile\n+\n+The default Quarkus application runtime profile is set to the profile used to build the application.\n+For example:\n+[source,bash]\n+----\n+./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.profile=prod-aws\n+./target/my-app-1.0-runner // <1>\n+----\n+<1> The command will run with the `prod-aws` profile. This can be overridden using the `quarkus.profile` system property.\n+\n+\n+[[using_property_expressions]]\n+== Using Property Expressions\n+\n+Quarkus supports the use of property expressions in the `application.properties` file.\n+\n+These expressions are resolved when the property is read.\n+So if your configuration property is a build time configuration property, the property expression will be resolved at build time.\n+If your configuration property is overridable at runtime, the property expression will be resolved at runtime.\n+\n+You can use property expressions both for the Quarkus configuration or for your own configuration properties.\n+\n+Property expressions are defined this way: `${my-property-expression}`.\n+\n+For example, having the following property:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+remote.host=quarkus.io\n+----\n+and another property defined as:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+callable.url=https://${remote.host}/\n+----\n+\n+will result in the value of the `callable.url` property being set to:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+callable.url=https://quarkus.io/\n+----\n+\n+Another example would be defining different database servers depending on the profile used:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+%dev.quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://remotehost:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+----\n+\n+can be simplified by having:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+%dev.application.server=localhost\n+application.server=remotehost\n+\n+quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://${application.server}:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+----\n+\n+It does result in one more line in this example but the value of `application.server` can be reused in other properties,\n+diminishing the possibility of typos and providing more flexibility in property definitions.\n+\n+\n+[#combine-property-env-var]\n+== Combining Property Expressions and Environment Variables\n+\n+Quarkus also supports the combination of both property expressions and environment variables.\n+\n+Let's assume you have following property defined in `application.properties`:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+remote.host=quarkus.io\n+----\n+\n+You can combine environment variables and property expressions by having a property defined as follows:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+application.host=${HOST:${remote.host}}\n+----\n+\n+This will expand the `HOST` environment variable and use the value of the property `remote.host` as the default value if `HOST` is not set.\n+\n+For the purpose of this section we used the property `remote.host` we defined previously.\n+It has to be noted that the value could have been a fixed one such as in:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+application.host=${HOST:localhost}\n+----\n+\n+which will result in `localhost` as the default value if `HOST` is not set.\n+\n+[[configuring_quarkus]]\n+== Configuring Quarkus\n+\n+Quarkus itself is configured via the same mechanism as your application. Quarkus reserves the `quarkus.` namespace\n+for its own configuration and the configuration of all of its extensions. For example to configure the HTTP server port you can set `quarkus.http.port` in\n+`application.properties`. All the Quarkus configuration properties are link:all-config[documented and searchable].\n+\n+[IMPORTANT]\n+====\n+As mentioned above, properties prefixed with `quarkus.` are effectively reserved for configuring Quarkus itself and\n+therefore `quarkus.` should **never** be used as prefix for application specific properties.\n+\n+In the previous examples using `quarkus.message` instead of `greeting.message` would result in unexpected behavior.\n+====\n+\n+Quarkus does much of its configuration and bootstrap at build time and most configuration properties are read and used during the build.\n+These properties are _fixed at build time_ and it's not possible to change them at runtime.\n+You always need to repackage your application in order to reflect changes of such properties.\n+\n+TIP: The properties fixed at build time are marked with a lock icon (icon:lock[]) in the link:all-config[list of all configuration options].\n+\n+However, some extensions do define properties that can be _overriden at runtime_.\n+A canonical example is the database URL, username and password which is only known specifically in your target environment.\n+This is a tradeoff as the more runtime properties are available, the less build time prework Quarkus can do. \n+The list of runtime properties is therefore lean.\n+You can override these runtime properties with the following mechanisms (in decreasing priority) using:\n+\n+1. System properties\n+2. Environment variables\n+3. An environment file named `.env` placed in the current working directory\n+4. A configuration file placed in `$PWD/config/application.properties`\n+\n+See <<configuration_sources>> for more details.\n+\n+== Generating configuration for your application\n+\n+It is also possible to generate an example `application.properties` with all known configuration properties, to make\n+it easy to see what Quarkus configuration options are available. To do this, run:\n+\n+[source,bash]\n+--\n+./mvnw quarkus:generate-config\n+--\n+\n+This will create a `src/main/resources/application.properties.example` file that contains all the config options\n+exposed via the extensions you currently have installed. These options are commented out, and have their default value\n+when applicable. For example this HTTP port config entry will appear as:\n+\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+--\n+#\n+# The HTTP port\n+#\n+#quarkus.http.port=8080\n+--\n+\n+Rather than generating an example config file, you can also add these to you actual config file by setting the `-Dfile`\n+parameter:\n+\n+[source,bash]\n+--\n+./mvnw quarkus:generate-config -Dfile=application.properties\n+--\n+\n+If a config option is already present (commented or not) it will not be added, so it is safe to run this after\n+adding an additional extension to see what additional options have been added.\n+\n+== Clearing properties\n+\n+Run time properties which are optional, and which have had values set at build time or which have a default value,\n+may be explicitly cleared by assigning an empty string to the property.  Note that this will _only_ affect\n+run time properties, and will _only_ work with properties whose values are not required.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "8db2a006915902929439f7b14ff4b7c998e5fd1c"}, "originalPosition": 534}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMzMxMzQyNjU3OnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "docs/src/main/asciidoc/config-reference.adoc", "isResolved": true, "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0yMlQxNzoyNzoxNlrOH346LQ==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0yMlQxNzoyNzoxNlrOH346LQ==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyODM2NjEyNQ==", "bodyText": "This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

To make use of it, `config/application.properties` needs to be placed inside the build tool's output directory (`target` for Maven and `build/classes/java/main` for Gradle).\n+Keep in mind however that any cleaning operation from the build tool like `mvn clean` or `gradle clean` will remove the `config` directory as well.\n+\n+[[application_properties_file]]\n+=== An application configuration file\n+\n+This is the main application configuration file located in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.\n+\n+.Example `application.properties` file\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+greeting.message=hello <1>\n+quarkus.http.port=9090 <2>\n+----\n+<1> This is a user-defind configuration property.\n+<2> This is a configuration property consumed by the `quarkus-vertx-http` extension.\n+\n+TIP: Quarkus supports the use of <<using_property_expressions,property expressions>> in the `application.properties` file.\n+\n+== Injecting configuration properties\n+\n+Quarkus uses https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config] annotations to inject the configuration properties in the application.\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.message\") <1>\n+String message;\n+----\n+<1> You can use `@Inject @ConfigProperty` or just `@ConfigProperty`.\n+The `@Inject` annotation is not necessary for members annotated with `@ConfigProperty`.\n+This behavior differs from https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config].\n+\n+NOTE: If the application attempts to inject a configuration property that is not set, an error is thrown, thus allowing you to quickly know when your configuration is complete.\n+\n+.More `@ConfigProperty` Examples\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.message\") <1>\n+String message;\n+\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.suffix\", defaultValue=\"!\") <2>\n+String suffix;\n+\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.name\")\n+Optional<String> name; <3>\n+----\n+<1> If you do not provide a value for this property, the application startup fails with `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.DeploymentException: No config value of type [class java.lang.String] exists for: greeting.message`.\n+<2> The default value is injected if the configuration does not provide a value for `greeting.suffix`.\n+<3> This property is optional - an empty `Optional` is injected if the configuration does not provide a value for `greeting.name`.\n+\n+== Programmatically access the configuration\n+\n+You can also access the configuration programmatically.\n+It can be handy to achieve dynamic lookup, or retrieve configured values from classes that are neither CDI beans or JAX-RS resources.\n+\n+You can access the configuration programmatically using `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.ConfigProvider.getConfig()` such as in:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+String databaseName = ConfigProvider.getConfig().getValue(\"database.name\", String.class);\n+Optional<String> maybeDatabaseName = ConfigProvider.getConfig().getOptionalValue(\"database.name\", String.class);\n+----\n+\n+[[using_configproperties]]\n+== Using @ConfigProperties\n+\n+As an alternative to injecting multiple related configuration values in the way that was shown in the previous example,\n+users can also use the `@io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties` annotation to group these properties together.\n+\n+For the greeting properties above, a `GreetingConfiguration` class could be created like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+package org.acme.config;\n+\n+import io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties;\n+import java.util.Optional;\n+\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\") <1>\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    private String message;\n+    private String suffix = \"!\"; <2>\n+    private Optional<String> name;\n+\n+    public String getMessage() {\n+        return message;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setMessage(String message) {\n+        this.message = message;\n+    }\n+\n+    public String getSuffix() {\n+        return suffix;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setSuffix(String suffix) {\n+        this.suffix = suffix;\n+    }\n+\n+    public Optional<String> getName() {\n+        return name;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setName(Optional<String> name) {\n+        this.name = name;\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+<1> `prefix` is optional. If not set then the prefix to be used will be determined by the class name. In this case it would still be `greeting` (since the `Configuration` suffix is removed). If the class were named `GreetingExtraConfiguration` then the resulting default prefix would be `greeting-extra`.\n+<2> `!` will be the default value if `greeting.suffix` is not set\n+\n+This class could then be injected into the `GreetingResource` using the familiar CDI `@Inject` annotation like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@Inject\n+GreetingConfiguration greetingConfiguration;\n+----\n+\n+Another alternative style provided by Quarkus is to create `GreetingConfiguration` as an interface like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+package org.acme.config;\n+\n+import io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties;\n+import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.inject.ConfigProperty;\n+import java.util.Optional;\n+\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public interface GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @ConfigProperty(name = \"message\") <1>\n+    String message();\n+\n+    @ConfigProperty(defaultValue = \"!\")\n+    String getSuffix(); <2>\n+\n+    Optional<String> getName(); <3>\n+}\n+----\n+<1> The `@ConfigProperty` annotation is needed because the name of the configuration property that the method corresponds to doesn't follow the getter method naming conventions\n+<2> In this case since `name` was not set, the corresponding property will be `greeting.suffix`.\n+<3> It is unnecessary to specify the `@ConfigProperty` annotation because the method name follows the getter method naming conventions (`greeting.name` being the corresponding property) and no default value is needed.\n+\n+When using `@ConfigProperties` on a class or an interface, if the value of one of its fields is not provided, the application startup will fail and a `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.DeploymentException` indicating the missing value information will be thrown.\n+This does not apply to `Optional` fields and fields with a default value.\n+\n+=== Additional notes on @ConfigProperties\n+\n+When using a regular class annotated with `@ConfigProperties` the class doesn't necessarily have to declare getters and setters.\n+Having simple public non-final fields is valid as well.\n+\n+Furthermore, the configuration classes support nested object configuration. Suppose there was a need to have an extra layer\n+of greeting configuration named `content` that would contain a few fields. This could be achieved like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+    public Optional<String> name;\n+    public ContentConfig content; <1>\n+\n+    public static class ContentConfig {\n+        public Integer prizeAmount;\n+        public List<String> recipients;\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+<1> The name of the field (not the class name) will determine the name of the properties that are bound to the object.\n+\n+Setting the properties would occur in the normal manner, for example in `application.properties` one could have:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+greeting.message = hello\n+greeting.name = quarkus\n+greeting.content.prize-amount=10\n+greeting.content.recipients=Jane,John\n+----\n+\n+Furthermore, classes annotated with `@ConfigProperties` can be annotated with Bean Validation annotations similar to the following example:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @Size(min = 20)\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+\n+}\n+----\n+\n+WARNING: For validation to work, the `quarkus-hibernate-validator` extension needs to be present.\n+\n+If the validation fails with the given configuration, the application will fail to start and indicate the corresponding validation errors in the log.\n+\n+In the case of an interface being annotated with `@ConfigProperties`, the interface is allowed to extend other interfaces and methods from\n+the entire interface hierarchy are used to bind properties.\n+\n+=== Using same ConfigProperties with different prefixes\n+\n+Quarkus also supports the use of the same `@ConfigProperties` object with different prefixes for each injection point using the `io.quarkus.arc.config.@ConfigPrefix` annotation.\n+Say for example that `GreetingConfiguration` from above needs to be used for both the `greeting` prefix and the `other` prefix.\n+In that case the code would look like so:\n+\n+`GreetingConfiguration.java`\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @Size(min = 20)\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+\n+}\n+----\n+\n+`SomeBean.java`\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ApplicationScoped\n+public class SomeBean {\n+\n+    @Inject <1>\n+    GreetingConfiguration greetingConfiguration;\n+\n+    @ConfigPrefix(\"other\") <2>\n+    GreetingConfiguration otherConfiguration;\n+\n+}\n+----\n+<1> At this injection point `greetingConfiguration` will use the `greeting` prefix since that is what has been defined on `@ConfigProperties`.\n+<2> At this injection point `otherConfiguration` will use the `other` prefix from `@ConfigPrefix` instead of the `greeting` prefix. Notice that in this case `@Inject` is not required.\n+\n+[[configuration_profiles]]\n+== Configuration Profiles\n+\n+Quarkus supports the notion of configuration profiles. \n+These allow you to have multiple configurations in the same file and select between them via a profile name.\n+\n+The syntax for this is `%{profile}.config.key=value`. For example if I have the following:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+quarkus.http.port=9090\n+%dev.quarkus.http.port=8181\n+----\n+\n+The Quarkus HTTP port will be 9090, unless the `dev` profile is active, in which case it will be 8181.\n+\n+To use profiles in the `.env` file, you can follow a `_{PROFILE}_CONFIG_KEY=value` pattern. An equivalent of the above example in an `.env` file would be:\n+\n+[source,.env]\n+----\n+QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=9090\n+_DEV_QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=8181\n+----\n+\n+By default Quarkus has three profiles, although it is possible to use as many as you like. \n+The default profiles are:\n+\n+* *dev* - Activated when in development mode (i.e. `quarkus:dev`)\n+* *test* - Activated when running tests\n+* *prod* - The default profile when not running in development or test mode\n+\n+There are two ways to set a custom profile, either via the `quarkus.profile` system property or the `QUARKUS_PROFILE`\n+environment variable. If both are set the system property takes precedence. Note that it is not necessary to\n+define the names of these profiles anywhere, all that is necessary is to create a config property with the profile\n+name, and then set the current profile to that name. For example if I want a `staging` profile with a different HTTP port I can add the following to `application.properties`:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+quarkus.http.port=9090\n+%staging.quarkus.http.port=9999\n+----\n+\n+And then set the `QUARKUS_PROFILE` environment variable to `staging` to activate my profile.\n+\n+[NOTE]\n+====\n+The proper way to check the active profile programmatically is to use the `getActiveProfile` method of `io.quarkus.runtime.configuration.ProfileManager`.\n+\n+Using `@ConfigProperty(\"quarkus.profile\")` will *not* work properly.\n+====\n+\n+=== Default Runtime Profile\n+\n+The default Quarkus application runtime profile is set to the profile used to build the application.\n+For example:\n+[source,bash]\n+----\n+./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.profile=prod-aws\n+./target/my-app-1.0-runner // <1>\n+----\n+<1> The command will run with the `prod-aws` profile. This can be overridden using the `quarkus.profile` system property.\n+\n+\n+[[using_property_expressions]]\n+== Using Property Expressions\n+\n+Quarkus supports the use of property expressions in the `application.properties` file.\n+\n+These expressions are resolved when the property is read.\n+So if your configuration property is a build time configuration property, the property expression will be resolved at build time.\n+If your configuration property is overridable at runtime, the property expression will be resolved at runtime.\n+\n+You can use property expressions both for the Quarkus configuration or for your own configuration properties.\n+\n+Property expressions are defined this way: `${my-property-expression}`.\n+\n+For example, having the following property:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+remote.host=quarkus.io\n+----\n+and another property defined as:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+callable.url=https://${remote.host}/\n+----\n+\n+will result in the value of the `callable.url` property being set to:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+callable.url=https://quarkus.io/\n+----\n+\n+Another example would be defining different database servers depending on the profile used:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+%dev.quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://remotehost:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+----\n+\n+can be simplified by having:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+%dev.application.server=localhost\n+application.server=remotehost\n+\n+quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://${application.server}:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+----\n+\n+It does result in one more line in this example but the value of `application.server` can be reused in other properties,\n+diminishing the possibility of typos and providing more flexibility in property definitions.\n+\n+\n+[#combine-property-env-var]\n+== Combining Property Expressions and Environment Variables\n+\n+Quarkus also supports the combination of both property expressions and environment variables.\n+\n+Let's assume you have following property defined in `application.properties`:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+remote.host=quarkus.io\n+----\n+\n+You can combine environment variables and property expressions by having a property defined as follows:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+application.host=${HOST:${remote.host}}\n+----\n+\n+This will expand the `HOST` environment variable and use the value of the property `remote.host` as the default value if `HOST` is not set.\n+\n+For the purpose of this section we used the property `remote.host` we defined previously.\n+It has to be noted that the value could have been a fixed one such as in:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+application.host=${HOST:localhost}\n+----\n+\n+which will result in `localhost` as the default value if `HOST` is not set.\n+\n+[[configuring_quarkus]]\n+== Configuring Quarkus\n+\n+Quarkus itself is configured via the same mechanism as your application. Quarkus reserves the `quarkus.` namespace\n+for its own configuration and the configuration of all of its extensions. For example to configure the HTTP server port you can set `quarkus.http.port` in\n+`application.properties`. All the Quarkus configuration properties are link:all-config[documented and searchable].\n+\n+[IMPORTANT]\n+====\n+As mentioned above, properties prefixed with `quarkus.` are effectively reserved for configuring Quarkus itself and\n+therefore `quarkus.` should **never** be used as prefix for application specific properties.\n+\n+In the previous examples using `quarkus.message` instead of `greeting.message` would result in unexpected behavior.\n+====\n+\n+Quarkus does much of its configuration and bootstrap at build time and most configuration properties are read and used during the build.\n+These properties are _fixed at build time_ and it's not possible to change them at runtime.\n+You always need to repackage your application in order to reflect changes of such properties.\n+\n+TIP: The properties fixed at build time are marked with a lock icon (icon:lock[]) in the link:all-config[list of all configuration options].\n+\n+However, some extensions do define properties that can be _overriden at runtime_.\n+A canonical example is the database URL, username and password which is only known specifically in your target environment.\n+This is a tradeoff as the more runtime properties are available, the less build time prework Quarkus can do. \n+The list of runtime properties is therefore lean.\n+You can override these runtime properties with the following mechanisms (in decreasing priority) using:\n+\n+1. System properties\n+2. Environment variables\n+3. An environment file named `.env` placed in the current working directory\n+4. A configuration file placed in `$PWD/config/application.properties`\n+\n+See <<configuration_sources>> for more details.\n+\n+== Generating configuration for your application\n+\n+It is also possible to generate an example `application.properties` with all known configuration properties, to make\n+it easy to see what Quarkus configuration options are available. To do this, run:\n+\n+[source,bash]\n+--\n+./mvnw quarkus:generate-config\n+--\n+\n+This will create a `src/main/resources/application.properties.example` file that contains all the config options\n+exposed via the extensions you currently have installed. These options are commented out, and have their default value\n+when applicable. For example this HTTP port config entry will appear as:\n+\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+--\n+#\n+# The HTTP port\n+#\n+#quarkus.http.port=8080\n+--\n+\n+Rather than generating an example config file, you can also add these to you actual config file by setting the `-Dfile`\n+parameter:\n+\n+[source,bash]\n+--\n+./mvnw quarkus:generate-config -Dfile=application.properties\n+--\n+\n+If a config option is already present (commented or not) it will not be added, so it is safe to run this after\n+adding an additional extension to see what additional options have been added.\n+\n+== Clearing properties\n+\n+Run time properties which are optional, and which have had values set at build time or which have a default value,\n+may be explicitly cleared by assigning an empty string to the property.  Note that this will _only_ affect\n+run time properties, and will _only_ work with properties whose values are not required.\n+\n+The property may be cleared by setting the corresponding `application.properties` property, setting the\n+corresponding system property, or setting the corresponding environment variable.\n+\n+[[custom_configuration]]\n+== Custom Configuration\n+\n+=== Custom configuration sources\n+\n+You can also introduce custom configuration sources in the standard MicroProfile Config manner.  To\n+do this, you must provide a class which implements either `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.ConfigSource`\n+or `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.ConfigSourceProvider`.  Create a\n+https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html[service file] for the\n+class and it will be detected and installed at application startup.\n+\n+=== Custom configuration converters\n+\n+You can also use your custom types as a configuration values.

To make use of it, `config/application.properties` needs to be placed inside the build tool's output directory (`target` for Maven and `build/classes/java/main` for Gradle).\n+Keep in mind however that any cleaning operation from the build tool like `mvn clean` or `gradle clean` will remove the `config` directory as well.\n+\n+[[application_properties_file]]\n+=== An application configuration file\n+\n+This is the main application configuration file located in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.\n+\n+.Example `application.properties` file\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+greeting.message=hello <1>\n+quarkus.http.port=9090 <2>\n+----\n+<1> This is a user-defind configuration property.\n+<2> This is a configuration property consumed by the `quarkus-vertx-http` extension.\n+\n+TIP: Quarkus supports the use of <<using_property_expressions,property expressions>> in the `application.properties` file.\n+\n+== Injecting configuration properties\n+\n+Quarkus uses https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config] annotations to inject the configuration properties in the application.\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.message\") <1>\n+String message;\n+----\n+<1> You can use `@Inject @ConfigProperty` or just `@ConfigProperty`.\n+The `@Inject` annotation is not necessary for members annotated with `@ConfigProperty`.\n+This behavior differs from https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config].\n+\n+NOTE: If the application attempts to inject a configuration property that is not set, an error is thrown, thus allowing you to quickly know when your configuration is complete.\n+\n+.More `@ConfigProperty` Examples\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.message\") <1>\n+String message;\n+\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.suffix\", defaultValue=\"!\") <2>\n+String suffix;\n+\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.name\")\n+Optional<String> name; <3>\n+----\n+<1> If you do not provide a value for this property, the application startup fails with `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.DeploymentException: No config value of type [class java.lang.String] exists for: greeting.message`.\n+<2> The default value is injected if the configuration does not provide a value for `greeting.suffix`.\n+<3> This property is optional - an empty `Optional` is injected if the configuration does not provide a value for `greeting.name`.\n+\n+== Programmatically access the configuration\n+\n+You can also access the configuration programmatically.\n+It can be handy to achieve dynamic lookup, or retrieve configured values from classes that are neither CDI beans or JAX-RS resources.\n+\n+You can access the configuration programmatically using `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.ConfigProvider.getConfig()` such as in:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+String databaseName = ConfigProvider.getConfig().getValue(\"database.name\", String.class);\n+Optional<String> maybeDatabaseName = ConfigProvider.getConfig().getOptionalValue(\"database.name\", String.class);\n+----\n+\n+[[using_configproperties]]\n+== Using @ConfigProperties\n+\n+As an alternative to injecting multiple related configuration values in the way that was shown in the previous example,\n+users can also use the `@io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties` annotation to group these properties together.\n+\n+For the greeting properties above, a `GreetingConfiguration` class could be created like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+package org.acme.config;\n+\n+import io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties;\n+import java.util.Optional;\n+\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\") <1>\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    private String message;\n+    private String suffix = \"!\"; <2>\n+    private Optional<String> name;\n+\n+    public String getMessage() {\n+        return message;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setMessage(String message) {\n+        this.message = message;\n+    }\n+\n+    public String getSuffix() {\n+        return suffix;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setSuffix(String suffix) {\n+        this.suffix = suffix;\n+    }\n+\n+    public Optional<String> getName() {\n+        return name;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setName(Optional<String> name) {\n+        this.name = name;\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+<1> `prefix` is optional. If not set then the prefix to be used will be determined by the class name. In this case it would still be `greeting` (since the `Configuration` suffix is removed). If the class were named `GreetingExtraConfiguration` then the resulting default prefix would be `greeting-extra`.\n+<2> `!` will be the default value if `greeting.suffix` is not set\n+\n+This class could then be injected into the `GreetingResource` using the familiar CDI `@Inject` annotation like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@Inject\n+GreetingConfiguration greetingConfiguration;\n+----\n+\n+Another alternative style provided by Quarkus is to create `GreetingConfiguration` as an interface like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+package org.acme.config;\n+\n+import io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties;\n+import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.inject.ConfigProperty;\n+import java.util.Optional;\n+\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public interface GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @ConfigProperty(name = \"message\") <1>\n+    String message();\n+\n+    @ConfigProperty(defaultValue = \"!\")\n+    String getSuffix(); <2>\n+\n+    Optional<String> getName(); <3>\n+}\n+----\n+<1> The `@ConfigProperty` annotation is needed because the name of the configuration property that the method corresponds to doesn't follow the getter method naming conventions\n+<2> In this case since `name` was not set, the corresponding property will be `greeting.suffix`.\n+<3> It is unnecessary to specify the `@ConfigProperty` annotation because the method name follows the getter method naming conventions (`greeting.name` being the corresponding property) and no default value is needed.\n+\n+When using `@ConfigProperties` on a class or an interface, if the value of one of its fields is not provided, the application startup will fail and a `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.DeploymentException` indicating the missing value information will be thrown.\n+This does not apply to `Optional` fields and fields with a default value.\n+\n+=== Additional notes on @ConfigProperties\n+\n+When using a regular class annotated with `@ConfigProperties` the class doesn't necessarily have to declare getters and setters.\n+Having simple public non-final fields is valid as well.\n+\n+Furthermore, the configuration classes support nested object configuration. Suppose there was a need to have an extra layer\n+of greeting configuration named `content` that would contain a few fields. This could be achieved like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+    public Optional<String> name;\n+    public ContentConfig content; <1>\n+\n+    public static class ContentConfig {\n+        public Integer prizeAmount;\n+        public List<String> recipients;\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+<1> The name of the field (not the class name) will determine the name of the properties that are bound to the object.\n+\n+Setting the properties would occur in the normal manner, for example in `application.properties` one could have:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+greeting.message = hello\n+greeting.name = quarkus\n+greeting.content.prize-amount=10\n+greeting.content.recipients=Jane,John\n+----\n+\n+Furthermore, classes annotated with `@ConfigProperties` can be annotated with Bean Validation annotations similar to the following example:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @Size(min = 20)\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+\n+}\n+----\n+\n+WARNING: For validation to work, the `quarkus-hibernate-validator` extension needs to be present.\n+\n+If the validation fails with the given configuration, the application will fail to start and indicate the corresponding validation errors in the log.\n+\n+In the case of an interface being annotated with `@ConfigProperties`, the interface is allowed to extend other interfaces and methods from\n+the entire interface hierarchy are used to bind properties.\n+\n+=== Using same ConfigProperties with different prefixes\n+\n+Quarkus also supports the use of the same `@ConfigProperties` object with different prefixes for each injection point using the `io.quarkus.arc.config.@ConfigPrefix` annotation.\n+Say for example that `GreetingConfiguration` from above needs to be used for both the `greeting` prefix and the `other` prefix.\n+In that case the code would look like so:\n+\n+`GreetingConfiguration.java`\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @Size(min = 20)\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+\n+}\n+----\n+\n+`SomeBean.java`\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ApplicationScoped\n+public class SomeBean {\n+\n+    @Inject <1>\n+    GreetingConfiguration greetingConfiguration;\n+\n+    @ConfigPrefix(\"other\") <2>\n+    GreetingConfiguration otherConfiguration;\n+\n+}\n+----\n+<1> At this injection point `greetingConfiguration` will use the `greeting` prefix since that is what has been defined on `@ConfigProperties`.\n+<2> At this injection point `otherConfiguration` will use the `other` prefix from `@ConfigPrefix` instead of the `greeting` prefix. Notice that in this case `@Inject` is not required.\n+\n+[[configuration_profiles]]\n+== Configuration Profiles\n+\n+Quarkus supports the notion of configuration profiles. \n+These allow you to have multiple configurations in the same file and select between them via a profile name.\n+\n+The syntax for this is `%{profile}.config.key=value`. For example if I have the following:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+quarkus.http.port=9090\n+%dev.quarkus.http.port=8181\n+----\n+\n+The Quarkus HTTP port will be 9090, unless the `dev` profile is active, in which case it will be 8181.\n+\n+To use profiles in the `.env` file, you can follow a `_{PROFILE}_CONFIG_KEY=value` pattern. An equivalent of the above example in an `.env` file would be:\n+\n+[source,.env]\n+----\n+QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=9090\n+_DEV_QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=8181\n+----\n+\n+By default Quarkus has three profiles, although it is possible to use as many as you like. \n+The default profiles are:\n+\n+* *dev* - Activated when in development mode (i.e. `quarkus:dev`)\n+* *test* - Activated when running tests\n+* *prod* - The default profile when not running in development or test mode\n+\n+There are two ways to set a custom profile, either via the `quarkus.profile` system property or the `QUARKUS_PROFILE`\n+environment variable. If both are set the system property takes precedence. Note that it is not necessary to\n+define the names of these profiles anywhere, all that is necessary is to create a config property with the profile\n+name, and then set the current profile to that name. For example if I want a `staging` profile with a different HTTP port I can add the following to `application.properties`:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+quarkus.http.port=9090\n+%staging.quarkus.http.port=9999\n+----\n+\n+And then set the `QUARKUS_PROFILE` environment variable to `staging` to activate my profile.\n+\n+[NOTE]\n+====\n+The proper way to check the active profile programmatically is to use the `getActiveProfile` method of `io.quarkus.runtime.configuration.ProfileManager`.\n+\n+Using `@ConfigProperty(\"quarkus.profile\")` will *not* work properly.\n+====\n+\n+=== Default Runtime Profile\n+\n+The default Quarkus application runtime profile is set to the profile used to build the application.\n+For example:\n+[source,bash]\n+----\n+./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.profile=prod-aws\n+./target/my-app-1.0-runner // <1>\n+----\n+<1> The command will run with the `prod-aws` profile. This can be overridden using the `quarkus.profile` system property.\n+\n+\n+[[using_property_expressions]]\n+== Using Property Expressions\n+\n+Quarkus supports the use of property expressions in the `application.properties` file.\n+\n+These expressions are resolved when the property is read.\n+So if your configuration property is a build time configuration property, the property expression will be resolved at build time.\n+If your configuration property is overridable at runtime, the property expression will be resolved at runtime.\n+\n+You can use property expressions both for the Quarkus configuration or for your own configuration properties.\n+\n+Property expressions are defined this way: `${my-property-expression}`.\n+\n+For example, having the following property:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+remote.host=quarkus.io\n+----\n+and another property defined as:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+callable.url=https://${remote.host}/\n+----\n+\n+will result in the value of the `callable.url` property being set to:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+callable.url=https://quarkus.io/\n+----\n+\n+Another example would be defining different database servers depending on the profile used:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+%dev.quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://remotehost:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+----\n+\n+can be simplified by having:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+%dev.application.server=localhost\n+application.server=remotehost\n+\n+quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://${application.server}:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+----\n+\n+It does result in one more line in this example but the value of `application.server` can be reused in other properties,\n+diminishing the possibility of typos and providing more flexibility in property definitions.\n+\n+\n+[#combine-property-env-var]\n+== Combining Property Expressions and Environment Variables\n+\n+Quarkus also supports the combination of both property expressions and environment variables.\n+\n+Let's assume you have following property defined in `application.properties`:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+remote.host=quarkus.io\n+----\n+\n+You can combine environment variables and property expressions by having a property defined as follows:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+application.host=${HOST:${remote.host}}\n+----\n+\n+This will expand the `HOST` environment variable and use the value of the property `remote.host` as the default value if `HOST` is not set.\n+\n+For the purpose of this section we used the property `remote.host` we defined previously.\n+It has to be noted that the value could have been a fixed one such as in:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+application.host=${HOST:localhost}\n+----\n+\n+which will result in `localhost` as the default value if `HOST` is not set.\n+\n+[[configuring_quarkus]]\n+== Configuring Quarkus\n+\n+Quarkus itself is configured via the same mechanism as your application. Quarkus reserves the `quarkus.` namespace\n+for its own configuration and the configuration of all of its extensions. For example to configure the HTTP server port you can set `quarkus.http.port` in\n+`application.properties`. All the Quarkus configuration properties are link:all-config[documented and searchable].\n+\n+[IMPORTANT]\n+====\n+As mentioned above, properties prefixed with `quarkus.` are effectively reserved for configuring Quarkus itself and\n+therefore `quarkus.` should **never** be used as prefix for application specific properties.\n+\n+In the previous examples using `quarkus.message` instead of `greeting.message` would result in unexpected behavior.\n+====\n+\n+Quarkus does much of its configuration and bootstrap at build time and most configuration properties are read and used during the build.\n+These properties are _fixed at build time_ and it's not possible to change them at runtime.\n+You always need to repackage your application in order to reflect changes of such properties.\n+\n+TIP: The properties fixed at build time are marked with a lock icon (icon:lock[]) in the link:all-config[list of all configuration options].\n+\n+However, some extensions do define properties that can be _overriden at runtime_.\n+A canonical example is the database URL, username and password which is only known specifically in your target environment.\n+This is a tradeoff as the more runtime properties are available, the less build time prework Quarkus can do. \n+The list of runtime properties is therefore lean.\n+You can override these runtime properties with the following mechanisms (in decreasing priority) using:\n+\n+1. System properties\n+2. Environment variables\n+3. An environment file named `.env` placed in the current working directory\n+4. A configuration file placed in `$PWD/config/application.properties`\n+\n+See <<configuration_sources>> for more details.\n+\n+== Generating configuration for your application\n+\n+It is also possible to generate an example `application.properties` with all known configuration properties, to make\n+it easy to see what Quarkus configuration options are available. To do this, run:\n+\n+[source,bash]\n+--\n+./mvnw quarkus:generate-config\n+--\n+\n+This will create a `src/main/resources/application.properties.example` file that contains all the config options\n+exposed via the extensions you currently have installed. These options are commented out, and have their default value\n+when applicable. For example this HTTP port config entry will appear as:\n+\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+--\n+#\n+# The HTTP port\n+#\n+#quarkus.http.port=8080\n+--\n+\n+Rather than generating an example config file, you can also add these to you actual config file by setting the `-Dfile`\n+parameter:\n+\n+[source,bash]\n+--\n+./mvnw quarkus:generate-config -Dfile=application.properties\n+--\n+\n+If a config option is already present (commented or not) it will not be added, so it is safe to run this after\n+adding an additional extension to see what additional options have been added.\n+\n+== Clearing properties\n+\n+Run time properties which are optional, and which have had values set at build time or which have a default value,\n+may be explicitly cleared by assigning an empty string to the property.  Note that this will _only_ affect\n+run time properties, and will _only_ work with properties whose values are not required.\n+\n+The property may be cleared by setting the corresponding `application.properties` property, setting the\n+corresponding system property, or setting the corresponding environment variable.\n+\n+[[custom_configuration]]\n+== Custom Configuration\n+\n+=== Custom configuration sources\n+\n+You can also introduce custom configuration sources in the standard MicroProfile Config manner.  To\n+do this, you must provide a class which implements either `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.ConfigSource`\n+or `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.ConfigSourceProvider`.  Create a\n+https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html[service file] for the\n+class and it will be detected and installed at application startup.\n+\n+=== Custom configuration converters\n+\n+You can also use your custom types as a configuration values. This can be done by implementing `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter<T>`\n+and adding its fully qualified class name in the `META-INF/services/org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter` file.\n+\n+Let us assume you have a custom type like this one:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+package org.acme.config;\n+\n+public class MicroProfileCustomValue {\n+\n+    private final int number;\n+\n+    public MicroProfileCustomValue(int number) {\n+        this.number = number;\n+    }\n+\n+    public int getNumber() {\n+        return number;\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+\n+The corresponding converter will look like the one below. Please note that your custom converter class must be `public` and must have\n+a `public` no-argument constructor. It also must not be `abstract`.\n+\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+package org.acme.config;\n+\n+import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter;\n+\n+public class MicroProfileCustomValueConverter implements Converter<MicroProfileCustomValue> {\n+\n+    @Override\n+    public MicroProfileCustomValue convert(String value) {\n+        return new MicroProfileCustomValue(Integer.valueOf(value));\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+\n+Then you need to include the fully qualified class name of the converter in a service file `META-INF/services/org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter`.\n+If you have more converters, simply add their class names in this file as well.

To make use of it, `config/application.properties` needs to be placed inside the build tool's output directory (`target` for Maven and `build/classes/java/main` for Gradle).\n+Keep in mind however that any cleaning operation from the build tool like `mvn clean` or `gradle clean` will remove the `config` directory as well.\n+\n+[[application_properties_file]]\n+=== An application configuration file\n+\n+This is the main application configuration file located in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.\n+\n+.Example `application.properties` file\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+greeting.message=hello <1>\n+quarkus.http.port=9090 <2>\n+----\n+<1> This is a user-defind configuration property.\n+<2> This is a configuration property consumed by the `quarkus-vertx-http` extension.\n+\n+TIP: Quarkus supports the use of <<using_property_expressions,property expressions>> in the `application.properties` file.\n+\n+== Injecting configuration properties\n+\n+Quarkus uses https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config] annotations to inject the configuration properties in the application.\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.message\") <1>\n+String message;\n+----\n+<1> You can use `@Inject @ConfigProperty` or just `@ConfigProperty`.\n+The `@Inject` annotation is not necessary for members annotated with `@ConfigProperty`.\n+This behavior differs from https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config].\n+\n+NOTE: If the application attempts to inject a configuration property that is not set, an error is thrown, thus allowing you to quickly know when your configuration is complete.\n+\n+.More `@ConfigProperty` Examples\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.message\") <1>\n+String message;\n+\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.suffix\", defaultValue=\"!\") <2>\n+String suffix;\n+\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.name\")\n+Optional<String> name; <3>\n+----\n+<1> If you do not provide a value for this property, the application startup fails with `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.DeploymentException: No config value of type [class java.lang.String] exists for: greeting.message`.\n+<2> The default value is injected if the configuration does not provide a value for `greeting.suffix`.\n+<3> This property is optional - an empty `Optional` is injected if the configuration does not provide a value for `greeting.name`.\n+\n+== Programmatically access the configuration\n+\n+You can also access the configuration programmatically.\n+It can be handy to achieve dynamic lookup, or retrieve configured values from classes that are neither CDI beans or JAX-RS resources.\n+\n+You can access the configuration programmatically using `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.ConfigProvider.getConfig()` such as in:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+String databaseName = ConfigProvider.getConfig().getValue(\"database.name\", String.class);\n+Optional<String> maybeDatabaseName = ConfigProvider.getConfig().getOptionalValue(\"database.name\", String.class);\n+----\n+\n+[[using_configproperties]]\n+== Using @ConfigProperties\n+\n+As an alternative to injecting multiple related configuration values in the way that was shown in the previous example,\n+users can also use the `@io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties` annotation to group these properties together.\n+\n+For the greeting properties above, a `GreetingConfiguration` class could be created like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+package org.acme.config;\n+\n+import io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties;\n+import java.util.Optional;\n+\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\") <1>\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    private String message;\n+    private String suffix = \"!\"; <2>\n+    private Optional<String> name;\n+\n+    public String getMessage() {\n+        return message;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setMessage(String message) {\n+        this.message = message;\n+    }\n+\n+    public String getSuffix() {\n+        return suffix;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setSuffix(String suffix) {\n+        this.suffix = suffix;\n+    }\n+\n+    public Optional<String> getName() {\n+        return name;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setName(Optional<String> name) {\n+        this.name = name;\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+<1> `prefix` is optional. If not set then the prefix to be used will be determined by the class name. In this case it would still be `greeting` (since the `Configuration` suffix is removed). If the class were named `GreetingExtraConfiguration` then the resulting default prefix would be `greeting-extra`.\n+<2> `!` will be the default value if `greeting.suffix` is not set\n+\n+This class could then be injected into the `GreetingResource` using the familiar CDI `@Inject` annotation like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@Inject\n+GreetingConfiguration greetingConfiguration;\n+----\n+\n+Another alternative style provided by Quarkus is to create `GreetingConfiguration` as an interface like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+package org.acme.config;\n+\n+import io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties;\n+import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.inject.ConfigProperty;\n+import java.util.Optional;\n+\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public interface GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @ConfigProperty(name = \"message\") <1>\n+    String message();\n+\n+    @ConfigProperty(defaultValue = \"!\")\n+    String getSuffix(); <2>\n+\n+    Optional<String> getName(); <3>\n+}\n+----\n+<1> The `@ConfigProperty` annotation is needed because the name of the configuration property that the method corresponds to doesn't follow the getter method naming conventions\n+<2> In this case since `name` was not set, the corresponding property will be `greeting.suffix`.\n+<3> It is unnecessary to specify the `@ConfigProperty` annotation because the method name follows the getter method naming conventions (`greeting.name` being the corresponding property) and no default value is needed.\n+\n+When using `@ConfigProperties` on a class or an interface, if the value of one of its fields is not provided, the application startup will fail and a `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.DeploymentException` indicating the missing value information will be thrown.\n+This does not apply to `Optional` fields and fields with a default value.\n+\n+=== Additional notes on @ConfigProperties\n+\n+When using a regular class annotated with `@ConfigProperties` the class doesn't necessarily have to declare getters and setters.\n+Having simple public non-final fields is valid as well.\n+\n+Furthermore, the configuration classes support nested object configuration. Suppose there was a need to have an extra layer\n+of greeting configuration named `content` that would contain a few fields. This could be achieved like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+    public Optional<String> name;\n+    public ContentConfig content; <1>\n+\n+    public static class ContentConfig {\n+        public Integer prizeAmount;\n+        public List<String> recipients;\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+<1> The name of the field (not the class name) will determine the name of the properties that are bound to the object.\n+\n+Setting the properties would occur in the normal manner, for example in `application.properties` one could have:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+greeting.message = hello\n+greeting.name = quarkus\n+greeting.content.prize-amount=10\n+greeting.content.recipients=Jane,John\n+----\n+\n+Furthermore, classes annotated with `@ConfigProperties` can be annotated with Bean Validation annotations similar to the following example:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @Size(min = 20)\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+\n+}\n+----\n+\n+WARNING: For validation to work, the `quarkus-hibernate-validator` extension needs to be present.\n+\n+If the validation fails with the given configuration, the application will fail to start and indicate the corresponding validation errors in the log.\n+\n+In the case of an interface being annotated with `@ConfigProperties`, the interface is allowed to extend other interfaces and methods from\n+the entire interface hierarchy are used to bind properties.\n+\n+=== Using same ConfigProperties with different prefixes\n+\n+Quarkus also supports the use of the same `@ConfigProperties` object with different prefixes for each injection point using the `io.quarkus.arc.config.@ConfigPrefix` annotation.\n+Say for example that `GreetingConfiguration` from above needs to be used for both the `greeting` prefix and the `other` prefix.\n+In that case the code would look like so:\n+\n+`GreetingConfiguration.java`\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @Size(min = 20)\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+\n+}\n+----\n+\n+`SomeBean.java`\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ApplicationScoped\n+public class SomeBean {\n+\n+    @Inject <1>\n+    GreetingConfiguration greetingConfiguration;\n+\n+    @ConfigPrefix(\"other\") <2>\n+    GreetingConfiguration otherConfiguration;\n+\n+}\n+----\n+<1> At this injection point `greetingConfiguration` will use the `greeting` prefix since that is what has been defined on `@ConfigProperties`.\n+<2> At this injection point `otherConfiguration` will use the `other` prefix from `@ConfigPrefix` instead of the `greeting` prefix. Notice that in this case `@Inject` is not required.\n+\n+[[configuration_profiles]]\n+== Configuration Profiles\n+\n+Quarkus supports the notion of configuration profiles. \n+These allow you to have multiple configurations in the same file and select between them via a profile name.\n+\n+The syntax for this is `%{profile}.config.key=value`. For example if I have the following:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+quarkus.http.port=9090\n+%dev.quarkus.http.port=8181\n+----\n+\n+The Quarkus HTTP port will be 9090, unless the `dev` profile is active, in which case it will be 8181.\n+\n+To use profiles in the `.env` file, you can follow a `_{PROFILE}_CONFIG_KEY=value` pattern. An equivalent of the above example in an `.env` file would be:\n+\n+[source,.env]\n+----\n+QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=9090\n+_DEV_QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=8181\n+----\n+\n+By default Quarkus has three profiles, although it is possible to use as many as you like. \n+The default profiles are:\n+\n+* *dev* - Activated when in development mode (i.e. `quarkus:dev`)\n+* *test* - Activated when running tests\n+* *prod* - The default profile when not running in development or test mode\n+\n+There are two ways to set a custom profile, either via the `quarkus.profile` system property or the `QUARKUS_PROFILE`\n+environment variable. If both are set the system property takes precedence. Note that it is not necessary to\n+define the names of these profiles anywhere, all that is necessary is to create a config property with the profile\n+name, and then set the current profile to that name. For example if I want a `staging` profile with a different HTTP port I can add the following to `application.properties`:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+quarkus.http.port=9090\n+%staging.quarkus.http.port=9999\n+----\n+\n+And then set the `QUARKUS_PROFILE` environment variable to `staging` to activate my profile.\n+\n+[NOTE]\n+====\n+The proper way to check the active profile programmatically is to use the `getActiveProfile` method of `io.quarkus.runtime.configuration.ProfileManager`.\n+\n+Using `@ConfigProperty(\"quarkus.profile\")` will *not* work properly.\n+====\n+\n+=== Default Runtime Profile\n+\n+The default Quarkus application runtime profile is set to the profile used to build the application.\n+For example:\n+[source,bash]\n+----\n+./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.profile=prod-aws\n+./target/my-app-1.0-runner // <1>\n+----\n+<1> The command will run with the `prod-aws` profile. This can be overridden using the `quarkus.profile` system property.\n+\n+\n+[[using_property_expressions]]\n+== Using Property Expressions\n+\n+Quarkus supports the use of property expressions in the `application.properties` file.\n+\n+These expressions are resolved when the property is read.\n+So if your configuration property is a build time configuration property, the property expression will be resolved at build time.\n+If your configuration property is overridable at runtime, the property expression will be resolved at runtime.\n+\n+You can use property expressions both for the Quarkus configuration or for your own configuration properties.\n+\n+Property expressions are defined this way: `${my-property-expression}`.\n+\n+For example, having the following property:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+remote.host=quarkus.io\n+----\n+and another property defined as:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+callable.url=https://${remote.host}/\n+----\n+\n+will result in the value of the `callable.url` property being set to:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+callable.url=https://quarkus.io/\n+----\n+\n+Another example would be defining different database servers depending on the profile used:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+%dev.quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://remotehost:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+----\n+\n+can be simplified by having:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+%dev.application.server=localhost\n+application.server=remotehost\n+\n+quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://${application.server}:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+----\n+\n+It does result in one more line in this example but the value of `application.server` can be reused in other properties,\n+diminishing the possibility of typos and providing more flexibility in property definitions.\n+\n+\n+[#combine-property-env-var]\n+== Combining Property Expressions and Environment Variables\n+\n+Quarkus also supports the combination of both property expressions and environment variables.\n+\n+Let's assume you have following property defined in `application.properties`:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+remote.host=quarkus.io\n+----\n+\n+You can combine environment variables and property expressions by having a property defined as follows:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+application.host=${HOST:${remote.host}}\n+----\n+\n+This will expand the `HOST` environment variable and use the value of the property `remote.host` as the default value if `HOST` is not set.\n+\n+For the purpose of this section we used the property `remote.host` we defined previously.\n+It has to be noted that the value could have been a fixed one such as in:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+application.host=${HOST:localhost}\n+----\n+\n+which will result in `localhost` as the default value if `HOST` is not set.\n+\n+[[configuring_quarkus]]\n+== Configuring Quarkus\n+\n+Quarkus itself is configured via the same mechanism as your application. Quarkus reserves the `quarkus.` namespace\n+for its own configuration and the configuration of all of its extensions. For example to configure the HTTP server port you can set `quarkus.http.port` in\n+`application.properties`. All the Quarkus configuration properties are link:all-config[documented and searchable].\n+\n+[IMPORTANT]\n+====\n+As mentioned above, properties prefixed with `quarkus.` are effectively reserved for configuring Quarkus itself and\n+therefore `quarkus.` should **never** be used as prefix for application specific properties.\n+\n+In the previous examples using `quarkus.message` instead of `greeting.message` would result in unexpected behavior.\n+====\n+\n+Quarkus does much of its configuration and bootstrap at build time and most configuration properties are read and used during the build.\n+These properties are _fixed at build time_ and it's not possible to change them at runtime.\n+You always need to repackage your application in order to reflect changes of such properties.\n+\n+TIP: The properties fixed at build time are marked with a lock icon (icon:lock[]) in the link:all-config[list of all configuration options].\n+\n+However, some extensions do define properties that can be _overriden at runtime_.\n+A canonical example is the database URL, username and password which is only known specifically in your target environment.\n+This is a tradeoff as the more runtime properties are available, the less build time prework Quarkus can do. \n+The list of runtime properties is therefore lean.\n+You can override these runtime properties with the following mechanisms (in decreasing priority) using:\n+\n+1. System properties\n+2. Environment variables\n+3. An environment file named `.env` placed in the current working directory\n+4. A configuration file placed in `$PWD/config/application.properties`\n+\n+See <<configuration_sources>> for more details.\n+\n+== Generating configuration for your application\n+\n+It is also possible to generate an example `application.properties` with all known configuration properties, to make\n+it easy to see what Quarkus configuration options are available. To do this, run:\n+\n+[source,bash]\n+--\n+./mvnw quarkus:generate-config\n+--\n+\n+This will create a `src/main/resources/application.properties.example` file that contains all the config options\n+exposed via the extensions you currently have installed. These options are commented out, and have their default value\n+when applicable. For example this HTTP port config entry will appear as:\n+\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+--\n+#\n+# The HTTP port\n+#\n+#quarkus.http.port=8080\n+--\n+\n+Rather than generating an example config file, you can also add these to you actual config file by setting the `-Dfile`\n+parameter:\n+\n+[source,bash]\n+--\n+./mvnw quarkus:generate-config -Dfile=application.properties\n+--\n+\n+If a config option is already present (commented or not) it will not be added, so it is safe to run this after\n+adding an additional extension to see what additional options have been added.\n+\n+== Clearing properties\n+\n+Run time properties which are optional, and which have had values set at build time or which have a default value,\n+may be explicitly cleared by assigning an empty string to the property.  Note that this will _only_ affect\n+run time properties, and will _only_ work with properties whose values are not required.\n+\n+The property may be cleared by setting the corresponding `application.properties` property, setting the\n+corresponding system property, or setting the corresponding environment variable.\n+\n+[[custom_configuration]]\n+== Custom Configuration\n+\n+=== Custom configuration sources\n+\n+You can also introduce custom configuration sources in the standard MicroProfile Config manner.  To\n+do this, you must provide a class which implements either `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.ConfigSource`\n+or `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.ConfigSourceProvider`.  Create a\n+https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html[service file] for the\n+class and it will be detected and installed at application startup.\n+\n+=== Custom configuration converters\n+\n+You can also use your custom types as a configuration values. This can be done by implementing `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter<T>`\n+and adding its fully qualified class name in the `META-INF/services/org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter` file.\n+\n+Let us assume you have a custom type like this one:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+package org.acme.config;\n+\n+public class MicroProfileCustomValue {\n+\n+    private final int number;\n+\n+    public MicroProfileCustomValue(int number) {\n+        this.number = number;\n+    }\n+\n+    public int getNumber() {\n+        return number;\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+\n+The corresponding converter will look like the one below. Please note that your custom converter class must be `public` and must have\n+a `public` no-argument constructor. It also must not be `abstract`.\n+\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+package org.acme.config;\n+\n+import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter;\n+\n+public class MicroProfileCustomValueConverter implements Converter<MicroProfileCustomValue> {\n+\n+    @Override\n+    public MicroProfileCustomValue convert(String value) {\n+        return new MicroProfileCustomValue(Integer.valueOf(value));\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+\n+Then you need to include the fully qualified class name of the converter in a service file `META-INF/services/org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter`.\n+If you have more converters, simply add their class names in this file as well. Single fully qualified class name per line, for example:\n+\n+[source]\n+----\n+org.acme.config.MicroProfileCustomValueConverter\n+org.acme.config.SomeOtherConverter\n+org.acme.config.YetAnotherConverter\n+----\n+\n+Please note that `SomeOtherConverter` and `YetAnotherConverter` were added just for a demonstration.

To make use of it, `config/application.properties` needs to be placed inside the build tool's output directory (`target` for Maven and `build/classes/java/main` for Gradle).\n+Keep in mind however that any cleaning operation from the build tool like `mvn clean` or `gradle clean` will remove the `config` directory as well.\n+\n+[[application_properties_file]]\n+=== An application configuration file\n+\n+This is the main application configuration file located in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.\n+\n+.Example `application.properties` file\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+greeting.message=hello <1>\n+quarkus.http.port=9090 <2>\n+----\n+<1> This is a user-defind configuration property.\n+<2> This is a configuration property consumed by the `quarkus-vertx-http` extension.\n+\n+TIP: Quarkus supports the use of <<using_property_expressions,property expressions>> in the `application.properties` file.\n+\n+== Injecting configuration properties\n+\n+Quarkus uses https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config] annotations to inject the configuration properties in the application.\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.message\") <1>\n+String message;\n+----\n+<1> You can use `@Inject @ConfigProperty` or just `@ConfigProperty`.\n+The `@Inject` annotation is not necessary for members annotated with `@ConfigProperty`.\n+This behavior differs from https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config].\n+\n+NOTE: If the application attempts to inject a configuration property that is not set, an error is thrown, thus allowing you to quickly know when your configuration is complete.\n+\n+.More `@ConfigProperty` Examples\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.message\") <1>\n+String message;\n+\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.suffix\", defaultValue=\"!\") <2>\n+String suffix;\n+\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.name\")\n+Optional<String> name; <3>\n+----\n+<1> If you do not provide a value for this property, the application startup fails with `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.DeploymentException: No config value of type [class java.lang.String] exists for: greeting.message`.\n+<2> The default value is injected if the configuration does not provide a value for `greeting.suffix`.\n+<3> This property is optional - an empty `Optional` is injected if the configuration does not provide a value for `greeting.name`.\n+\n+== Programmatically access the configuration\n+\n+You can also access the configuration programmatically.\n+It can be handy to achieve dynamic lookup, or retrieve configured values from classes that are neither CDI beans or JAX-RS resources.\n+\n+You can access the configuration programmatically using `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.ConfigProvider.getConfig()` such as in:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+String databaseName = ConfigProvider.getConfig().getValue(\"database.name\", String.class);\n+Optional<String> maybeDatabaseName = ConfigProvider.getConfig().getOptionalValue(\"database.name\", String.class);\n+----\n+\n+[[using_configproperties]]\n+== Using @ConfigProperties\n+\n+As an alternative to injecting multiple related configuration values in the way that was shown in the previous example,\n+users can also use the `@io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties` annotation to group these properties together.\n+\n+For the greeting properties above, a `GreetingConfiguration` class could be created like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+package org.acme.config;\n+\n+import io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties;\n+import java.util.Optional;\n+\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\") <1>\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    private String message;\n+    private String suffix = \"!\"; <2>\n+    private Optional<String> name;\n+\n+    public String getMessage() {\n+        return message;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setMessage(String message) {\n+        this.message = message;\n+    }\n+\n+    public String getSuffix() {\n+        return suffix;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setSuffix(String suffix) {\n+        this.suffix = suffix;\n+    }\n+\n+    public Optional<String> getName() {\n+        return name;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setName(Optional<String> name) {\n+        this.name = name;\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+<1> `prefix` is optional. If not set then the prefix to be used will be determined by the class name. In this case it would still be `greeting` (since the `Configuration` suffix is removed). If the class were named `GreetingExtraConfiguration` then the resulting default prefix would be `greeting-extra`.\n+<2> `!` will be the default value if `greeting.suffix` is not set\n+\n+This class could then be injected into the `GreetingResource` using the familiar CDI `@Inject` annotation like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@Inject\n+GreetingConfiguration greetingConfiguration;\n+----\n+\n+Another alternative style provided by Quarkus is to create `GreetingConfiguration` as an interface like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+package org.acme.config;\n+\n+import io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties;\n+import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.inject.ConfigProperty;\n+import java.util.Optional;\n+\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public interface GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @ConfigProperty(name = \"message\") <1>\n+    String message();\n+\n+    @ConfigProperty(defaultValue = \"!\")\n+    String getSuffix(); <2>\n+\n+    Optional<String> getName(); <3>\n+}\n+----\n+<1> The `@ConfigProperty` annotation is needed because the name of the configuration property that the method corresponds to doesn't follow the getter method naming conventions\n+<2> In this case since `name` was not set, the corresponding property will be `greeting.suffix`.\n+<3> It is unnecessary to specify the `@ConfigProperty` annotation because the method name follows the getter method naming conventions (`greeting.name` being the corresponding property) and no default value is needed.\n+\n+When using `@ConfigProperties` on a class or an interface, if the value of one of its fields is not provided, the application startup will fail and a `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.DeploymentException` indicating the missing value information will be thrown.\n+This does not apply to `Optional` fields and fields with a default value.\n+\n+=== Additional notes on @ConfigProperties\n+\n+When using a regular class annotated with `@ConfigProperties` the class doesn't necessarily have to declare getters and setters.\n+Having simple public non-final fields is valid as well.\n+\n+Furthermore, the configuration classes support nested object configuration. Suppose there was a need to have an extra layer\n+of greeting configuration named `content` that would contain a few fields. This could be achieved like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+    public Optional<String> name;\n+    public ContentConfig content; <1>\n+\n+    public static class ContentConfig {\n+        public Integer prizeAmount;\n+        public List<String> recipients;\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+<1> The name of the field (not the class name) will determine the name of the properties that are bound to the object.\n+\n+Setting the properties would occur in the normal manner, for example in `application.properties` one could have:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+greeting.message = hello\n+greeting.name = quarkus\n+greeting.content.prize-amount=10\n+greeting.content.recipients=Jane,John\n+----\n+\n+Furthermore, classes annotated with `@ConfigProperties` can be annotated with Bean Validation annotations similar to the following example:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @Size(min = 20)\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+\n+}\n+----\n+\n+WARNING: For validation to work, the `quarkus-hibernate-validator` extension needs to be present.\n+\n+If the validation fails with the given configuration, the application will fail to start and indicate the corresponding validation errors in the log.\n+\n+In the case of an interface being annotated with `@ConfigProperties`, the interface is allowed to extend other interfaces and methods from\n+the entire interface hierarchy are used to bind properties.\n+\n+=== Using same ConfigProperties with different prefixes\n+\n+Quarkus also supports the use of the same `@ConfigProperties` object with different prefixes for each injection point using the `io.quarkus.arc.config.@ConfigPrefix` annotation.\n+Say for example that `GreetingConfiguration` from above needs to be used for both the `greeting` prefix and the `other` prefix.\n+In that case the code would look like so:\n+\n+`GreetingConfiguration.java`\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @Size(min = 20)\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+\n+}\n+----\n+\n+`SomeBean.java`\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ApplicationScoped\n+public class SomeBean {\n+\n+    @Inject <1>\n+    GreetingConfiguration greetingConfiguration;\n+\n+    @ConfigPrefix(\"other\") <2>\n+    GreetingConfiguration otherConfiguration;\n+\n+}\n+----\n+<1> At this injection point `greetingConfiguration` will use the `greeting` prefix since that is what has been defined on `@ConfigProperties`.\n+<2> At this injection point `otherConfiguration` will use the `other` prefix from `@ConfigPrefix` instead of the `greeting` prefix. Notice that in this case `@Inject` is not required.\n+\n+[[configuration_profiles]]\n+== Configuration Profiles\n+\n+Quarkus supports the notion of configuration profiles. \n+These allow you to have multiple configurations in the same file and select between them via a profile name.\n+\n+The syntax for this is `%{profile}.config.key=value`. For example if I have the following:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+quarkus.http.port=9090\n+%dev.quarkus.http.port=8181\n+----\n+\n+The Quarkus HTTP port will be 9090, unless the `dev` profile is active, in which case it will be 8181.\n+\n+To use profiles in the `.env` file, you can follow a `_{PROFILE}_CONFIG_KEY=value` pattern. An equivalent of the above example in an `.env` file would be:\n+\n+[source,.env]\n+----\n+QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=9090\n+_DEV_QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=8181\n+----\n+\n+By default Quarkus has three profiles, although it is possible to use as many as you like. \n+The default profiles are:\n+\n+* *dev* - Activated when in development mode (i.e. `quarkus:dev`)\n+* *test* - Activated when running tests\n+* *prod* - The default profile when not running in development or test mode\n+\n+There are two ways to set a custom profile, either via the `quarkus.profile` system property or the `QUARKUS_PROFILE`\n+environment variable. If both are set the system property takes precedence. Note that it is not necessary to\n+define the names of these profiles anywhere, all that is necessary is to create a config property with the profile\n+name, and then set the current profile to that name. For example if I want a `staging` profile with a different HTTP port I can add the following to `application.properties`:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+quarkus.http.port=9090\n+%staging.quarkus.http.port=9999\n+----\n+\n+And then set the `QUARKUS_PROFILE` environment variable to `staging` to activate my profile.\n+\n+[NOTE]\n+====\n+The proper way to check the active profile programmatically is to use the `getActiveProfile` method of `io.quarkus.runtime.configuration.ProfileManager`.\n+\n+Using `@ConfigProperty(\"quarkus.profile\")` will *not* work properly.\n+====\n+\n+=== Default Runtime Profile\n+\n+The default Quarkus application runtime profile is set to the profile used to build the application.\n+For example:\n+[source,bash]\n+----\n+./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.profile=prod-aws\n+./target/my-app-1.0-runner // <1>\n+----\n+<1> The command will run with the `prod-aws` profile. This can be overridden using the `quarkus.profile` system property.\n+\n+\n+[[using_property_expressions]]\n+== Using Property Expressions\n+\n+Quarkus supports the use of property expressions in the `application.properties` file.\n+\n+These expressions are resolved when the property is read.\n+So if your configuration property is a build time configuration property, the property expression will be resolved at build time.\n+If your configuration property is overridable at runtime, the property expression will be resolved at runtime.\n+\n+You can use property expressions both for the Quarkus configuration or for your own configuration properties.\n+\n+Property expressions are defined this way: `${my-property-expression}`.\n+\n+For example, having the following property:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+remote.host=quarkus.io\n+----\n+and another property defined as:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+callable.url=https://${remote.host}/\n+----\n+\n+will result in the value of the `callable.url` property being set to:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+callable.url=https://quarkus.io/\n+----\n+\n+Another example would be defining different database servers depending on the profile used:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+%dev.quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://remotehost:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+----\n+\n+can be simplified by having:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+%dev.application.server=localhost\n+application.server=remotehost\n+\n+quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://${application.server}:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+----\n+\n+It does result in one more line in this example but the value of `application.server` can be reused in other properties,\n+diminishing the possibility of typos and providing more flexibility in property definitions.\n+\n+\n+[#combine-property-env-var]\n+== Combining Property Expressions and Environment Variables\n+\n+Quarkus also supports the combination of both property expressions and environment variables.\n+\n+Let's assume you have following property defined in `application.properties`:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+remote.host=quarkus.io\n+----\n+\n+You can combine environment variables and property expressions by having a property defined as follows:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+application.host=${HOST:${remote.host}}\n+----\n+\n+This will expand the `HOST` environment variable and use the value of the property `remote.host` as the default value if `HOST` is not set.\n+\n+For the purpose of this section we used the property `remote.host` we defined previously.\n+It has to be noted that the value could have been a fixed one such as in:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+application.host=${HOST:localhost}\n+----\n+\n+which will result in `localhost` as the default value if `HOST` is not set.\n+\n+[[configuring_quarkus]]\n+== Configuring Quarkus\n+\n+Quarkus itself is configured via the same mechanism as your application. Quarkus reserves the `quarkus.` namespace\n+for its own configuration and the configuration of all of its extensions. For example to configure the HTTP server port you can set `quarkus.http.port` in\n+`application.properties`. All the Quarkus configuration properties are link:all-config[documented and searchable].\n+\n+[IMPORTANT]\n+====\n+As mentioned above, properties prefixed with `quarkus.` are effectively reserved for configuring Quarkus itself and\n+therefore `quarkus.` should **never** be used as prefix for application specific properties.\n+\n+In the previous examples using `quarkus.message` instead of `greeting.message` would result in unexpected behavior.\n+====\n+\n+Quarkus does much of its configuration and bootstrap at build time and most configuration properties are read and used during the build.\n+These properties are _fixed at build time_ and it's not possible to change them at runtime.\n+You always need to repackage your application in order to reflect changes of such properties.\n+\n+TIP: The properties fixed at build time are marked with a lock icon (icon:lock[]) in the link:all-config[list of all configuration options].\n+\n+However, some extensions do define properties that can be _overriden at runtime_.\n+A canonical example is the database URL, username and password which is only known specifically in your target environment.\n+This is a tradeoff as the more runtime properties are available, the less build time prework Quarkus can do. \n+The list of runtime properties is therefore lean.\n+You can override these runtime properties with the following mechanisms (in decreasing priority) using:\n+\n+1. System properties\n+2. Environment variables\n+3. An environment file named `.env` placed in the current working directory\n+4. A configuration file placed in `$PWD/config/application.properties`\n+\n+See <<configuration_sources>> for more details.\n+\n+== Generating configuration for your application\n+\n+It is also possible to generate an example `application.properties` with all known configuration properties, to make\n+it easy to see what Quarkus configuration options are available. To do this, run:\n+\n+[source,bash]\n+--\n+./mvnw quarkus:generate-config\n+--\n+\n+This will create a `src/main/resources/application.properties.example` file that contains all the config options\n+exposed via the extensions you currently have installed. These options are commented out, and have their default value\n+when applicable. For example this HTTP port config entry will appear as:\n+\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+--\n+#\n+# The HTTP port\n+#\n+#quarkus.http.port=8080\n+--\n+\n+Rather than generating an example config file, you can also add these to you actual config file by setting the `-Dfile`\n+parameter:\n+\n+[source,bash]\n+--\n+./mvnw quarkus:generate-config -Dfile=application.properties\n+--\n+\n+If a config option is already present (commented or not) it will not be added, so it is safe to run this after\n+adding an additional extension to see what additional options have been added.\n+\n+== Clearing properties\n+\n+Run time properties which are optional, and which have had values set at build time or which have a default value,\n+may be explicitly cleared by assigning an empty string to the property.  Note that this will _only_ affect\n+run time properties, and will _only_ work with properties whose values are not required.\n+\n+The property may be cleared by setting the corresponding `application.properties` property, setting the\n+corresponding system property, or setting the corresponding environment variable.\n+\n+[[custom_configuration]]\n+== Custom Configuration\n+\n+=== Custom configuration sources\n+\n+You can also introduce custom configuration sources in the standard MicroProfile Config manner.  To\n+do this, you must provide a class which implements either `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.ConfigSource`\n+or `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.ConfigSourceProvider`.  Create a\n+https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html[service file] for the\n+class and it will be detected and installed at application startup.\n+\n+=== Custom configuration converters\n+\n+You can also use your custom types as a configuration values. This can be done by implementing `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter<T>`\n+and adding its fully qualified class name in the `META-INF/services/org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter` file.\n+\n+Let us assume you have a custom type like this one:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+package org.acme.config;\n+\n+public class MicroProfileCustomValue {\n+\n+    private final int number;\n+\n+    public MicroProfileCustomValue(int number) {\n+        this.number = number;\n+    }\n+\n+    public int getNumber() {\n+        return number;\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+\n+The corresponding converter will look like the one below. Please note that your custom converter class must be `public` and must have\n+a `public` no-argument constructor. It also must not be `abstract`.\n+\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+package org.acme.config;\n+\n+import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter;\n+\n+public class MicroProfileCustomValueConverter implements Converter<MicroProfileCustomValue> {\n+\n+    @Override\n+    public MicroProfileCustomValue convert(String value) {\n+        return new MicroProfileCustomValue(Integer.valueOf(value));\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+\n+Then you need to include the fully qualified class name of the converter in a service file `META-INF/services/org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter`.\n+If you have more converters, simply add their class names in this file as well. Single fully qualified class name per line, for example:\n+\n+[source]\n+----\n+org.acme.config.MicroProfileCustomValueConverter\n+org.acme.config.SomeOtherConverter\n+org.acme.config.YetAnotherConverter\n+----\n+\n+Please note that `SomeOtherConverter` and `YetAnotherConverter` were added just for a demonstration.

To make use of it, `config/application.properties` needs to be placed inside the build tool's output directory (`target` for Maven and `build/classes/java/main` for Gradle).\n+Keep in mind however that any cleaning operation from the build tool like `mvn clean` or `gradle clean` will remove the `config` directory as well.\n+\n+[[application_properties_file]]\n+=== An application configuration file\n+\n+This is the main application configuration file located in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.\n+\n+.Example `application.properties` file\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+greeting.message=hello <1>\n+quarkus.http.port=9090 <2>\n+----\n+<1> This is a user-defind configuration property.\n+<2> This is a configuration property consumed by the `quarkus-vertx-http` extension.\n+\n+TIP: Quarkus supports the use of <<using_property_expressions,property expressions>> in the `application.properties` file.\n+\n+== Injecting configuration properties\n+\n+Quarkus uses https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config] annotations to inject the configuration properties in the application.\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.message\") <1>\n+String message;\n+----\n+<1> You can use `@Inject @ConfigProperty` or just `@ConfigProperty`.\n+The `@Inject` annotation is not necessary for members annotated with `@ConfigProperty`.\n+This behavior differs from https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config].\n+\n+NOTE: If the application attempts to inject a configuration property that is not set, an error is thrown, thus allowing you to quickly know when your configuration is complete.\n+\n+.More `@ConfigProperty` Examples\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.message\") <1>\n+String message;\n+\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.suffix\", defaultValue=\"!\") <2>\n+String suffix;\n+\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.name\")\n+Optional<String> name; <3>\n+----\n+<1> If you do not provide a value for this property, the application startup fails with `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.DeploymentException: No config value of type [class java.lang.String] exists for: greeting.message`.\n+<2> The default value is injected if the configuration does not provide a value for `greeting.suffix`.\n+<3> This property is optional - an empty `Optional` is injected if the configuration does not provide a value for `greeting.name`.\n+\n+== Programmatically access the configuration\n+\n+You can also access the configuration programmatically.\n+It can be handy to achieve dynamic lookup, or retrieve configured values from classes that are neither CDI beans or JAX-RS resources.\n+\n+You can access the configuration programmatically using `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.ConfigProvider.getConfig()` such as in:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+String databaseName = ConfigProvider.getConfig().getValue(\"database.name\", String.class);\n+Optional<String> maybeDatabaseName = ConfigProvider.getConfig().getOptionalValue(\"database.name\", String.class);\n+----\n+\n+[[using_configproperties]]\n+== Using @ConfigProperties\n+\n+As an alternative to injecting multiple related configuration values in the way that was shown in the previous example,\n+users can also use the `@io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties` annotation to group these properties together.\n+\n+For the greeting properties above, a `GreetingConfiguration` class could be created like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+package org.acme.config;\n+\n+import io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties;\n+import java.util.Optional;\n+\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\") <1>\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    private String message;\n+    private String suffix = \"!\"; <2>\n+    private Optional<String> name;\n+\n+    public String getMessage() {\n+        return message;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setMessage(String message) {\n+        this.message = message;\n+    }\n+\n+    public String getSuffix() {\n+        return suffix;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setSuffix(String suffix) {\n+        this.suffix = suffix;\n+    }\n+\n+    public Optional<String> getName() {\n+        return name;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setName(Optional<String> name) {\n+        this.name = name;\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+<1> `prefix` is optional. If not set then the prefix to be used will be determined by the class name. In this case it would still be `greeting` (since the `Configuration` suffix is removed). If the class were named `GreetingExtraConfiguration` then the resulting default prefix would be `greeting-extra`.\n+<2> `!` will be the default value if `greeting.suffix` is not set\n+\n+This class could then be injected into the `GreetingResource` using the familiar CDI `@Inject` annotation like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@Inject\n+GreetingConfiguration greetingConfiguration;\n+----\n+\n+Another alternative style provided by Quarkus is to create `GreetingConfiguration` as an interface like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+package org.acme.config;\n+\n+import io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties;\n+import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.inject.ConfigProperty;\n+import java.util.Optional;\n+\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public interface GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @ConfigProperty(name = \"message\") <1>\n+    String message();\n+\n+    @ConfigProperty(defaultValue = \"!\")\n+    String getSuffix(); <2>\n+\n+    Optional<String> getName(); <3>\n+}\n+----\n+<1> The `@ConfigProperty` annotation is needed because the name of the configuration property that the method corresponds to doesn't follow the getter method naming conventions\n+<2> In this case since `name` was not set, the corresponding property will be `greeting.suffix`.\n+<3> It is unnecessary to specify the `@ConfigProperty` annotation because the method name follows the getter method naming conventions (`greeting.name` being the corresponding property) and no default value is needed.\n+\n+When using `@ConfigProperties` on a class or an interface, if the value of one of its fields is not provided, the application startup will fail and a `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.DeploymentException` indicating the missing value information will be thrown.\n+This does not apply to `Optional` fields and fields with a default value.\n+\n+=== Additional notes on @ConfigProperties\n+\n+When using a regular class annotated with `@ConfigProperties` the class doesn't necessarily have to declare getters and setters.\n+Having simple public non-final fields is valid as well.\n+\n+Furthermore, the configuration classes support nested object configuration. Suppose there was a need to have an extra layer\n+of greeting configuration named `content` that would contain a few fields. This could be achieved like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+    public Optional<String> name;\n+    public ContentConfig content; <1>\n+\n+    public static class ContentConfig {\n+        public Integer prizeAmount;\n+        public List<String> recipients;\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+<1> The name of the field (not the class name) will determine the name of the properties that are bound to the object.\n+\n+Setting the properties would occur in the normal manner, for example in `application.properties` one could have:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+greeting.message = hello\n+greeting.name = quarkus\n+greeting.content.prize-amount=10\n+greeting.content.recipients=Jane,John\n+----\n+\n+Furthermore, classes annotated with `@ConfigProperties` can be annotated with Bean Validation annotations similar to the following example:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @Size(min = 20)\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+\n+}\n+----\n+\n+WARNING: For validation to work, the `quarkus-hibernate-validator` extension needs to be present.\n+\n+If the validation fails with the given configuration, the application will fail to start and indicate the corresponding validation errors in the log.\n+\n+In the case of an interface being annotated with `@ConfigProperties`, the interface is allowed to extend other interfaces and methods from\n+the entire interface hierarchy are used to bind properties.\n+\n+=== Using same ConfigProperties with different prefixes\n+\n+Quarkus also supports the use of the same `@ConfigProperties` object with different prefixes for each injection point using the `io.quarkus.arc.config.@ConfigPrefix` annotation.\n+Say for example that `GreetingConfiguration` from above needs to be used for both the `greeting` prefix and the `other` prefix.\n+In that case the code would look like so:\n+\n+`GreetingConfiguration.java`\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @Size(min = 20)\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+\n+}\n+----\n+\n+`SomeBean.java`\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ApplicationScoped\n+public class SomeBean {\n+\n+    @Inject <1>\n+    GreetingConfiguration greetingConfiguration;\n+\n+    @ConfigPrefix(\"other\") <2>\n+    GreetingConfiguration otherConfiguration;\n+\n+}\n+----\n+<1> At this injection point `greetingConfiguration` will use the `greeting` prefix since that is what has been defined on `@ConfigProperties`.\n+<2> At this injection point `otherConfiguration` will use the `other` prefix from `@ConfigPrefix` instead of the `greeting` prefix. Notice that in this case `@Inject` is not required.\n+\n+[[configuration_profiles]]\n+== Configuration Profiles\n+\n+Quarkus supports the notion of configuration profiles. \n+These allow you to have multiple configurations in the same file and select between them via a profile name.\n+\n+The syntax for this is `%{profile}.config.key=value`. For example if I have the following:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+quarkus.http.port=9090\n+%dev.quarkus.http.port=8181\n+----\n+\n+The Quarkus HTTP port will be 9090, unless the `dev` profile is active, in which case it will be 8181.\n+\n+To use profiles in the `.env` file, you can follow a `_{PROFILE}_CONFIG_KEY=value` pattern. An equivalent of the above example in an `.env` file would be:\n+\n+[source,.env]\n+----\n+QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=9090\n+_DEV_QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=8181\n+----\n+\n+By default Quarkus has three profiles, although it is possible to use as many as you like. \n+The default profiles are:\n+\n+* *dev* - Activated when in development mode (i.e. `quarkus:dev`)\n+* *test* - Activated when running tests\n+* *prod* - The default profile when not running in development or test mode\n+\n+There are two ways to set a custom profile, either via the `quarkus.profile` system property or the `QUARKUS_PROFILE`\n+environment variable. If both are set the system property takes precedence. Note that it is not necessary to\n+define the names of these profiles anywhere, all that is necessary is to create a config property with the profile\n+name, and then set the current profile to that name. For example if I want a `staging` profile with a different HTTP port I can add the following to `application.properties`:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+quarkus.http.port=9090\n+%staging.quarkus.http.port=9999\n+----\n+\n+And then set the `QUARKUS_PROFILE` environment variable to `staging` to activate my profile.\n+\n+[NOTE]\n+====\n+The proper way to check the active profile programmatically is to use the `getActiveProfile` method of `io.quarkus.runtime.configuration.ProfileManager`.\n+\n+Using `@ConfigProperty(\"quarkus.profile\")` will *not* work properly.\n+====\n+\n+=== Default Runtime Profile\n+\n+The default Quarkus application runtime profile is set to the profile used to build the application.\n+For example:\n+[source,bash]\n+----\n+./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.profile=prod-aws\n+./target/my-app-1.0-runner // <1>\n+----\n+<1> The command will run with the `prod-aws` profile. This can be overridden using the `quarkus.profile` system property.\n+\n+\n+[[using_property_expressions]]\n+== Using Property Expressions\n+\n+Quarkus supports the use of property expressions in the `application.properties` file.\n+\n+These expressions are resolved when the property is read.\n+So if your configuration property is a build time configuration property, the property expression will be resolved at build time.\n+If your configuration property is overridable at runtime, the property expression will be resolved at runtime.\n+\n+You can use property expressions both for the Quarkus configuration or for your own configuration properties.\n+\n+Property expressions are defined this way: `${my-property-expression}`.\n+\n+For example, having the following property:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+remote.host=quarkus.io\n+----\n+and another property defined as:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+callable.url=https://${remote.host}/\n+----\n+\n+will result in the value of the `callable.url` property being set to:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+callable.url=https://quarkus.io/\n+----\n+\n+Another example would be defining different database servers depending on the profile used:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+%dev.quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://remotehost:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+----\n+\n+can be simplified by having:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+%dev.application.server=localhost\n+application.server=remotehost\n+\n+quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://${application.server}:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+----\n+\n+It does result in one more line in this example but the value of `application.server` can be reused in other properties,\n+diminishing the possibility of typos and providing more flexibility in property definitions.\n+\n+\n+[#combine-property-env-var]\n+== Combining Property Expressions and Environment Variables\n+\n+Quarkus also supports the combination of both property expressions and environment variables.\n+\n+Let's assume you have following property defined in `application.properties`:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+remote.host=quarkus.io\n+----\n+\n+You can combine environment variables and property expressions by having a property defined as follows:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+application.host=${HOST:${remote.host}}\n+----\n+\n+This will expand the `HOST` environment variable and use the value of the property `remote.host` as the default value if `HOST` is not set.\n+\n+For the purpose of this section we used the property `remote.host` we defined previously.\n+It has to be noted that the value could have been a fixed one such as in:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+application.host=${HOST:localhost}\n+----\n+\n+which will result in `localhost` as the default value if `HOST` is not set.\n+\n+[[configuring_quarkus]]\n+== Configuring Quarkus\n+\n+Quarkus itself is configured via the same mechanism as your application. Quarkus reserves the `quarkus.` namespace\n+for its own configuration and the configuration of all of its extensions. For example to configure the HTTP server port you can set `quarkus.http.port` in\n+`application.properties`. All the Quarkus configuration properties are link:all-config[documented and searchable].\n+\n+[IMPORTANT]\n+====\n+As mentioned above, properties prefixed with `quarkus.` are effectively reserved for configuring Quarkus itself and\n+therefore `quarkus.` should **never** be used as prefix for application specific properties.\n+\n+In the previous examples using `quarkus.message` instead of `greeting.message` would result in unexpected behavior.\n+====\n+\n+Quarkus does much of its configuration and bootstrap at build time and most configuration properties are read and used during the build.\n+These properties are _fixed at build time_ and it's not possible to change them at runtime.\n+You always need to repackage your application in order to reflect changes of such properties.\n+\n+TIP: The properties fixed at build time are marked with a lock icon (icon:lock[]) in the link:all-config[list of all configuration options].\n+\n+However, some extensions do define properties that can be _overriden at runtime_.\n+A canonical example is the database URL, username and password which is only known specifically in your target environment.\n+This is a tradeoff as the more runtime properties are available, the less build time prework Quarkus can do. \n+The list of runtime properties is therefore lean.\n+You can override these runtime properties with the following mechanisms (in decreasing priority) using:\n+\n+1. System properties\n+2. Environment variables\n+3. An environment file named `.env` placed in the current working directory\n+4. A configuration file placed in `$PWD/config/application.properties`\n+\n+See <<configuration_sources>> for more details.\n+\n+== Generating configuration for your application\n+\n+It is also possible to generate an example `application.properties` with all known configuration properties, to make\n+it easy to see what Quarkus configuration options are available. To do this, run:\n+\n+[source,bash]\n+--\n+./mvnw quarkus:generate-config\n+--\n+\n+This will create a `src/main/resources/application.properties.example` file that contains all the config options\n+exposed via the extensions you currently have installed. These options are commented out, and have their default value\n+when applicable. For example this HTTP port config entry will appear as:\n+\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+--\n+#\n+# The HTTP port\n+#\n+#quarkus.http.port=8080\n+--\n+\n+Rather than generating an example config file, you can also add these to you actual config file by setting the `-Dfile`\n+parameter:\n+\n+[source,bash]\n+--\n+./mvnw quarkus:generate-config -Dfile=application.properties\n+--\n+\n+If a config option is already present (commented or not) it will not be added, so it is safe to run this after\n+adding an additional extension to see what additional options have been added.\n+\n+== Clearing properties\n+\n+Run time properties which are optional, and which have had values set at build time or which have a default value,\n+may be explicitly cleared by assigning an empty string to the property.  Note that this will _only_ affect\n+run time properties, and will _only_ work with properties whose values are not required.\n+\n+The property may be cleared by setting the corresponding `application.properties` property, setting the\n+corresponding system property, or setting the corresponding environment variable.\n+\n+[[custom_configuration]]\n+== Custom Configuration\n+\n+=== Custom configuration sources\n+\n+You can also introduce custom configuration sources in the standard MicroProfile Config manner.  To\n+do this, you must provide a class which implements either `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.ConfigSource`\n+or `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.ConfigSourceProvider`.  Create a\n+https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html[service file] for the\n+class and it will be detected and installed at application startup.\n+\n+=== Custom configuration converters\n+\n+You can also use your custom types as a configuration values. This can be done by implementing `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter<T>`\n+and adding its fully qualified class name in the `META-INF/services/org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter` file.\n+\n+Let us assume you have a custom type like this one:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+package org.acme.config;\n+\n+public class MicroProfileCustomValue {\n+\n+    private final int number;\n+\n+    public MicroProfileCustomValue(int number) {\n+        this.number = number;\n+    }\n+\n+    public int getNumber() {\n+        return number;\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+\n+The corresponding converter will look like the one below. Please note that your custom converter class must be `public` and must have\n+a `public` no-argument constructor. It also must not be `abstract`.\n+\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+package org.acme.config;\n+\n+import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter;\n+\n+public class MicroProfileCustomValueConverter implements Converter<MicroProfileCustomValue> {\n+\n+    @Override\n+    public MicroProfileCustomValue convert(String value) {\n+        return new MicroProfileCustomValue(Integer.valueOf(value));\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+\n+Then you need to include the fully qualified class name of the converter in a service file `META-INF/services/org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter`.\n+If you have more converters, simply add their class names in this file as well. Single fully qualified class name per line, for example:\n+\n+[source]\n+----\n+org.acme.config.MicroProfileCustomValueConverter\n+org.acme.config.SomeOtherConverter\n+org.acme.config.YetAnotherConverter\n+----\n+\n+Please note that `SomeOtherConverter` and `YetAnotherConverter` were added just for a demonstration. If you include in this file classes\n+which are not available at runtime, the converters loading will fail.\n+\n+After this is done you can use your custom type as a configuration value:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"configuration.value.name\")\n+MicroProfileCustomValue value;\n+----\n+\n+==== Converter priority\n+\n+In some cases, you may want to use a custom converter to convert a type which is already converted\n+by a different converter.

To make use of it, `config/application.properties` needs to be placed inside the build tool's output directory (`target` for Maven and `build/classes/java/main` for Gradle).\n+Keep in mind however that any cleaning operation from the build tool like `mvn clean` or `gradle clean` will remove the `config` directory as well.\n+\n+[[application_properties_file]]\n+=== An application configuration file\n+\n+This is the main application configuration file located in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.\n+\n+.Example `application.properties` file\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+greeting.message=hello <1>\n+quarkus.http.port=9090 <2>\n+----\n+<1> This is a user-defind configuration property.\n+<2> This is a configuration property consumed by the `quarkus-vertx-http` extension.\n+\n+TIP: Quarkus supports the use of <<using_property_expressions,property expressions>> in the `application.properties` file.\n+\n+== Injecting configuration properties\n+\n+Quarkus uses https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config] annotations to inject the configuration properties in the application.\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.message\") <1>\n+String message;\n+----\n+<1> You can use `@Inject @ConfigProperty` or just `@ConfigProperty`.\n+The `@Inject` annotation is not necessary for members annotated with `@ConfigProperty`.\n+This behavior differs from https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config].\n+\n+NOTE: If the application attempts to inject a configuration property that is not set, an error is thrown, thus allowing you to quickly know when your configuration is complete.\n+\n+.More `@ConfigProperty` Examples\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.message\") <1>\n+String message;\n+\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.suffix\", defaultValue=\"!\") <2>\n+String suffix;\n+\n+@ConfigProperty(name = \"greeting.name\")\n+Optional<String> name; <3>\n+----\n+<1> If you do not provide a value for this property, the application startup fails with `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.DeploymentException: No config value of type [class java.lang.String] exists for: greeting.message`.\n+<2> The default value is injected if the configuration does not provide a value for `greeting.suffix`.\n+<3> This property is optional - an empty `Optional` is injected if the configuration does not provide a value for `greeting.name`.\n+\n+== Programmatically access the configuration\n+\n+You can also access the configuration programmatically.\n+It can be handy to achieve dynamic lookup, or retrieve configured values from classes that are neither CDI beans or JAX-RS resources.\n+\n+You can access the configuration programmatically using `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.ConfigProvider.getConfig()` such as in:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+String databaseName = ConfigProvider.getConfig().getValue(\"database.name\", String.class);\n+Optional<String> maybeDatabaseName = ConfigProvider.getConfig().getOptionalValue(\"database.name\", String.class);\n+----\n+\n+[[using_configproperties]]\n+== Using @ConfigProperties\n+\n+As an alternative to injecting multiple related configuration values in the way that was shown in the previous example,\n+users can also use the `@io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties` annotation to group these properties together.\n+\n+For the greeting properties above, a `GreetingConfiguration` class could be created like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+package org.acme.config;\n+\n+import io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties;\n+import java.util.Optional;\n+\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\") <1>\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    private String message;\n+    private String suffix = \"!\"; <2>\n+    private Optional<String> name;\n+\n+    public String getMessage() {\n+        return message;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setMessage(String message) {\n+        this.message = message;\n+    }\n+\n+    public String getSuffix() {\n+        return suffix;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setSuffix(String suffix) {\n+        this.suffix = suffix;\n+    }\n+\n+    public Optional<String> getName() {\n+        return name;\n+    }\n+\n+    public void setName(Optional<String> name) {\n+        this.name = name;\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+<1> `prefix` is optional. If not set then the prefix to be used will be determined by the class name. In this case it would still be `greeting` (since the `Configuration` suffix is removed). If the class were named `GreetingExtraConfiguration` then the resulting default prefix would be `greeting-extra`.\n+<2> `!` will be the default value if `greeting.suffix` is not set\n+\n+This class could then be injected into the `GreetingResource` using the familiar CDI `@Inject` annotation like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@Inject\n+GreetingConfiguration greetingConfiguration;\n+----\n+\n+Another alternative style provided by Quarkus is to create `GreetingConfiguration` as an interface like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+package org.acme.config;\n+\n+import io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties;\n+import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.inject.ConfigProperty;\n+import java.util.Optional;\n+\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public interface GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @ConfigProperty(name = \"message\") <1>\n+    String message();\n+\n+    @ConfigProperty(defaultValue = \"!\")\n+    String getSuffix(); <2>\n+\n+    Optional<String> getName(); <3>\n+}\n+----\n+<1> The `@ConfigProperty` annotation is needed because the name of the configuration property that the method corresponds to doesn't follow the getter method naming conventions\n+<2> In this case since `name` was not set, the corresponding property will be `greeting.suffix`.\n+<3> It is unnecessary to specify the `@ConfigProperty` annotation because the method name follows the getter method naming conventions (`greeting.name` being the corresponding property) and no default value is needed.\n+\n+When using `@ConfigProperties` on a class or an interface, if the value of one of its fields is not provided, the application startup will fail and a `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.DeploymentException` indicating the missing value information will be thrown.\n+This does not apply to `Optional` fields and fields with a default value.\n+\n+=== Additional notes on @ConfigProperties\n+\n+When using a regular class annotated with `@ConfigProperties` the class doesn't necessarily have to declare getters and setters.\n+Having simple public non-final fields is valid as well.\n+\n+Furthermore, the configuration classes support nested object configuration. Suppose there was a need to have an extra layer\n+of greeting configuration named `content` that would contain a few fields. This could be achieved like so:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+    public Optional<String> name;\n+    public ContentConfig content; <1>\n+\n+    public static class ContentConfig {\n+        public Integer prizeAmount;\n+        public List<String> recipients;\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+<1> The name of the field (not the class name) will determine the name of the properties that are bound to the object.\n+\n+Setting the properties would occur in the normal manner, for example in `application.properties` one could have:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+greeting.message = hello\n+greeting.name = quarkus\n+greeting.content.prize-amount=10\n+greeting.content.recipients=Jane,John\n+----\n+\n+Furthermore, classes annotated with `@ConfigProperties` can be annotated with Bean Validation annotations similar to the following example:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @Size(min = 20)\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+\n+}\n+----\n+\n+WARNING: For validation to work, the `quarkus-hibernate-validator` extension needs to be present.\n+\n+If the validation fails with the given configuration, the application will fail to start and indicate the corresponding validation errors in the log.\n+\n+In the case of an interface being annotated with `@ConfigProperties`, the interface is allowed to extend other interfaces and methods from\n+the entire interface hierarchy are used to bind properties.\n+\n+=== Using same ConfigProperties with different prefixes\n+\n+Quarkus also supports the use of the same `@ConfigProperties` object with different prefixes for each injection point using the `io.quarkus.arc.config.@ConfigPrefix` annotation.\n+Say for example that `GreetingConfiguration` from above needs to be used for both the `greeting` prefix and the `other` prefix.\n+In that case the code would look like so:\n+\n+`GreetingConfiguration.java`\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n+public class GreetingConfiguration {\n+\n+    @Size(min = 20)\n+    public String message;\n+    public String suffix = \"!\";\n+\n+}\n+----\n+\n+`SomeBean.java`\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+@ApplicationScoped\n+public class SomeBean {\n+\n+    @Inject <1>\n+    GreetingConfiguration greetingConfiguration;\n+\n+    @ConfigPrefix(\"other\") <2>\n+    GreetingConfiguration otherConfiguration;\n+\n+}\n+----\n+<1> At this injection point `greetingConfiguration` will use the `greeting` prefix since that is what has been defined on `@ConfigProperties`.\n+<2> At this injection point `otherConfiguration` will use the `other` prefix from `@ConfigPrefix` instead of the `greeting` prefix. Notice that in this case `@Inject` is not required.\n+\n+[[configuration_profiles]]\n+== Configuration Profiles\n+\n+Quarkus supports the notion of configuration profiles. \n+These allow you to have multiple configurations in the same file and select between them via a profile name.\n+\n+The syntax for this is `%{profile}.config.key=value`. For example if I have the following:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+quarkus.http.port=9090\n+%dev.quarkus.http.port=8181\n+----\n+\n+The Quarkus HTTP port will be 9090, unless the `dev` profile is active, in which case it will be 8181.\n+\n+To use profiles in the `.env` file, you can follow a `_{PROFILE}_CONFIG_KEY=value` pattern. An equivalent of the above example in an `.env` file would be:\n+\n+[source,.env]\n+----\n+QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=9090\n+_DEV_QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=8181\n+----\n+\n+By default Quarkus has three profiles, although it is possible to use as many as you like. \n+The default profiles are:\n+\n+* *dev* - Activated when in development mode (i.e. `quarkus:dev`)\n+* *test* - Activated when running tests\n+* *prod* - The default profile when not running in development or test mode\n+\n+There are two ways to set a custom profile, either via the `quarkus.profile` system property or the `QUARKUS_PROFILE`\n+environment variable. If both are set the system property takes precedence. Note that it is not necessary to\n+define the names of these profiles anywhere, all that is necessary is to create a config property with the profile\n+name, and then set the current profile to that name. For example if I want a `staging` profile with a different HTTP port I can add the following to `application.properties`:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+quarkus.http.port=9090\n+%staging.quarkus.http.port=9999\n+----\n+\n+And then set the `QUARKUS_PROFILE` environment variable to `staging` to activate my profile.\n+\n+[NOTE]\n+====\n+The proper way to check the active profile programmatically is to use the `getActiveProfile` method of `io.quarkus.runtime.configuration.ProfileManager`.\n+\n+Using `@ConfigProperty(\"quarkus.profile\")` will *not* work properly.\n+====\n+\n+=== Default Runtime Profile\n+\n+The default Quarkus application runtime profile is set to the profile used to build the application.\n+For example:\n+[source,bash]\n+----\n+./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.profile=prod-aws\n+./target/my-app-1.0-runner // <1>\n+----\n+<1> The command will run with the `prod-aws` profile. This can be overridden using the `quarkus.profile` system property.\n+\n+\n+[[using_property_expressions]]\n+== Using Property Expressions\n+\n+Quarkus supports the use of property expressions in the `application.properties` file.\n+\n+These expressions are resolved when the property is read.\n+So if your configuration property is a build time configuration property, the property expression will be resolved at build time.\n+If your configuration property is overridable at runtime, the property expression will be resolved at runtime.\n+\n+You can use property expressions both for the Quarkus configuration or for your own configuration properties.\n+\n+Property expressions are defined this way: `${my-property-expression}`.\n+\n+For example, having the following property:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+remote.host=quarkus.io\n+----\n+and another property defined as:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+callable.url=https://${remote.host}/\n+----\n+\n+will result in the value of the `callable.url` property being set to:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+callable.url=https://quarkus.io/\n+----\n+\n+Another example would be defining different database servers depending on the profile used:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+%dev.quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://remotehost:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+----\n+\n+can be simplified by having:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+%dev.application.server=localhost\n+application.server=remotehost\n+\n+quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://${application.server}:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n+----\n+\n+It does result in one more line in this example but the value of `application.server` can be reused in other properties,\n+diminishing the possibility of typos and providing more flexibility in property definitions.\n+\n+\n+[#combine-property-env-var]\n+== Combining Property Expressions and Environment Variables\n+\n+Quarkus also supports the combination of both property expressions and environment variables.\n+\n+Let's assume you have following property defined in `application.properties`:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+remote.host=quarkus.io\n+----\n+\n+You can combine environment variables and property expressions by having a property defined as follows:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+application.host=${HOST:${remote.host}}\n+----\n+\n+This will expand the `HOST` environment variable and use the value of the property `remote.host` as the default value if `HOST` is not set.\n+\n+For the purpose of this section we used the property `remote.host` we defined previously.\n+It has to be noted that the value could have been a fixed one such as in:\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+----\n+application.host=${HOST:localhost}\n+----\n+\n+which will result in `localhost` as the default value if `HOST` is not set.\n+\n+[[configuring_quarkus]]\n+== Configuring Quarkus\n+\n+Quarkus itself is configured via the same mechanism as your application. Quarkus reserves the `quarkus.` namespace\n+for its own configuration and the configuration of all of its extensions. For example to configure the HTTP server port you can set `quarkus.http.port` in\n+`application.properties`. All the Quarkus configuration properties are link:all-config[documented and searchable].\n+\n+[IMPORTANT]\n+====\n+As mentioned above, properties prefixed with `quarkus.` are effectively reserved for configuring Quarkus itself and\n+therefore `quarkus.` should **never** be used as prefix for application specific properties.\n+\n+In the previous examples using `quarkus.message` instead of `greeting.message` would result in unexpected behavior.\n+====\n+\n+Quarkus does much of its configuration and bootstrap at build time and most configuration properties are read and used during the build.\n+These properties are _fixed at build time_ and it's not possible to change them at runtime.\n+You always need to repackage your application in order to reflect changes of such properties.\n+\n+TIP: The properties fixed at build time are marked with a lock icon (icon:lock[]) in the link:all-config[list of all configuration options].\n+\n+However, some extensions do define properties that can be _overriden at runtime_.\n+A canonical example is the database URL, username and password which is only known specifically in your target environment.\n+This is a tradeoff as the more runtime properties are available, the less build time prework Quarkus can do. \n+The list of runtime properties is therefore lean.\n+You can override these runtime properties with the following mechanisms (in decreasing priority) using:\n+\n+1. System properties\n+2. Environment variables\n+3. An environment file named `.env` placed in the current working directory\n+4. A configuration file placed in `$PWD/config/application.properties`\n+\n+See <<configuration_sources>> for more details.\n+\n+== Generating configuration for your application\n+\n+It is also possible to generate an example `application.properties` with all known configuration properties, to make\n+it easy to see what Quarkus configuration options are available. To do this, run:\n+\n+[source,bash]\n+--\n+./mvnw quarkus:generate-config\n+--\n+\n+This will create a `src/main/resources/application.properties.example` file that contains all the config options\n+exposed via the extensions you currently have installed. These options are commented out, and have their default value\n+when applicable. For example this HTTP port config entry will appear as:\n+\n+\n+[source,properties]\n+--\n+#\n+# The HTTP port\n+#\n+#quarkus.http.port=8080\n+--\n+\n+Rather than generating an example config file, you can also add these to you actual config file by setting the `-Dfile`\n+parameter:\n+\n+[source,bash]\n+--\n+./mvnw quarkus:generate-config -Dfile=application.properties\n+--\n+\n+If a config option is already present (commented or not) it will not be added, so it is safe to run this after\n+adding an additional extension to see what additional options have been added.\n+\n+== Clearing properties\n+\n+Run time properties which are optional, and which have had values set at build time or which have a default value,\n+may be explicitly cleared by assigning an empty string to the property.  Note that this will _only_ affect\n+run time properties, and will _only_ work with properties whose values are not required.\n+\n+The property may be cleared by setting the corresponding `application.properties` property, setting the\n+corresponding system property, or setting the corresponding environment variable.\n+\n+[[custom_configuration]]\n+== Custom Configuration\n+\n+=== Custom configuration sources\n+\n+You can also introduce custom configuration sources in the standard MicroProfile Config manner.  To\n+do this, you must provide a class which implements either `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.ConfigSource`\n+or `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.ConfigSourceProvider`.  Create a\n+https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html[service file] for the\n+class and it will be detected and installed at application startup.\n+\n+=== Custom configuration converters\n+\n+You can also use your custom types as a configuration values. This can be done by implementing `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter<T>`\n+and adding its fully qualified class name in the `META-INF/services/org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter` file.\n+\n+Let us assume you have a custom type like this one:\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+package org.acme.config;\n+\n+public class MicroProfileCustomValue {\n+\n+    private final int number;\n+\n+    public MicroProfileCustomValue(int number) {\n+        this.number = number;\n+    }\n+\n+    public int getNumber() {\n+        return number;\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+\n+The corresponding converter will look like the one below. Please note that your custom converter class must be `public` and must have\n+a `public` no-argument constructor. It also must not be `abstract`.\n+\n+\n+[source,java]\n+----\n+package org.acme.config;\n+\n+import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter;\n+\n+public class MicroProfileCustomValueConverter implements Converter<MicroProfileCustomValue> {\n+\n+    @Override\n+    public MicroProfileCustomValue convert(String value) {\n+        return new MicroProfileCustomValue(Integer.valueOf(value));\n+    }\n+}\n+----\n+\n+Then you need to include the fully qualified class name of the converter in a service file `META-INF/services/org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter`.\n+If you have more converters, simply add their class names in this file as well.

To do this, run:\n+TIP: The properties fixed at build time are marked with a lock icon (icon:lock[]) in the link:all-config[list of all configuration options].\n \n-[source,bash]\n---\n-./mvnw quarkus:generate-config\n---\n-\n-This will create a `src/main/resources/application.properties.example` file that contains all the config options\n-exposed via the extensions you currently have installed. These options are commented out, and have their default value\n-when applicable. For example this HTTP port config entry will appear as:\n-\n-\n-[source,properties]\n---\n-#\n-# The HTTP port\n-#\n-#quarkus.http.port=8080\n---\n-\n-Rather than generating an example config file, you can also add these to you actual config file by setting the `-Dfile`\n-parameter:\n-\n-[source,bash]\n---\n-./mvnw quarkus:generate-config -Dfile=application.properties\n---\n-\n-If a config option is already present (commented or not) it will not be added, so it is safe to run this after\n-adding an additional extension to see what additional options have been added.\n-\n-== Overriding properties at runtime\n-\n-Quarkus does much of its configuration and bootstrap at build time.\n-Most properties will then be read and set during the build time step.\n-To change them, make sure to repackage your application.\n-\n-[source,bash]\n---\n-./mvnw clean package\n---\n-\n-Extensions do define _some_ properties as overridable at runtime.\n+However, some extensions do define properties _overridable at runtime_.\n A canonical example is the database URL, username and password which is only known specifically in your target environment.\n-This is a tradeoff as the more runtime properties are available, the less build time prework Quarkus can do. The list of runtime properties is therefore lean.\n-\n-You can override these runtime properties with the following mechanisms (in decreasing priority):\n-\n-1. using system properties:\n-  * for a runner jar: `java -Dquarkus.datasource.password=youshallnotpass -jar target/myapp-runner.jar`\n-  * for a native executable: `./target/myapp-runner -Dquarkus.datasource.password=youshallnotpass`\n-2. using environment variables:\n-  * for a runner jar: `export QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=youshallnotpass ; java -jar target/myapp-runner.jar`\n-  * for a native executable: `export QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=youshallnotpass ; ./target/myapp-runner`\n-3. using an environment file named `.env` placed in the current working directory containing the line `QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=youshallnotpass` (for dev mode, this file can be placed in the root of the project, but it is advised to not check it in to version control)\n-4. using a configuration file placed in `$PWD/config/application.properties`\n-  * By placing an `application.properties` file inside a directory named `config` which resides in the directory where the application runs, any runtime properties defined\n-in that file will override the default configuration. Furthermore any runtime properties added to this file that were not part of the original `application.properties` file\n-_will also_ be taken into account.\n-  * This works in the same way for runner jar and the native executable\n-\n-NOTE: Environment variables names are following the conversion rules of link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/blob/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/configsources.asciidoc#default-configsources[Eclipse MicroProfile]\n-\n-NOTE: Environment variables without a configuration profile defined in `.env` file will overwrite all its related profiles in `application.properties`, e.g. `%test.application.value` is overwritten by `APPLICATION_VALUE` in `.env` file.\n-\n-NOTE: The `config/application.properties` features is available in development mode as well. To make use of it, `config/application.properties` needs to be placed inside the build tool's output directory (`target` for Maven and `build/classes/java/main` for Gradle).\n-Keep in mind however that any cleaning operation from the build tool like `mvn clean` or `gradle clean` will remove the `config` directory as well.\n-\n-=== Configuration Profiles\n-\n-Quarkus supports the notion of configuration profiles. These allow you to have multiple configuration in the same file and\n-select between them via a profile name.\n-\n-The syntax for this is `%{profile}.config.key=value`. For example if I have the following:\n-\n-[source,properties]\n-----\n-quarkus.http.port=9090\n-%dev.quarkus.http.port=8181\n-----\n-\n-The Quarkus HTTP port will be 9090, unless the `dev` profile is active, in which case it will be 8181.\n-\n-To use profiles in the `.env` file, you can follow a `_{PROFILE}_CONFIG_KEY=value` pattern. An equivalent of the above example in an `.env` file would be:\n-\n-[source,.env]\n-----\n-QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=9090\n-_DEV_QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=8181\n-----\n-\n-By default Quarkus has three profiles, although it is possible to use as many as you like. The default profiles are:\n-\n-* *dev* - Activated when in development mode (i.e. `quarkus:dev`)\n-* *test* - Activated when running tests\n-* *prod* - The default profile when not running in development or test mode\n-\n-There are two ways to set a custom profile, either via the `quarkus.profile` system property or the `QUARKUS_PROFILE`\n-environment variable. If both are set the system property takes precedence. Note that it is not necessary to\n-define the names of these profiles anywhere, all that is necessary is to create a config property with the profile\n-name, and then set the current profile to that name. For example if I want a `staging` profile with a different HTTP port\n-I can add the following to `application.properties`:\n-\n-[source,properties]\n-----\n-quarkus.http.port=9090\n-%staging.quarkus.http.port=9999\n-----\n-\n-And then set the `QUARKUS_PROFILE` environment variable to `staging` to activate my profile.\n-\n-[NOTE]\n-====\n-The proper way to check the active profile programmatically is to use the `getActiveProfile` method of `io.quarkus.runtime.configuration.ProfileManager`.\n-\n-Using `@ConfigProperty(\"quarkus.profile\")` will *not* work properly.\n-====\n-\n-=== Using Property Expressions\n-\n-Quarkus supports the use of property expressions in the `application.properties` file.\n-\n-These expressions are resolved when the property is read.\n-So if your configuration property is a build time configuration property, the property expression will be resolved at build time.\n-If your configuration property is overridable at runtime, the property expression will be resolved at runtime.\n-\n-You can use property expressions both for the Quarkus configuration or for your own configuration properties.\n-\n-Property expressions are defined this way: `${my-property-expression}`.\n-\n-For example, having the following property:\n-\n-[source,properties]\n-----\n-remote.host=quarkus.io\n-----\n-and another property defined as:\n-\n-[source,properties]\n-----\n-callable.url=https://${remote.host}/\n-----\n-\n-will result in the value of the `callable.url` property being set to:\n-\n-[source,properties]\n-----\n-callable.url=https://quarkus.io/\n-----\n-\n-Another example would be defining different database servers depending on the profile used:\n-\n-[source,properties]\n-----\n-%dev.quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n-quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://remotehost:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n-----\n-\n-can be simplified by having:\n-\n-[source,properties]\n-----\n-%dev.application.server=localhost\n-application.server=remotehost\n-\n-quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://${application.server}:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n-----\n-\n-It does result in one more line in this example but the value of `application.server` can be reused in other properties,\n-diminishing the possibility of typos and providing more flexibility in property definitions.\n-\n-[#combine-property-env-var]\n-=== Combining Property Expressions and Environment Variables\n-\n-Quarkus also supports the combination of both property expressions and environment variables.\n-\n-Let's assume you have following property defined in `application.properties`:\n-\n-[source,properties]\n-----\n-remote.host=quarkus.io\n-----\n-\n-You can combine environment variables and property expressions by having a property defined as follows:\n-\n-[source,properties]\n-----\n-application.host=${HOST:${remote.host}}\n-----\n-\n-This will expand the `HOST` environment variable and use the value of the property `remote.host` as the default value if `HOST` is not set.\n-\n-For the purpose of this section we used the property `remote.host` we defined previously.\n-It has to be noted that the value could have been a fixed one such as in:\n-\n-[source,properties]\n-----\n-application.host=${HOST:localhost}\n-----\n-\n-which will result in `localhost` as the default value if `HOST` is not set.\n-\n-=== Clearing properties\n-\n-Run time properties which are optional, and which have had values set at build time or which have a default value,\n-may be explicitly cleared by assigning an empty string to the property.  Note that this will _only_ affect\n-run time properties, and will _only_ work with properties whose values are not required.\n-\n-The property may be cleared by setting the corresponding `application.properties` property, setting the\n-corresponding system property, or setting the corresponding environment variable.\n-\n-==== Miscellaneous\n-The default Quarkus application runtime profile is set to the profile used to build the application.\n-For example:\n-[source,bash]\n-----\n-./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.profile=prod-aws\n-./target/my-app-1.0-runner // <1>\n-----\n-<1> The command will run with the `prod-aws` profile. This can be overridden using the `quarkus.profile` system property.\n-\n-== Custom Configuration\n-\n-=== Custom configuration sources\n-\n-You can also introduce custom configuration sources in the standard MicroProfile Config manner.  To\n-do this, you must provide a class which implements either `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.ConfigSource`\n-or `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.ConfigSourceProvider`.  Create a\n-https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html[service file] for the\n-class and it will be detected and installed at application startup.\n-\n-=== Custom configuration converters\n-\n-You can also use your custom types as a configuration values. This can be done by implementing `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter<T>`\n-and adding its fully qualified class name in the `META-INF/services/org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter` file.\n-\n-Let us assume you have a custom type like this one:\n-\n-[source,java]\n-----\n-package org.acme.config;\n-\n-public class MicroProfileCustomValue {\n-\n-    private final int number;\n-\n-    public MicroProfileCustomValue(int number) {\n-        this.number = number;\n-    }\n-\n-    public int getNumber() {\n-        return number;\n-    }\n-}\n-----\n-\n-The corresponding converter will look like the one below. Please note that your custom converter class must be `public` and must have\n-a `public` no-argument constructor. It also must not be `abstract`.\n-\n-\n-[source,java]\n-----\n-package org.acme.config;\n-\n-import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter;\n-\n-public class MicroProfileCustomValueConverter implements Converter<MicroProfileCustomValue> {\n-\n-    @Override\n-    public MicroProfileCustomValue convert(String value) {\n-        return new MicroProfileCustomValue(Integer.valueOf(value));\n-    }\n-}\n-----\n-\n-Then you need to include the fully qualified class name of the converter in a service file `META-INF/services/org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter`.\n-If you have more converters, simply add their class names in this file as well.

The list of runtime properties is therefore lean.\n-\n-You can override these runtime properties with the following mechanisms (in decreasing priority):\n-\n-1. using system properties:\n-  * for a runner jar: `java -Dquarkus.datasource.password=youshallnotpass -jar target/myapp-runner.jar`\n-  * for a native executable: `./target/myapp-runner -Dquarkus.datasource.password=youshallnotpass`\n-2. using environment variables:\n-  * for a runner jar: `export QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=youshallnotpass ; java -jar target/myapp-runner.jar`\n-  * for a native executable: `export QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=youshallnotpass ; ./target/myapp-runner`\n-3. using an environment file named `.env` placed in the current working directory containing the line `QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=youshallnotpass` (for dev mode, this file can be placed in the root of the project, but it is advised to not check it in to version control)\n-4. using a configuration file placed in `$PWD/config/application.properties`\n-  * By placing an `application.properties` file inside a directory named `config` which resides in the directory where the application runs, any runtime properties defined\n-in that file will override the default configuration. Furthermore any runtime properties added to this file that were not part of the original `application.properties` file\n-_will also_ be taken into account.\n-  * This works in the same way for runner jar and the native executable\n-\n-NOTE: Environment variables names are following the conversion rules of link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/blob/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/configsources.asciidoc#default-configsources[Eclipse MicroProfile]\n-\n-NOTE: Environment variables without a configuration profile defined in `.env` file will overwrite all its related profiles in `application.properties`, e.g. `%test.application.value` is overwritten by `APPLICATION_VALUE` in `.env` file.\n-\n-NOTE: The `config/application.properties` features is available in development mode as well. To make use of it, `config/application.properties` needs to be placed inside the build tool's output directory (`target` for Maven and `build/classes/java/main` for Gradle).\n-Keep in mind however that any cleaning operation from the build tool like `mvn clean` or `gradle clean` will remove the `config` directory as well.\n-\n-=== Configuration Profiles\n-\n-Quarkus supports the notion of configuration profiles. These allow you to have multiple configuration in the same file and\n-select between them via a profile name.\n-\n-The syntax for this is `%{profile}.config.key=value`. For example if I have the following:\n-\n-[source,properties]\n-----\n-quarkus.http.port=9090\n-%dev.quarkus.http.port=8181\n-----\n-\n-The Quarkus HTTP port will be 9090, unless the `dev` profile is active, in which case it will be 8181.\n-\n-To use profiles in the `.env` file, you can follow a `_{PROFILE}_CONFIG_KEY=value` pattern. An equivalent of the above example in an `.env` file would be:\n-\n-[source,.env]\n-----\n-QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=9090\n-_DEV_QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=8181\n-----\n-\n-By default Quarkus has three profiles, although it is possible to use as many as you like. The default profiles are:\n-\n-* *dev* - Activated when in development mode (i.e. `quarkus:dev`)\n-* *test* - Activated when running tests\n-* *prod* - The default profile when not running in development or test mode\n-\n-There are two ways to set a custom profile, either via the `quarkus.profile` system property or the `QUARKUS_PROFILE`\n-environment variable. If both are set the system property takes precedence. Note that it is not necessary to\n-define the names of these profiles anywhere, all that is necessary is to create a config property with the profile\n-name, and then set the current profile to that name. For example if I want a `staging` profile with a different HTTP port\n-I can add the following to `application.properties`:\n-\n-[source,properties]\n-----\n-quarkus.http.port=9090\n-%staging.quarkus.http.port=9999\n-----\n-\n-And then set the `QUARKUS_PROFILE` environment variable to `staging` to activate my profile.\n-\n-[NOTE]\n-====\n-The proper way to check the active profile programmatically is to use the `getActiveProfile` method of `io.quarkus.runtime.configuration.ProfileManager`.\n-\n-Using `@ConfigProperty(\"quarkus.profile\")` will *not* work properly.\n-====\n-\n-=== Using Property Expressions\n-\n-Quarkus supports the use of property expressions in the `application.properties` file.\n-\n-These expressions are resolved when the property is read.\n-So if your configuration property is a build time configuration property, the property expression will be resolved at build time.\n-If your configuration property is overridable at runtime, the property expression will be resolved at runtime.\n-\n-You can use property expressions both for the Quarkus configuration or for your own configuration properties.\n-\n-Property expressions are defined this way: `${my-property-expression}`.\n-\n-For example, having the following property:\n-\n-[source,properties]\n-----\n-remote.host=quarkus.io\n-----\n-and another property defined as:\n-\n-[source,properties]\n-----\n-callable.url=https://${remote.host}/\n-----\n-\n-will result in the value of the `callable.url` property being set to:\n-\n-[source,properties]\n-----\n-callable.url=https://quarkus.io/\n-----\n-\n-Another example would be defining different database servers depending on the profile used:\n-\n-[source,properties]\n-----\n-%dev.quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n-quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://remotehost:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n-----\n-\n-can be simplified by having:\n-\n-[source,properties]\n-----\n-%dev.application.server=localhost\n-application.server=remotehost\n-\n-quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://${application.server}:3306/mydatabase?useSSL=false\n-----\n-\n-It does result in one more line in this example but the value of `application.server` can be reused in other properties,\n-diminishing the possibility of typos and providing more flexibility in property definitions.\n-\n-[#combine-property-env-var]\n-=== Combining Property Expressions and Environment Variables\n-\n-Quarkus also supports the combination of both property expressions and environment variables.\n-\n-Let's assume you have following property defined in `application.properties`:\n-\n-[source,properties]\n-----\n-remote.host=quarkus.io\n-----\n-\n-You can combine environment variables and property expressions by having a property defined as follows:\n-\n-[source,properties]\n-----\n-application.host=${HOST:${remote.host}}\n-----\n-\n-This will expand the `HOST` environment variable and use the value of the property `remote.host` as the default value if `HOST` is not set.\n-\n-For the purpose of this section we used the property `remote.host` we defined previously.\n-It has to be noted that the value could have been a fixed one such as in:\n-\n-[source,properties]\n-----\n-application.host=${HOST:localhost}\n-----\n-\n-which will result in `localhost` as the default value if `HOST` is not set.\n-\n-=== Clearing properties\n-\n-Run time properties which are optional, and which have had values set at build time or which have a default value,\n-may be explicitly cleared by assigning an empty string to the property.  Note that this will _only_ affect\n-run time properties, and will _only_ work with properties whose values are not required.\n-\n-The property may be cleared by setting the corresponding `application.properties` property, setting the\n-corresponding system property, or setting the corresponding environment variable.\n-\n-==== Miscellaneous\n-The default Quarkus application runtime profile is set to the profile used to build the application.\n-For example:\n-[source,bash]\n-----\n-./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.profile=prod-aws\n-./target/my-app-1.0-runner // <1>\n-----\n-<1> The command will run with the `prod-aws` profile. This can be overridden using the `quarkus.profile` system property.\n-\n-== Custom Configuration\n-\n-=== Custom configuration sources\n-\n-You can also introduce custom configuration sources in the standard MicroProfile Config manner.  To\n-do this, you must provide a class which implements either `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.ConfigSource`\n-or `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.ConfigSourceProvider`.  Create a\n-https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html[service file] for the\n-class and it will be detected and installed at application startup.\n-\n-=== Custom configuration converters\n-\n-You can also use your custom types as a configuration values. This can be done by implementing `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter<T>`\n-and adding its fully qualified class name in the `META-INF/services/org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter` file.\n-\n-Let us assume you have a custom type like this one:\n-\n-[source,java]\n-----\n-package org.acme.config;\n-\n-public class MicroProfileCustomValue {\n-\n-    private final int number;\n-\n-    public MicroProfileCustomValue(int number) {\n-        this.number = number;\n-    }\n-\n-    public int getNumber() {\n-        return number;\n-    }\n-}\n-----\n-\n-The corresponding converter will look like the one below. Please note that your custom converter class must be `public` and must have\n-a `public` no-argument constructor. It also must not be `abstract`.\n-\n-\n-[source,java]\n-----\n-package org.acme.config;\n-\n-import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter;\n-\n-public class MicroProfileCustomValueConverter implements Converter<MicroProfileCustomValue> {\n-\n-    @Override\n-    public MicroProfileCustomValue convert(String value) {\n-        return new MicroProfileCustomValue(Integer.valueOf(value));\n-    }\n-}\n-----\n-\n-Then you need to include the fully qualified class name of the converter in a service file `META-INF/services/org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter`.\n-If you have more converters, simply add their class names in this file as well. Single fully qualified class name per line, for example:\n-\n-[source]\n-----\n-org.acme.config.MicroProfileCustomValueConverter\n-org.acme.config.SomeOtherConverter\n-org.acme.config.YetAnotherConverter\n-----\n-\n-Please note that `SomeOtherConverter` and `YetAnotherConverter` were added just for a demonstration. If you include in this file classes\n-which are not available at runtime, the converters loading will fail.\n-\n-After this is done you can use your custom type as a configuration value:\n-\n-[source,java]\n-----\n-@ConfigProperty(name = \"configuration.value.name\")\n-MicroProfileCustomValue value;\n-----\n-\n-==== Converter priority\n-\n-In some cases, you may want to use a custom converter to convert a type which is already converted\n-by a different converter. In such cases, you can use the `javax.annotation.Priority` annotation to\n-change converters precedence and make your custom converter of higher priority than the other\n-on the list.\n-\n-By default, if no `@Priority` can be found on a converter, it's registered with a priority of 100\n-and all Quarkus core converters are registered with a priority of 200, so depending on which\n-converter you would like to replace, you need to set a higher value.\n-\n-To demonstrate the idea let us implement a custom converter which will take precedence over\n-`MicroProfileCustomValueConverter` implemented in the previous example.\n-\n-[source,java]\n-----\n-package org.acme.config;\n-\n-import javax.annotation.Priority;\n-import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter;\n-\n-@Priority(150)\n-public class MyCustomConverter implements Converter<MicroProfileCustomValue> {\n-\n-    @Override\n-    public MicroProfileCustomValue convert(String value) {\n-\n-        final int secretNumber;\n-        if (value.startsFrom(\"OBF:\")) {\n-            secretNumber = Integer.valueOf(SecretDecoder.decode(value));\n-        } else {\n-            secretNumber = Integer.valueOf(value);\n-        }\n-\n-        return new MicroProfileCustomValue(secretNumber);\n-    }\n-}\n-----\n-\n-Since it converts the same value type (namely `MicroProfileCustomValue`) and has a priority\n-of 150, it will be used instead of a `MicroProfileCustomValueConverter` which has a default\n-priority of 100.\n-\n-NOTE: This new converter also needs to be listed in a service file, i.e. `META-INF/services/org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter`.\n-\n-[[yaml]]\n-== YAML for Configuration\n-\n-=== Add YAML Config Support\n-\n-You might want to use YAML over properties for configuration.\n-Since link:https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-config[SmallRye Config] brings support for YAML\n-configuration, Quarkus supports this as well.\n-\n-First you will need to add the YAML extension to your `pom.xml`:\n-\n-[source,xml]\n-----\n-<dependency>\n-    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>\n-    <artifactId>quarkus-config-yaml</artifactId>\n-</dependency>\n-----\n-\n-Or you can alternatively run this command in the directory containing your Quarkus project:\n-\n-[source,bash]\n-----\n-./mvnw quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions=\"config-yaml\"\n-----\n-\n-Now Quarkus can read YAML configuration files.\n-The config directories and priorities are the same as before.\n-\n-NOTE: Quarkus will choose an `application.yaml` over an `application.properties`.\n-YAML files are just an alternative way to configure your application.\n-You should decide and keep one configuration type to avoid errors.\n-\n-==== Configuration Examples\n-[source,yaml]\n-----\n-# YAML supports comments\n-quarkus:\n-  datasource:\n-    db-kind: postgresql\n-    jdbc:\n-      url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/some-database\n-    username: quarkus\n-    password: quarkus\n-\n-# REST Client configuration property\n-org:\n-  acme:\n-    restclient:\n-      CountriesService/mp-rest/url: https://restcountries.eu/rest\n-\n-# For configuration property names that use quotes, do not split the string inside the quotes.\n-quarkus:\n-  log:\n-    category:\n-      \"io.quarkus.category\":\n-        level: INFO\n-----\n-\n-[NOTE]\n-====\n-Quarkus also supports using `application.yml` as the name of the YAML file.

If not set then the prefix to be used will be determined by the class name. In this case it would still be `greeting` (since the `Configuration` suffix is removed). If the class were named `GreetingExtraConfiguration` then the resulting default prefix would be `greeting-extra`.\n-<2> `!` will be the default value if `greeting.suffix` is not set\n-\n-This class could then be injected into the `GreetingResource` using the familiar CDI `@Inject` annotation like so:\n-\n-[source,java]\n-----\n-@Inject\n-GreetingConfiguration greetingConfiguration;\n-----\n-\n-Another alternative style provided by Quarkus is to create `GreetingConfiguration` as an interface like so:\n-\n-[source,java]\n-----\n-package org.acme.config;\n-\n-import io.quarkus.arc.config.ConfigProperties;\n-import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.inject.ConfigProperty;\n-import java.util.Optional;\n-\n-@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n-public interface GreetingConfiguration {\n-\n-    @ConfigProperty(name = \"message\") <1>\n-    String message();\n-\n-    @ConfigProperty(defaultValue = \"!\")\n-    String getSuffix(); <2>\n-\n-    Optional<String> getName(); <3>\n-}\n-----\n-<1> The `@ConfigProperty` annotation is needed because the name of the configuration property that the method corresponds to doesn't follow the getter method naming conventions\n-<2> In this case since `name` was not set, the corresponding property will be `greeting.suffix`.\n-<3> It is unnecessary to specify the `@ConfigProperty` annotation because the method name follows the getter method naming conventions (`greeting.name` being the corresponding property) and no default value is needed.\n-\n-When using `@ConfigProperties` on a class or an interface, if the value of one of its fields is not provided, the application startup will fail and a `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.DeploymentException` indicating the missing value information will be thrown.\n-This does not apply to `Optional` fields and fields with a default value.\n+== Configuration Profiles\n \n-=== Additional notes on @ConfigProperties\n+Quarkus supports the notion of configuration profiles. \n+These allow you to have multiple configuration values in the same file and select between them via a profile name.\n \n-When using a regular class annotated with `@ConfigProperties` the class doesn't necessarily have to declare getters and setters.\n-Having simple public non-final fields is valid as well.\n-\n-Furthermore, the configuration classes support nested object configuration. Suppose there was a need to have an extra layer\n-of greeting configuration named `content` that would contain a few fields. This could be achieved like so:\n-\n-[source,java]\n-----\n-@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n-public class GreetingConfiguration {\n-\n-    public String message;\n-    public String suffix = \"!\";\n-    public Optional<String> name;\n-    public ContentConfig content; <1>\n-\n-    public static class ContentConfig {\n-        public Integer prizeAmount;\n-        public List<String> recipients;\n-    }\n-}\n-----\n-<1> The name of the field (not the class name) will determine the name of the properties that are bound to the object.\n-\n-Setting the properties would occur in the normal manner, for example in `application.properties` one could have:\n+The syntax for this is `%{profile}.config.key=value`. For example if I have the following:\n \n [source,properties]\n ----\n-greeting.message = hello\n-greeting.name = quarkus\n-greeting.content.prize-amount=10\n-greeting.content.recipients=Jane,John\n-----\n-\n-Furthermore, classes annotated with `@ConfigProperties` can be annotated with Bean Validation annotations similar to the following example:\n-\n-[source,java]\n-----\n-@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n-public class GreetingConfiguration {\n-\n-    @Size(min = 20)\n-    public String message;\n-    public String suffix = \"!\";\n-\n-}\n-----\n-\n-WARNING: For validation to work, the `quarkus-hibernate-validator` extension needs to be present.\n-\n-If the validation fails with the given configuration, the application will fail to start and indicate the corresponding validation errors in the log.\n-\n-In the case of an interface being annotated with `@ConfigProperties`, the interface is allowed to extend other interfaces and methods from\n-the entire interface hierarchy are used to bind properties.\n-\n-=== Using same ConfigProperties with different prefixes\n-\n-Quarkus also supports the use of the same `@ConfigProperties` object with different prefixes for each injection point using the `io.quarkus.arc.config.@ConfigPrefix` annotation.\n-Say for example that `GreetingConfiguration` from above needs to be used for both the `greeting` prefix and the `other` prefix.\n-In that case the code would look like so:\n-\n-`GreetingConfiguration.java`\n-[source,java]\n-----\n-@ConfigProperties(prefix = \"greeting\")\n-public class GreetingConfiguration {\n-\n-    @Size(min = 20)\n-    public String message;\n-    public String suffix = \"!\";\n-\n-}\n-----\n-\n-`SomeBean.java`\n-[source,java]\n+quarkus.http.port=9090\n+%dev.quarkus.http.port=8181\n ----\n-@ApplicationScoped\n-public class SomeBean {\n \n-    @Inject <1>\n-    GreetingConfiguration greetingConfiguration;\n+Then the Quarkus HTTP port will be 9090, unless the `dev` profile is active, in which case it will be 8181.\n \n-    @ConfigPrefix(\"other\") <2>\n-    GreetingConfiguration otherConfiguration;\n-\n-}\n-----\n-<1> At this injection point `greetingConfiguration` will use the `greeting` prefix since that is what has been defined on `@ConfigProperties`.\n-<2> At this injection point `otherConfiguration` will use the `other` prefix from `@ConfigPrefix` instead of the `greeting` prefix. Notice that in this case `@Inject` is not required.\n+See the <<config-reference.adoc#configuration_profiles,configuration reference guide>> for more information about configuration profiles.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "8db2a006915902929439f7b14ff4b7c998e5fd1c"}, "originalPosition": 286}]}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 3980, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-13T14:23:39Z"}}}
