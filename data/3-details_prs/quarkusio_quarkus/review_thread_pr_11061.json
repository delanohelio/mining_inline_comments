It does not attempt to work on ljdk8 but that's a legacy release of OpenJDK which most Quarkus users will have no good reason to adopt and for which, in consequence, we have no commitment to support Quarkus beyond best effort. In other words, mandrel streamlines and simplifies the build, test, release and support cycle for most of our users, especially those who pay for support.\nNote that we are not forcing anyone's hand here.

The sources get compiled by the java version outside the container. If you're on Windows/macOS you can set a JAVA_HOME to Mandrel cos there's no distribution for that. On linux you could download Mandrel and set Java home to that (in the absence of fedora RPMs...etc), but that's as far as you can say.
