If you're certain about that, I will definitely change this setting.\nFrom what I've seen with Elasticsearch... in raw throughput tests, where we just push everything we can to the index, and there is only one Elasticsearch instance, you're absolutely right. Less connections is even better, probably because it means larger bulks and those are better handled by Elasticsearch.\nHowever, when I spin up a complete application with database access, with 2 (local) Elasticsearch nodes, and I start mass indexing, I witnessed the opposite: jumping from 2 queues to 10 queues gave a +50% throughput increase in a small local test (~25000 wikipedia pages) I performed. Granted there's nothing scientific to that test, but it's at least enough to give pause about whether \"more connections is pointless\".\nThere are other things that come into play, I suppose; maybe optimizing the global indexing time while allowing high latency from time to time for some documents is not what works best in all situations.\n\nThis also makes me wonder why we expose this.\n\nBecause I can't come up with defaults that will work for the most common setup (which is it, by the way?), much less for everyone.

documentation](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#mapper-orm-schema-management)\nfor detailed documentation about schema management.\n\nIn short:\n\n* `quarkus.hibernate-search.elasticsearch.index_defaults.lifecycle.strategy`\nis now `quarkus.hibernate-search.schema-management.strategy`\nand accepts the same values as before: `none`, `create`, `validate`, `update`, ...\n* A new schema management strategy on startup was introduced: `create-or-validate`.\nIt create indexes if they don't exist, validates their schema if they already exist.\n* The default schema management strategy on startup is now `create-or-validate`.\n*  `quarkus.hibernate-search.elasticsearch.index_defaults.lifecycle.required_status`\nis now `quarkus.hibernate-search.elasticsearch.index_defaults.schema_management.required_status`.\n*  `quarkus.hibernate-search.elasticsearch.index_defaults.lifecycle.required_status_wait_timeout`\nis now `quarkus.hibernate-search.elasticsearch.index_defaults.schema_management.required_status_wait_timeout`.\n\nAlso related: you can now use [`SearchSchemaManager` APIs](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#mapper-orm-schema-management-manager)\nto trigger schema management operations at the time of your choosing (not just on startup).", "url": "https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/8328#discussion_r404009101", "createdAt": "2020-04-06T11:09:23Z", "author": {"login": "yrodiere"}, "path":
