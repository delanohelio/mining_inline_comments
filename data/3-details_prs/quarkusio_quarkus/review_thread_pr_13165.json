The difference between what we have in Quarkus (what you created) and in SB and likely other providers is that here we have a very user centric interface which is unique enough for Quarkus; the interfaces like this one where whatever is available in a given Vault engine is mixed up in the same interface do not impress me :-), it is just the enumeration of all the operations, not the best approach IMHO.\nI don't want to make this PR delayed etc, just a general consideration which I'd consider applying myself.\nRe VaultAdminTransitSecretEngine - IMHO it would offer the right separation of concerns. I reckon it is fair enough to assume that no-one will for example create a secret key and then use it to sign/encrypt something in context of a single client request (executed in a server context) - as it will require 2 background remote operations - we'd have either some management service where these keys are provisioned or a user service where they are used.\nThe only concern I'd have about VaultAdminTransitSecretEngine is that we'd end up with twice as many interfaces as we have now, if we do it per every other interface. But the separation of the concerns seems more important. These inerfaces can sit in a admin sub-package for example and even extend the simple ones, ex, VaultAdminTransitSecretEngine extends VaultTransitSecretEngine...\nIs it convincing enough :-) ? It is really a proposal to discuss as opposed to a review change request as I agree that it will work in the current PR form too\nthanks", "url": "https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/13165#discussion_r520673255", "createdAt": "2020-11-10T15:56:23Z", "author": {"login": "sberyozkin"}, "path": "extensions/vault/runtime/src/main/java/io/quarkus/vault/VaultTransitSecretEngine.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -202,11 +205,67 @@\n      * against, and an optional transit context used for key derivation, if applicable.\n      * If the signature does not match, or if any other error occurs,\n      * the service will throw a {@link VaultVerificationBatchException}\n-     * \n-     * @see <a href=\"https://www.vaultproject.io/api/secret/transit/index.html#verify-signed-data\">verify signed data</a>\n+     *\n      * @param keyName the key that was used to sign the input\n      * @param requests a list of items specifying an input and a signature to match against\n+     * @see <a href=\"https://www.vaultproject.io/api/secret/transit/index.html#verify-signed-data\">verify signed data</a>\n      */\n     void verifySignature(String keyName, List<VerificationRequest> requests);\n \n+    // --- admin operations", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxOTc2MjExOQ=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "964f248d02c0574429100702bed69a8f812ddbe3"}, "originalPosition": 240}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyMDczNjg0MA==", "bodyText": "yes, I guess it is a matter\n\nof sticking to the original api to avoid surprising the users (after all hashicorp did not create 2 interfaces admin/non-admin, and sometimes it is difficult to figure out which is which - is readSecret non-admin, and writeSecret admin? - today we both have them in VaultKVSecretEngine and that feels right),\nor creating another abstraction to provide a clearer separation of concerns that we determine was missing in the original api, and would undermine clarity for the users.\n\nin that case, I was leaning toward the first option, because as a user, if I decided to use the transit secret engine, I would search for a class with that name and expect everything to be there. but again there is no right or wrong. it would be nice to have a third opinion. @gsmet?\nno strong feeling on my side if a separation of interfaces means better respecting the quarkus philosophy, just a preference for consistency against the original api. but I will do whatever you guys believe is right for the product.", "url": "https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/13165#discussion_r520736840", "createdAt": "2020-11-10T17:22:24Z", "author": {"login": "vsevel"}, "path": "extensions/vault/runtime/src/main/java/io/quarkus/vault/VaultTransitSecretEngine.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -202,11 +205,67 @@\n      * against, and an optional transit context used for key derivation, if applicable.\n      * If the signature does not match, or if any other error occurs,\n      * the service will throw a {@link VaultVerificationBatchException}\n-     * \n-     * @see <a href=\"https://www.vaultproject.io/api/secret/transit/index.html#verify-signed-data\">verify signed data</a>\n+     *\n      * @param keyName the key that was used to sign the input\n      * @param requests a list of items specifying an input and a signature to match against\n+     * @see <a href=\"https://www.vaultproject.io/api/secret/transit/index.html#verify-signed-data\">verify signed data</a>\n      */\n     void verifySignature(String keyName, List<VerificationRequest> requests);\n \n+    // --- admin operations", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxOTc2MjExOQ=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "964f248d02c0574429100702bed69a8f812ddbe3"}, "originalPosition": 240}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyMjkzMTQ1Nw==", "bodyText": "Hi @vsevel\nYeah, they have the endpoint and it is indeed simpler for them to just have a single endpoint dealing with all the operations.\nHave a look at VaultClient.
