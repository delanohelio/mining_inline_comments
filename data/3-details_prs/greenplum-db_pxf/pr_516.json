For example, when installing PXF as user `gpadmin` under `/usr/local/greenplum-db`:\n \n ```bash\n export GPHOME=/usr/local/greenplum-db\n export PXF_HOME=/usr/local/pxf\n+export PXF_BASE=${HOME}/pxf-boot\n chown -R gpadmin:gpadmin \"${GPHOME}\" \"${PXF_HOME}\"\n make -C ~/workspace/pxf install\n ```\n \n+NOTE: if `PXF_BASE` is not set, it will default to `PXF_HOME`, and server configurations, libraries or other configurations, might get deleted after a PXF re-install.\n+\n+## How to Run PXF locally\n+\n+Ensure that PXF is in your path. This command can be added to your .bashrc\n+```bash\n+export PATH=/usr/local/pxf/bin:$PATH\n+```\n+\n+Then you can prepare and start up PXF by doing the following.\n+```bash\n+pxf prepare\n+pxf start\n+```\n+If `${HOME}/pxf-boot` does not exist, `pxf prepare` will create the directory for you. This command should only need to be run once.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "64a23037b031c41c39913ed77eefab030bab8e4a"}, "originalPosition": 31}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU1NjE5Mjk5OA==", "bodyText": "Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n            cp ${PXF_HOME}/templates/{hdfs,mapred,yarn,core,hbase,hive}-site.xml ${PXF_BASE}/servers/default\n          \n          \n            \n            cp ${PXF_HOME}/templates/*-site.xml ${PXF_BASE}/servers/default\n          \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\nto also copy pxf-site.xml", "url": "https://github.com/greenplum-db/pxf/pull/516#discussion_r556192998", "createdAt": "2021-01-13T00:54:43Z", "author": {"login": "denalex"}, "path": "README.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -132,37 +162,31 @@ cd ~/workspace\n tar xzf singlecluster-HDP.tar.gz\n ```\n \n-# Development With Docker\n-NOTE: Since the docker container will house all Single cluster Hadoop, Greenplum and PXF, we recommend that you have at least 4 cpus and 6GB memory allocated to Docker.
