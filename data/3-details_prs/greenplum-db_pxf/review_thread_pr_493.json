For example, you can assign the PXF default server to a Hadoop cluster, or to a MySQL database that your users frequently access.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "64b897fe93ae0f8063a8b59e547847202b2924b3"}, "originalPosition": 30}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMzMwMDU1Mzk4OnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "docs/content/ref/pxf-cluster.html.md.erb", "isResolved": true, "comments": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0xOFQyMTowNjowMlrOH2CIpA==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0xOFQyMjo1MDo1OVrOH2FkNA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyNjQyMDEzMg==", "bodyText": "I assume pxf migrate will be documented later.", "url": "https://github.com/greenplum-db/pxf/pull/493#discussion_r526420132", "createdAt": "2020-11-18T21:06:02Z", "author": {"login": "frankgh"}, "path": "docs/content/ref/pxf-cluster.html.md.erb", "diffHunk": "@@ -15,6 +15,7 @@ where `<command>` is:\n ``` pre\n help\n init\n+prepare", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "64b897fe93ae0f8063a8b59e547847202b2924b3"}, "originalPosition": 4}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyNjQ3NjM0MA==", "bodyText": "yes, will document pxf migrate in a later PR.", "url": "https://github.com/greenplum-db/pxf/pull/493#discussion_r526476340", "createdAt": "2020-11-18T22:50:59Z", "author": {"login": "lisakowen"}, "path": "docs/content/ref/pxf-cluster.html.md.erb", "diffHunk": "@@ -15,6 +15,7 @@ where `<command>` is:\n ``` pre\n help\n init\n+prepare", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyNjQyMDEzMg=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "64b897fe93ae0f8063a8b59e547847202b2924b3"}, "originalPosition": 4}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMzMwMDU3NjAwOnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "docs/content/troubleshooting_pxf.html.md.erb", "isResolved": true, "comments": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0xOFQyMToxMjoxN1rOH2CV1Q==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0xOFQyMjo1MToyM1rOH2FkzA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyNjQyMzUwOQ==", "bodyText": "we have a single log file now, it's called pxf-service.log by default. maybe out of scope of this PR though", "url": "https://github.com/greenplum-db/pxf/pull/493#discussion_r526423509", "createdAt": "2020-11-18T21:12:17Z", "author": {"login": "frankgh"}, "path": "docs/content/troubleshooting_pxf.html.md.erb", "diffHunk": "@@ -146,7 +146,7 @@ By default, PXF is configured such that when the PXF JVM detects an out of memor\n \n When auto-kill is enabled and the PXF JVM detects an OOM condition and kills the PXF server on the segment host:\n \n-- PXF logs the following messages to `$PXF_CONF/logs/catalina.out` on the segment host:\n+- PXF logs the following messages to `$PXF_BASE/logs/catalina.out` on the segment host:", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "64b897fe93ae0f8063a8b59e547847202b2924b3"}, "originalPosition": 32}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyNjQ3NjQ5Mg==", "bodyText": "will address log-related changes in a separate PR.", "url": "https://github.com/greenplum-db/pxf/pull/493#discussion_r526476492", "createdAt": "2020-11-18T22:51:23Z", "author": {"login": "lisakowen"}, "path": "docs/content/troubleshooting_pxf.html.md.erb", "diffHunk": "@@ -146,7 +146,7 @@ By default, PXF is configured such that when the PXF JVM detects an out of memor\n \n When auto-kill is enabled and the PXF JVM detects an OOM condition and kills the PXF server on the segment host:\n \n-- PXF logs the following messages to `$PXF_CONF/logs/catalina.out` on the segment host:\n+- PXF logs the following messages to `$PXF_BASE/logs/catalina.out` on the segment host:", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyNjQyMzUwOQ=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "64b897fe93ae0f8063a8b59e547847202b2924b3"}, "originalPosition": 32}]}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 3544, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-12T20:28:25Z"}}}
