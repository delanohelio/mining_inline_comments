These are dependencies of the declared dependencies. Projects that rely on indirect dependencies tend to break in unexpected ways when direct dependencies are upgraded. \n+\n+For example, your project might declare a dependency on the \n+Google HTTP Java Client which\n+itself depends on the Apache HTTP Components. If so, it is possible to use the `org.apache.http.client.utils.URLEncodedUtils` class in your own project without\n+explicitly declaring a dependency on Apache HTTP Components. However, you should\n+add the dependency anyway. This way if a future version of the\n+Google HTTP Java Client no longer depends on Apache HTTP Components, your code\n+still compiles. Strict dependencies also help static analysis tools better understand a project.\n+\n+This doesn't only happen when a project itself is upgraded. It can also\n+happen when dependency mediation selects a different version of a library's dependency \n+that does not include the necessary indirect dependency.
