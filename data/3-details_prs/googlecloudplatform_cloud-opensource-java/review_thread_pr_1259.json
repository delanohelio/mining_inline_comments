Note: Our focus is on build systems based on the Maven\n+repository system, so we ignore other build environments like Eclipse and Ant\n+that work differently.\n+\n+Before we look at Maven and Gradle specifically, we need to understand what\n+happens in the version resolution process. The input of this process is a\n+dependency graph which reflects the dependencies as specified by each library in\n+the graph, which we call an *unresolved dependency graph*. In such a graph, there\n+can be multiple versions of each library. The version resolution process walks\n+the unresolved dependency graph and decides which version to use for every\n+library encountered. Whether or not the build tool produces a graph as an output\n+of this resolution, it is useful to think of this output in terms of a new\n+graph. We call the graph representation of this output a *resolved dependency\n+graph*. Here is a visual representation of the process:\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-00.png\">\n+\n+For example, we could have an unresolved graph that looks like this:\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-01.png\">\n+\n+In this graph, there are two versions of A (10.0 and 10.1). The version\n+resolution process picks a single version for A, which could be either version\n+depending on the algorithm. If A:10.0 is picked, the resolved dependency graph\n+looks like the following. In this graph, C's dependency on A:10.1 is overridden.\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-02.png\">\n+\n+If A:10.1 is picked, the resolved dependency graph looks like the following. In\n+this graph, B's dependency on A:10.0 is overridden.\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-03.png\">\n+\n+So why do we need to pick a single version? The reason is that Java's default\n+class loader only loads one version of each fully-qualified class name at\n+runtime. So, if you try to put multiple versions on the classpath, you would not\n+get both versions at runtime. Java build systems handle this issue upfront by\n+picking a single version for each library before the classpath is even\n+constructed.\n+\n+Now let's look at the version resolution algorithms used by Gradle and\n+Maven. Let's consider Gradle first because it is the simpler one to\n+describe. Simply put, Gradle chooses the highest version encountered in your\n+dependency graph. For the example above, Gradle would pick A:10.1.\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-04.png\">\n+\n+Gradle applies the higher-version rule even if it overrides one of your own\n+direct dependency declarations:\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-05.png\">\n+\n+Next let's consider Maven. Maven chooses the version that is closest to the root\n+of the dependency graph, and if there is a tie, then it chooses the version it\n+encounters first. Another way to describe the algorithm is that Maven chooses\n+the first version encountered when traversing the dependency graph following a\n+breadth-first traversal. Looking at the same example we used first for Gradle:\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-06.png\">\n+\n+As you can see if you compare the resolved graphs, Maven makes the opposite", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "14b2872ab465584a2eb3a99b57dbefaa980e563e"}, "originalPosition": 73}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4NTkwNDE0MA==", "bodyText": "Ok.", "url": "https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-opensource-java/pull/1259#discussion_r385904140", "createdAt": "2020-02-28T20:19:59Z", "author": {"login": "garrettjonesgoogle"}, "path": "docs/how-does-version-resolution-work-in-maven-and-gradle.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,121 @@\n+# How does version resolution work in Maven and Gradle?\n+\n+The build system that you choose for building your Java code determines which\n+version resolution algorithm is used to choose the versions of your\n+dependencies.

Note: Our focus is on build systems based on the Maven\n+repository system, so we ignore other build environments like Eclipse and Ant\n+that work differently.\n+\n+Before we look at Maven and Gradle specifically, we need to understand what\n+happens in the version resolution process. The input of this process is a\n+dependency graph which reflects the dependencies as specified by each library in\n+the graph, which we call an *unresolved dependency graph*. In such a graph, there\n+can be multiple versions of each library. The version resolution process walks\n+the unresolved dependency graph and decides which version to use for every\n+library encountered. Whether or not the build tool produces a graph as an output\n+of this resolution, it is useful to think of this output in terms of a new\n+graph. We call the graph representation of this output a *resolved dependency\n+graph*. Here is a visual representation of the process:\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-00.png\">\n+\n+For example, we could have an unresolved graph that looks like this:\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-01.png\">\n+\n+In this graph, there are two versions of A (10.0 and 10.1). The version\n+resolution process picks a single version for A, which could be either version\n+depending on the algorithm. If A:10.0 is picked, the resolved dependency graph\n+looks like the following. In this graph, C's dependency on A:10.1 is overridden.\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-02.png\">\n+\n+If A:10.1 is picked, the resolved dependency graph looks like the following. In\n+this graph, B's dependency on A:10.0 is overridden.\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-03.png\">\n+\n+So why do we need to pick a single version? The reason is that Java's default\n+class loader only loads one version of each fully-qualified class name at\n+runtime. So, if you try to put multiple versions on the classpath, you would not\n+get both versions at runtime. Java build systems handle this issue upfront by\n+picking a single version for each library before the classpath is even\n+constructed.\n+\n+Now let's look at the version resolution algorithms used by Gradle and\n+Maven. Let's consider Gradle first because it is the simpler one to\n+describe. Simply put, Gradle chooses the highest version encountered in your\n+dependency graph. For the example above, Gradle would pick A:10.1.\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-04.png\">\n+\n+Gradle applies the higher-version rule even if it overrides one of your own\n+direct dependency declarations:\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-05.png\">\n+\n+Next let's consider Maven. Maven chooses the version that is closest to the root\n+of the dependency graph, and if there is a tie, then it chooses the version it\n+encounters first. Another way to describe the algorithm is that Maven chooses\n+the first version encountered when traversing the dependency graph following a\n+breadth-first traversal.

Unfortunately, the two most popular build systems in open source\n+(Maven and Gradle) use different version resolution algorithms. They also use\n+different names for the concept: Maven calls the process *dependency mediation*,\n+while Gradle calls the process *version conflict resolution*. In this article,\n+we will use the term *version resolution*, omitting the word \"conflict\" so that\n+the process it not confused with program-breaking conflicts that we discuss\n+elsewhere. No matter which build system you choose, you are likely to have\n+direct or indirect dependencies that use the other one, so you need to\n+understand how both work. Note: Our focus is on build systems based on the Maven\n+repository system, so we ignore other build environments like Eclipse and Ant\n+that work differently.\n+\n+Before we look at Maven and Gradle specifically, we need to understand what\n+happens in the version resolution process. The input of this process is a\n+dependency graph which reflects the dependencies as specified by each library in\n+the graph, which we call an *unresolved dependency graph*. In such a graph, there\n+can be multiple versions of each library. The version resolution process walks\n+the unresolved dependency graph and decides which version to use for every\n+library encountered. Whether or not the build tool produces a graph as an output\n+of this resolution, it is useful to think of this output in terms of a new\n+graph. We call the graph representation of this output a *resolved dependency\n+graph*. Here is a visual representation of the process:\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-00.png\">\n+\n+For example, we could have an unresolved graph that looks like this:\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-01.png\">\n+\n+In this graph, there are two versions of A (10.0 and 10.1). The version\n+resolution process picks a single version for A, which could be either version\n+depending on the algorithm. If A:10.0 is picked, the resolved dependency graph\n+looks like the following. In this graph, C's dependency on A:10.1 is overridden.\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-02.png\">\n+\n+If A:10.1 is picked, the resolved dependency graph looks like the following. In\n+this graph, B's dependency on A:10.0 is overridden.\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-03.png\">\n+\n+So why do we need to pick a single version? The reason is that Java's default\n+class loader only loads one version of each fully-qualified class name at\n+runtime. So, if you try to put multiple versions on the classpath, you would not\n+get both versions at runtime. Java build systems handle this issue upfront by\n+picking a single version for each library before the classpath is even\n+constructed.\n+\n+Now let's look at the version resolution algorithms used by Gradle and\n+Maven. Let's consider Gradle first because it is the simpler one to\n+describe. Simply put, Gradle chooses the highest version encountered in your\n+dependency graph. For the example above, Gradle would pick A:10.1.\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-04.png\">\n+\n+Gradle applies the higher-version rule even if it overrides one of your own\n+direct dependency declarations:\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-05.png\">\n+\n+Next let's consider Maven. Maven chooses the version that is closest to the root\n+of the dependency graph, and if there is a tie, then it chooses the version it\n+encounters first. Another way to describe the algorithm is that Maven chooses\n+the first version encountered when traversing the dependency graph following a\n+breadth-first traversal. Looking at the same example we used first for Gradle:\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-06.png\">\n+\n+As you can see if you compare the resolved graphs, Maven makes the opposite\n+choice of Gradle in this circumstance. Let's look at the second example, where\n+the root has both a direct and indirect dependency on the same library:\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-07.png\">\n+\n+In this case, Maven chooses A:10.0 because it is only 1 hop away from the root\n+instead of 2 hops (A:10.1). In this case, Maven also makes the opposite choice\n+of Gradle.\n+\n+So where can the mixture of these two build systems cause a problem? The\n+resolved dependency graph can experience conflicts when the two build systems\n+come to different decisions for a particular subgraph of a dependency graph.\n+\n+Let's look at an example, starting with Gradle example 2, where library D\n+depends on A:10.0 and C:30.0 (and thus indirectly A:10.1). Let's also say that C\n+depends on a feature added into 10.1. This means that if 10.0 is selected as the\n+resolved version, then C will fail at runtime. From library D's perspective,\n+this is fine, since Gradle chooses version 10.1.\n+\n+Let's add a new library (let's call it library E) which uses Maven as its build\n+system, and which adds D as a dependency. When E is built, Maven will resolve\n+the whole dependency graph, including D's subgraph, even though Gradle resolved\n+the subgraph of D for itself when D was originally built. When Maven performs\n+its version resolution, it chooses a different version of A (10.0) than Gradle\n+did (10.1), which breaks C. This happens even though D works perfectly fine\n+internally.\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-08.png\">\n+\n+As a consequence, the author of library E might file a bug against library D\n+because it seems to have a bug. The author of library D would argue that there\n+is no bug from their perspective. From their narrow perspectives they are both\n+right. From the ecosystem perspective, the author of library D unfortunately\n+needs to adapt their dependencies so that they don't cause problems for Maven\n+consumers (even though they may have sworn off Maven and use Gradle\n+exclusively). In this case, they have an easy fix - they can upgrade the direct\n+dependency of D on A:10.0 to A:10.1, so that both build systems make the same", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4NTg5ODgyMw=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "14b2872ab465584a2eb3a99b57dbefaa980e563e"}, "originalPosition": 110}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMjM5MzE2MTg3OnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "docs/how-does-version-resolution-work-in-maven-and-gradle.md", "isResolved": false, "comments": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMy0wMlQxMToxNToyOFrOFwb6AQ==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMy0wM1QxNzo1MjoxNVrOFxQRLw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4NjMzMzE4NQ==", "bodyText": "delete \"in open source\" since these are used for closed source projects too", "url": "https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-opensource-java/pull/1259#discussion_r386333185", "createdAt": "2020-03-02T11:15:28Z", "author": {"login": "elharo"}, "path": "docs/how-does-version-resolution-work-in-maven-and-gradle.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,124 @@\n+# How does version resolution work in Maven and Gradle?\n+\n+The build system that you choose for building your Java code determines which\n+version resolution algorithm is used to choose the versions of your\n+dependencies.

Note: Our focus is on build systems based on the Maven\n+repository system, so we ignore other build environments like Eclipse and Ant\n+that work differently.\n+\n+Before we look at Maven and Gradle specifically, we need to understand what\n+happens in the version resolution process. The input of this process is a\n+dependency graph which reflects the dependencies as specified by each library in\n+the graph, which we call an *unresolved dependency graph*. In such a graph, there\n+can be multiple versions of each library. The version resolution process walks\n+the unresolved dependency graph and decides which version to use for every\n+library encountered. Whether or not the build tool produces a graph as an output\n+of this resolution, it is useful to think of this output in terms of a new\n+graph. We call the graph representation of this output a *resolved dependency\n+graph*. Here is a visual representation of the process:\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-00.png\">\n+\n+For example, we could have an unresolved graph that looks like this:\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-01.png\">\n+\n+In this graph, there are two versions of A (10.0 and 10.1). The version\n+resolution process picks a single version for A, which could be either version\n+depending on the algorithm. If A:10.0 is picked, the resolved dependency graph\n+looks like the following. In this graph, C's dependency on A:10.1 is overridden.\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-02.png\">\n+\n+If A:10.1 is picked, the resolved dependency graph looks like the following. In\n+this graph, B's dependency on A:10.0 is overridden.\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-03.png\">\n+\n+So why do we need to pick a single version? The reason is that Java's default\n+class loader only loads one version of each fully-qualified class name at\n+runtime.

Note: Our focus is on build systems based on the Maven\n+repository system, so we ignore other build environments like Eclipse and Ant\n+that work differently.\n+\n+Before we look at Maven and Gradle specifically, we need to understand what\n+happens in the version resolution process. The input of this process is a\n+dependency graph which reflects the dependencies as specified by each library in\n+the graph, which we call an *unresolved dependency graph*. In such a graph, there\n+can be multiple versions of each library. The version resolution process walks\n+the unresolved dependency graph and decides which version to use for every\n+library encountered. Whether or not the build tool produces a graph as an output\n+of this resolution, it is useful to think of this output in terms of a new\n+graph. We call the graph representation of this output a *resolved dependency\n+graph*. Here is a visual representation of the process:\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-00.png\">\n+\n+For example, we could have an unresolved graph that looks like this:\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-01.png\">\n+\n+In this graph, there are two versions of A (10.0 and 10.1). The version\n+resolution process picks a single version for A, which could be either version\n+depending on the algorithm. If A:10.0 is picked, the resolved dependency graph\n+looks like the following. In this graph, C's dependency on A:10.1 is overridden.\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-02.png\">\n+\n+If A:10.1 is picked, the resolved dependency graph looks like the following. In\n+this graph, B's dependency on A:10.0 is overridden.\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-03.png\">\n+\n+So why do we need to pick a single version? The reason is that Java's default\n+class loader only loads one version of each fully-qualified class name at\n+runtime. So, if you try to put multiple versions on the classpath, you would not\n+get both versions at runtime. Java build systems handle this issue upfront by\n+picking a single version for each library before the classpath is even\n+constructed.\n+\n+Now let's look at the version resolution algorithms used by Gradle and\n+Maven. Let's consider Gradle first because it is the simpler one to\n+describe. Simply put, Gradle chooses the highest version encountered in your\n+dependency graph. For the example above, Gradle would pick A:10.1.\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-04.png\">\n+\n+Gradle applies the higher-version rule even if it overrides one of your own\n+direct dependency declarations:\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-05.png\">\n+\n+Next let's consider Maven. Maven chooses the version that is closest to the root\n+of the dependency graph, and if there is a tie, then it chooses the version it\n+encounters first. Another way to describe the algorithm is that Maven chooses\n+the first version encountered when traversing the dependency graph following a\n+breadth-first traversal.

In\n+this graph, B's dependency on A:10.0 is overridden.\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-03.png\">\n+\n+So why do we need to pick a single version? The reason is that Java's default\n+class loader only loads one version of each fully-qualified class name at\n+runtime. So, if you try to put multiple versions on the classpath, you would not\n+get both versions at runtime. Java build systems handle this issue upfront by\n+picking a single version for each library before the classpath is even\n+constructed.\n+\n+Now let's look at the version resolution algorithms used by Gradle and\n+Maven. Let's consider Gradle first because it is the simpler one to\n+describe. Simply put, Gradle chooses the highest version encountered in your\n+dependency graph. For the example above, Gradle would pick A:10.1.\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-04.png\">\n+\n+Gradle applies the higher-version rule even if it overrides one of your own\n+direct dependency declarations:\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-05.png\">\n+\n+Next let's consider Maven. Maven chooses the version that is closest to the root\n+of the dependency graph, and if there is a tie, then it chooses the version it\n+encounters first. Another way to describe the algorithm is that Maven chooses\n+the first version encountered when traversing the dependency graph following a\n+breadth-first traversal. Looking at the same example we used first for Gradle:\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-06.png\">\n+\n+As you can see if you compare the resolved graphs, Maven makes the opposite\n+choice. Let's look at the second example, where the root has both a direct and\n+indirect dependency on the same library:\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-07.png\">\n+\n+In this case, Maven chooses A:10.0 because it is only 1 hop away from the root\n+instead of 2 hops (A:10.1). In this case, Maven also makes the opposite choice\n+of Gradle.\n+\n+## Interaction between Maven and Gradle\n+\n+Every time a library is built, its build system performs version resolution for\n+its entire dependency graph. Since the libraries in that dependency graph also\n+perform their own version resolution, the versions selected can be different,\n+especially when a consumer uses a different build system than its dependencies.\n+Sometimes, the version selected by the consumer can be incompatible with the\n+version selected by the dependency when the dependency is built by itself.\n+\n+Let's look at an example, starting with Gradle example 2, where library D\n+depends on A:10.0 and C:30.0 (and thus indirectly A:10.1).

We call the graph representation of this output a *resolved dependency\n+graph*. Here is a visual representation of the process:\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-00.png\">\n+\n+For example, we could have an unresolved graph that looks like this:\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-01.png\">\n+\n+In this graph, there are two versions of A (10.0 and 10.1).

For the example above, Gradle would pick A:10.1.\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-04.png\">\n+\n+Gradle applies the higher-version rule even if it overrides one of your own\n+direct dependency declarations:\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-05.png\">\n+\n+Next let's consider Maven.

Another way to describe the algorithm is that Maven chooses\n+the first version encountered when traversing the dependency graph following a\n+breadth-first traversal. Looking at the same example we used first for Gradle:\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-06.png\">\n+\n+As you can see if you compare the resolved graphs, Maven makes the opposite\n+choice.

Note: Our focus is on build systems based on the Maven\n+repository system, so we ignore other build environments like Eclipse and Ant\n+that work differently.\n+\n+Before we look at Maven and Gradle specifically, we need to understand what\n+happens in the version resolution process. The input of this process is a\n+dependency graph which reflects the dependencies as specified by each library in\n+the graph, which we call an *unresolved dependency graph*. In such a graph, there\n+can be multiple versions of each library. The version resolution process walks\n+the unresolved dependency graph and decides which version to use for every\n+library encountered. Whether or not the build tool produces a graph as an output\n+of this resolution, it is useful to think of this output in terms of a new\n+graph. We call the graph representation of this output a *resolved dependency\n+graph*. Here is a visual representation of the process:\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-00.png\">\n+\n+For example, we could have an unresolved graph that looks like this:\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-01.png\">\n+\n+In this graph, there are two versions of A (10.0 and 10.1). The version\n+resolution process picks a single version for A, which could be either version\n+depending on the algorithm. If A:10.0 is picked, the resolved dependency graph\n+looks like the following. In this graph, C's dependency on A:10.1 is overridden.\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-02.png\">\n+\n+If A:10.1 is picked, the resolved dependency graph looks like the following. In\n+this graph, B's dependency on A:10.0 is overridden.\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-03.png\">\n+\n+So why do we need to pick a single version? The reason is that Java's default\n+class loader only loads one version of each fully-qualified class name at\n+runtime. So, if you try to put multiple versions on the classpath, you would not\n+get both versions at runtime. Java build systems handle this issue upfront by\n+picking a single version for each library before the classpath is even\n+constructed.\n+\n+Now let's look at the version resolution algorithms used by Gradle and\n+Maven. Let's consider Gradle first because it is the simpler one to\n+describe. Simply put, Gradle chooses the highest version encountered in your\n+dependency graph. For the example above, Gradle would pick A:10.1.\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-04.png\">\n+\n+Gradle applies the higher-version rule even if it overrides one of your own\n+direct dependency declarations:\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-05.png\">\n+\n+Next let's consider Maven. Maven chooses the version that is closest to the root\n+of the dependency graph, and if there is a tie, then it chooses the version it\n+encounters first. Another way to describe the algorithm is that Maven chooses\n+the first version encountered when traversing the dependency graph following a\n+breadth-first traversal. Looking at the same example we used first for Gradle:\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-06.png\">\n+\n+As you can see if you compare the resolved graphs, Maven makes the opposite\n+choice. Let's look at the second example, where the root has both a direct and\n+indirect dependency on the same library:\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-07.png\">\n+\n+In this case, Maven chooses A:10.0 because it is only 1 hop away from the root\n+instead of 2 hops (A:10.1). In this case, Maven also makes the opposite choice\n+of Gradle.\n+\n+## Interaction between Maven and Gradle\n+\n+Every time a library is built, its build system performs version resolution for\n+its entire dependency graph. Since the libraries in that dependency graph also\n+perform their own version resolution, the versions selected can be different,\n+especially when a consumer uses a different build system than its dependencies.\n+Sometimes, the version selected by the consumer can be incompatible with the\n+version selected by the dependency when the dependency is built by itself.\n+\n+Let's look at an example, starting with Gradle example 2, where library D\n+depends on A:10.0 and C:30.0 (and thus indirectly A:10.1). Let's also say that C\n+depends on a feature added into 10.1. This means that if 10.0 is selected as the\n+resolved version, then C will fail at runtime. From library D's perspective,\n+this is fine, since Gradle chooses version 10.1.\n+\n+Suppose we add a new library E which uses Maven as its build system, and which\n+adds D as a dependency. When E is built, Maven resolves the whole dependency\n+graph, including D's subgraph, even though Gradle resolved the subgraph of D for\n+itself when D was originally built. When Maven performs its version resolution,\n+it chooses a different version of A (10.0) than Gradle did (10.1), which breaks\n+C.

Here is a visual representation of the process:\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-00.png\">\n+\n+For example, we could have an unresolved graph that looks like this:\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-01.png\">\n+\n+In this graph, there are two versions of A (10.0 and 10.1). The version\n+resolution process picks a single version for A, which could be either version\n+depending on the algorithm. If A:10.0 is picked, the resolved dependency graph\n+looks like the following. In this graph, C's dependency on A:10.1 is overridden.\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-02.png\">\n+\n+If A:10.1 is picked, the resolved dependency graph looks like the following. In\n+this graph, B's dependency on A:10.0 is overridden.\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-03.png\">\n+\n+So why do we need to pick a single version? The reason is that Java's default\n+class loader only loads one version of each fully-qualified class name at\n+runtime. So, if you try to put multiple versions on the classpath, you would not\n+get both versions at runtime. Java build systems handle this issue upfront by\n+picking a single version for each library before the classpath is even\n+constructed.\n+\n+Now let's look at the version resolution algorithms used by Gradle and\n+Maven. Let's consider Gradle first because it is the simpler one to\n+describe. Simply put, Gradle chooses the highest version encountered in your\n+dependency graph. For the example above, Gradle would pick A:10.1.\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-04.png\">\n+\n+Gradle applies the higher-version rule even if it overrides one of your own\n+direct dependency declarations:\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-05.png\">\n+\n+Next let's consider Maven. Maven chooses the version that is closest to the root\n+of the dependency graph, and if there is a tie, then it chooses the version it\n+encounters first. Another way to describe the algorithm is that Maven chooses\n+the first version encountered when traversing the dependency graph following a\n+breadth-first traversal. Looking at the same example we used first for Gradle:\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-06.png\">\n+\n+As you can see if you compare the resolved graphs, Maven makes the opposite\n+choice. Let's look at the second example, where the root has both a direct and\n+indirect dependency on the same library:\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-07.png\">\n+\n+In this case, Maven chooses A:10.0 because it is only 1 hop away from the root\n+instead of 2 hops (A:10.1). In this case, Maven also makes the opposite choice\n+of Gradle.\n+\n+## Interaction between Maven and Gradle\n+\n+Every time a library is built, its build system performs version resolution for\n+its entire dependency graph. Since the libraries in that dependency graph also\n+perform their own version resolution, the versions selected can be different,\n+especially when a consumer uses a different build system than its dependencies.\n+Sometimes, the version selected by the consumer can be incompatible with the\n+version selected by the dependency when the dependency is built by itself.\n+\n+Let's look at an example, starting with Gradle example 2, where library D\n+depends on A:10.0 and C:30.0 (and thus indirectly A:10.1). Let's also say that C\n+depends on a feature added into 10.1. This means that if 10.0 is selected as the\n+resolved version, then C will fail at runtime. From library D's perspective,\n+this is fine, since Gradle chooses version 10.1.\n+\n+Suppose we add a new library E which uses Maven as its build system, and which\n+adds D as a dependency.

Here is a visual representation of the process:\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-00.png\">\n+\n+For example, we could have an unresolved graph that looks like this:\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-01.png\">\n+\n+In this graph, there are two versions of A (10.0 and 10.1). The version\n+resolution process picks a single version for A, which could be either version\n+depending on the algorithm. If A:10.0 is picked, the resolved dependency graph\n+looks like the following. In this graph, C's dependency on A:10.1 is overridden.\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-02.png\">\n+\n+If A:10.1 is picked, the resolved dependency graph looks like the following. In\n+this graph, B's dependency on A:10.0 is overridden.\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-03.png\">\n+\n+So why do we need to pick a single version? The reason is that Java's default\n+class loader only loads one version of each fully-qualified class name at\n+runtime. So, if you try to put multiple versions on the classpath, you would not\n+get both versions at runtime. Java build systems handle this issue upfront by\n+picking a single version for each library before the classpath is even\n+constructed.\n+\n+Now let's look at the version resolution algorithms used by Gradle and\n+Maven. Let's consider Gradle first because it is the simpler one to\n+describe. Simply put, Gradle chooses the highest version encountered in your\n+dependency graph. For the example above, Gradle would pick A:10.1.\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-04.png\">\n+\n+Gradle applies the higher-version rule even if it overrides one of your own\n+direct dependency declarations:\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-05.png\">\n+\n+Next let's consider Maven. Maven chooses the version that is closest to the root\n+of the dependency graph, and if there is a tie, then it chooses the version it\n+encounters first. Another way to describe the algorithm is that Maven chooses\n+the first version encountered when traversing the dependency graph following a\n+breadth-first traversal. Looking at the same example we used first for Gradle:\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-06.png\">\n+\n+As you can see if you compare the resolved graphs, Maven makes the opposite\n+choice. Let's look at the second example, where the root has both a direct and\n+indirect dependency on the same library:\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-07.png\">\n+\n+In this case, Maven chooses A:10.0 because it is only 1 hop away from the root\n+instead of 2 hops (A:10.1). In this case, Maven also makes the opposite choice\n+of Gradle.\n+\n+## Interaction between Maven and Gradle\n+\n+Every time a library is built, its build system performs version resolution for\n+its entire dependency graph. Since the libraries in that dependency graph also\n+perform their own version resolution, the versions selected can be different,\n+especially when a consumer uses a different build system than its dependencies.\n+Sometimes, the version selected by the consumer can be incompatible with the\n+version selected by the dependency when the dependency is built by itself.\n+\n+Let's look at an example, starting with Gradle example 2, where library D\n+depends on A:10.0 and C:30.0 (and thus indirectly A:10.1). Let's also say that C\n+depends on a feature added into 10.1. This means that if 10.0 is selected as the\n+resolved version, then C will fail at runtime. From library D's perspective,\n+this is fine, since Gradle chooses version 10.1.\n+\n+Suppose we add a new library E which uses Maven as its build system, and which\n+adds D as a dependency. When E is built, Maven resolves the whole dependency\n+graph, including D's subgraph, even though Gradle resolved the subgraph of D for\n+itself when D was originally built. When Maven performs its version resolution,\n+it chooses a different version of A (10.0) than Gradle did (10.1), which breaks\n+C. This happens even though D works perfectly fine internally.\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-08.png\">\n+\n+As a consequence, the author of library E might file a bug against library\n+D. The author of library D would argue that there is no bug. From their narrow\n+perspectives they are both right. From the ecosystem perspective, the author of\n+library D unfortunately needs to adapt their dependencies so they don't cause\n+problems for Maven consumers (even though they may have sworn off Maven and use\n+Gradle exclusively). In this case, they have an easy fix - they can upgrade the\n+direct dependency of D on A:10.0 to A:10.1, so that both build systems select\n+the same versions, and everyone can be happy.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4NjM0MzM1NQ=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "c68f34510d608e58bfed850d81aa93bc693e7c09"}, "originalPosition": 114}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMjM5OTAyMjgxOnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "docs/how-does-version-resolution-work-in-maven-and-gradle.md", "isResolved": false, "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMy0wM1QxOTozNzozOVrOFxTw-Q==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMy0wM1QxOTozNzozOVrOFxTw-Q==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4NzI0ODM3Nw==", "bodyText": "Maven", "url": "https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-opensource-java/pull/1259#discussion_r387248377", "createdAt": "2020-03-03T19:37:39Z", "author": {"login": "elharo"}, "path": "docs/how-does-version-resolution-work-in-maven-and-gradle.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,132 @@\n+# How does version resolution work in Maven and Gradle?\n+\n+The build system that you choose for building your Java code determines which\n+version resolution algorithm is used to choose the versions of your\n+dependencies.

Another way to describe the algorithm is that Maven chooses\n+the first version encountered when traversing the dependency graph in\n+breadth-first order. Looking at the same unresolved dependency graph we used\n+in Gradle example 1:\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-06.png\" alt=\"Maven example 1\">\n+\n+As you can see by comparing the resolved graphs, Maven makes the opposite\n+choice.

Since the build systems of the libraries in that\n+dependency graph also perform their own version resolution, the versions\n+selected can be different, especially when a consumer uses a different build\n+system than its dependencies. Sometimes, the version selected by the consumer\n+can be incompatible with the version selected by the dependency when the\n+dependency is built by itself.\n+\n+Consider an example using Gradle example 2 as its basis, where library D depends\n+on A:10.0 and C:30.0 (and thus indirectly A:10.1). Assume C depends on a feature\n+added into 10.1. This means that if 10.0 is selected, C fails at runtime. From\n+library D's perspective, this is fine, since Gradle chooses version 10.1.\n+\n+Suppose a new library E uses Maven as its build system and has a dependency on\n+D. When E is built, Maven resolves the whole dependency graph, including D's\n+subgraph, even though Gradle resolved the subgraph of D for when D was\n+originally built. When Maven performs its version resolution, it chooses a\n+different version of A (10.0) than Gradle did (10.1), which breaks C. This\n+happens even though D works perfectly fine internally.\n+\n+<img src=\"assets/images/ddc-resolution-08.png\" alt=\"Gradle and Maven disagreement\">\n+\n+As a consequence, the author of library E might file a bug against library\n+D. The author of library D would argue that there is no bug. From their individual\n+perspectives, are both right.
