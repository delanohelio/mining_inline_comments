Peer's are now disconnected if they do not respond for a \n+  period ensuring upstream network interruptions are detected and peers can reconnect.\n+- The node's ENR is printed at startup even if the genesis state is not yet known.\n+  As per the beacon chain spec, the network ports are still not opened until the genesis state is known.\n+- OpenAPI schemas are now more compatible with code generating tools.\n+- Include block root in `/beacon/block` responses.\n+- Improved error messages when invalid or incompatible CLI options are provided.\n+- Improved peer discovery by filtering out peers with incompatible `eth2` ENR fields.\n+- Improved performance of BLS signature verification\n+- Updated to jvm-libp2p 0.4.0\n+\n+### Bug Fixes\n+\n+- Fixed a deadlock condition which could cause block imports to silently stall.\n+- Initial sync now reaches chain head correctly even when the chain has not finalized for more than 10 epochs.\n+- Fixed `NullPointerException` and `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException` intermittently encountered when importing blocks \n+  due to a concurrency issue in batch signature verification.\n+- `/beacon/chainhead` reported incorrect slot and block root data.\n+- Fixed a range of race conditions when loading chain data which could result in inconsistent views \n+  of the data or data not being found as it moved from recent to finalized storage.\n+- Significantly reduced the number of ERROR level log messages. \n+  Invalid network data or unexpectedly disconnected peers is now logged at DEBUG level.\n+- Storage system did not correctly prune blocks loaded from disk on startup when they became finalized.\n+\n+\n+### Known Issues\n+\n+- This release provides support for the Witti testnet via `--network witti` however the configuration \n+  for this testnet is not yet stable and will likely differ from the one currently used.\n+- The Schlesi testnet has been abandoned. The `--network schlesi` option will be removed in a future release.\n+- Memory usage grows signficantly during periods of non-finalization.\n+- Teku requires the ETH1 endpoint to keep historic world state available for at least the ETH1 voting period. \n+  This is typically more historic state than is kept when ETH1 nodes are pruning state. \n+  Work around is to connect to an archive node or configure the node to preserve a greater period of historic world state.
