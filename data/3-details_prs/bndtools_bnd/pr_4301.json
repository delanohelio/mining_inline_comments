{"data": {"repository": {"pullRequest": {"id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDgyMDQ0NTgx", "number": 4301, "title": "Refactoring Maven Repository", "bodyText": "The design of the MavenBndRepository is layered. A MavenBndRepository uses an IMavenRepository to access the repositories. This IMavenRepository is constructed from a local repository (.m2) and a set of backing repositories. The purpose of the backing repositories is to abstract the source. Either a file repository or remote repository.\nFor unknown reasons, the backing repositories implemented the metadata handling, making them unnecessarily complex. This wasn't a big deal because the implementations inherited from a base class.\nHowever, trying to properly handle the caching problems of snapshots, it became too hairy. Although this looks like an easy problem, it interacts with the metadata caching & archive stale time & HTTP client caching in mysterious ways. I.e. too much caching was going on.\nI, therefore, moved the metadata methods to the MavenRepository implementation, actually simplifying things considerably. All caching is now in the MavenRepository class. I also moved some of the validation methods to the MavenRepository as well, simplifying the callers. I also unrolled the promises in the MavenRemoteRepository fetch method. This is a private method and was called locally once where there was a wait on the promise. The use of promises made it impossible to single step and verify while using more threads. So this has now become a simple method instead of promise acrobatics.\nIn the end the cache handling of snapshots is now a lot clearer.\nA MavenBndRepository reads the index and then fetches all files at startup or when there is an addition. Since the init must be done before the first use of the repository, it can assume there is a file present. I.e. the MavenBndRepository 'get' method never fetched content, the content was already there.\nWhen the MavenBndRepository get method is called, it will 'find' the archive in the index. The archive is now checked to be stale via the IMavenRepo. The time for snapshots is an hour and a release a week. (We could make it infinite.) If the file is stale, an update is scheduled.\nWhen the refresh is called it clears the metadata cache map and starts an update of all current snapshot archives.\nFor each updated archive, it is read from the IMavenRepo.\nOptimizations in the IndexFile have been removed.\nIf the archive is a snapshot, it is first necessary to read the Revision Metadata to find the remote path since each snapshot release creates a new path. A refresh will remove this metadata, which forces a read for snapshots. Releases cannot be refreshed.\nThe MavenRemoteRepository will use the rewritten fetch method to get this file from the Http Client. This used\nto another stale time during which there was no check of the remote status. This has been changed. The fetch method will now always check the remote. However, it will use the etag to check if there was a refresh so no download will actually take place if the file is still the same.\nThis results in either an updated or unmodified file. In both cases, we parse the file and create a new  RevisionMetadata.\nThe snapshot is then resolved against the new metadata.\nThis results in a potentially new remote path. We'll use the fetch method to get this file and then parse it.\nThis change will result that snapshots can be refreshed. However, snapshots are also fetched at startup now.", "createdAt": "2020-09-08T13:29:53Z", "url": "https://github.com/bndtools/bnd/pull/4301", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "9c9a0ffa01c15ed0230392d2bf41381a2b1bf6cf"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-09-15T13:40:43Z", "author": {"login": "pkriens"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 5, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABdG5JzwgFqTQ4NDIzNzQ5OA==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABdHJGaHgBqjM3NDQ5ODUzNDg=", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDg0MjM3NDk4", "url": "https://github.com/bndtools/bnd/pull/4301#pullrequestreview-484237498", "createdAt": "2020-09-08T15:06:48Z", "commit": {"oid": "67e15d05e1e4be5c495fa898bfe70e43954a77e7"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 3, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wOS0wOFQxNTowNjo0OFrOHOhvcA==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wOS0wOFQxNToxNTowMFrOHOiFDw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4NDk5NDkyOA==", "bodyText": "Since you use onResolve, serializer is the same as result which means the refresh action will not happen before sync(serializer) returns.
