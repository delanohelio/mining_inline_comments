In order for the FHIR server to trust your browser and return data, the client certificate at `apps/bfd-server/dev/ssl-stores/client-trusted-keystore.pfx` needs to be imported into the browser. The cert password is 'changeit'. \n-\n-In Chrome this can be done at `chrome://settings/certificates`. In Firefox it can be done at `about:preferences#privacy`, there is a button at the bottom called \"View Certificates\" that should give the option to import one. \n-Note MacOS Users: To make this cert available to Chrome or Firefox you'll need to add this cert to the Keychain application. \n-\n-### Loading data to work with\n+Then checkout a new branch to work on (the `-b` tells it to make a new branch).\n \n-First you'll want some synthetic data to load and work with. To fetch the synthetic data from a public S3 bucket:\n ```\n-make synthetic-data/*.rif\n+git checkout -b <your username>/<your feature name>\n+# If you ever have to rename this branch you can do so with\n+# git branch -m <your username>/<your feature name> <your username>/<your new name>\n ```\n+### Setting Up A Local Development Environment On Windows\n \n-Tip: This will download to a folder within the contributing folder within the repo. Consider moving this synthetic data outside the repo and updating your .env file to point to this new location. It will save you some steps in the future. \n-\n-To load some data for the BFD to return first apply the patches that allow the system to load local data: \n-\n-Caution: Since this changes the code in the repository please keep in mind not to commit these changes and to be aware of them while making your own changes.
