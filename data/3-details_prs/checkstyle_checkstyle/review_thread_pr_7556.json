Too many commands in 1 file will make it become huge and possibly more problematic to maintain. CIs may change but the job the script is doing usually won't. What about splitting them by a type? We could have 1 script that contains everything regression related, etc... This is similar to the pitest script. Maybe any misc jobs that don't fit a type could be put into a plain run script.", "url": "https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/7556#discussion_r381053725", "createdAt": "2020-02-19T03:01:05Z", "author": {"login": "rnveach"}, "path": "wercker.yml", "diffHunk": "@@ -193,6 +193,16 @@ build:\n           echo \"build is skipped ...\"\n         fi\n \n+  - script:", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4MTA1MDE5Mg=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "6413ca7090a08ff5d03d462f0fabd55c46c313fe"}, "originalPosition": 4}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4MTA4MTgxNw==", "bodyText": "What about splitting them by a type?\n\nThis is exactly what I meant, but looks like lost in writing", "url": "https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/7556#discussion_r381081817", "createdAt": "2020-02-19T05:17:52Z", "author": {"login": "romani"}, "path": "wercker.yml", "diffHunk": "@@ -193,6 +193,16 @@ build:\n           echo \"build is skipped ...\"\n         fi\n \n+  - script:", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4MTA1MDE5Mg=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "6413ca7090a08ff5d03d462f0fabd55c46c313fe"}, "originalPosition": 4}]}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 1323, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-12T18:49:56Z"}}}
