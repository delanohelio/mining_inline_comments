You can enable TLS to secure external client connections to Druid as well as connections between cluster nodes. \n+\n+The configuration steps are: \n+\n+1. Enable TLS by adding `druid.enableTlsPort=true` to `common.runtime.properties` on each node in the Druid cluster.\n+2. Follow the steps in [Understanding Certificates and Keys](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/current/configuring-ssl.html#understanding-certificates-and-keys) to generate or import a key and certificate. \n+3. Configure the keystore and truststore settings in `common.runtime.properties`. The file should look something like this: \n+  ```\n+  druid.enablePlaintextPort=false\n+  druid.enableTlsPort=true\n+  \n+  druid.server.https.keyStoreType=jks\n+  druid.server.https.keyStorePath=imply-keystore.jks\n+  druid.server.https.keyStorePassword=secret123 # replace with your own password\n+  druid.server.https.certAlias=druid \n+  \n+  druid.client.https.protocol=TLSv1.2\n+  druid.client.https.trustStoreType=jks\n+  druid.client.https.trustStorePath=imply-truststore.jks\n+  druid.client.https.trustStorePassword=secret123  # replace with your own password\n+\n+  ``` \n+4. Add the `simple-client-sslcontext` extension to `druid.extensions.loadList` in common.runtime.properties. This enables TLS for Druid nodes acting as clients.\n+5. Restart the cluster.\n+\n+For more information, see [TLS support](tls-support) and [Simple SSLContext Provider Module](../development/extensions-core/simple-client-sslcontext). \n+\n+Druid uses Jetty as its embedded web server. Therefore you refer to [Understanding Certificates and Keys](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/current/configuring-ssl.html) for complete instructions. \n+\n+\n+## Enable an authenticator\n+\n+To authenticate requests in Druid, you configure an Authenticator. Authenticator extensions exist for HTTP basic authentication, LDAP, and Kerberos.  \n+\n+The following takes you through sample configuration steps for enabling basic auth:  \n+\n+1. Add the `basic-auth` extension to `druid.extensions.loadList` in common.runtime.properties.

For example: \n+\t```\n+\tcurl -u admin:password -XPOST https://my-coordinator-ip:8281/druid-ext/basic-security/authorization/db/basic/users/myname\n+\t```\n+3. Create authorizer roles to control permissions by issuing a POST request to `druid-ext/basic-security/authorization/db/MyBasicMetadataAuthorizer/roles/<ROLENAME>`. For example: \n+\t```\n+   curl -u admin:password -XPOST https://my-coordinator-ip:8281/druid-ext/basic-security/authorization/db/basic/roles/myrole\n+   ```\n+4. Assign roles to users by issuing a POST request to `druid-ext/basic-security/authorization/db/MyBasicMetadataAuthorizer/users/<USERNAME>/roles/<ROLENAME>`. For example: \n+\t```\n+\tcurl -u admin:password -XPOST https://my-coordinator-ip:8281/druid-ext/basic-security/authorization/db/basic/users/myname/roles/myrole | jq\n+\t```\n+5. Finally, attach permissions to the roles to control how they can interact with Druid at `druid-ext/basic-security/authorization/db/MyBasicMetadataAuthorizer/roles/<ROLENAME>/permissions`. \n+\tFor example: \n+\t```\n+\tcurl -u admin:password -H'Content-Type: application/json' -XPOST --data-binary @perms.json https://my-coordinator-ip:8281/druid-ext/basic-security/authorization/db/basic/roles/myrole/permissions\n+\t```\n+\tThe payload of perms.json should be in the form:\n+   \t```\n+    [\n+    {\n+      \"resource\": {\n+        \"name\": \"<PATTERN>\",\n+        \"type\": \"DATASOURCE\"\n+      },\n+      \"action\": \"READ\"\n+    },\n+    {\n+      \"resource\": {\n+      \"name\": \"STATE\",\n+      \"type\": \"STATE\"\n+    },\n+    \"action\": \"READ\"\n+    }\n+    ]\n+    ```\n+\n+\n+## Configuring an LDAP authorizor", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "9049b057a5c6e4d5a93ebd570feb536e31b1bd74"}, "originalPosition": 170}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5OTk2MTA5MQ==", "bodyText": "Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n            As an alternative to using the basic metadata authenticator, as shown in the previous section, you can use LDAP to authorize users.

Access to the console effectively confers access the file system on the installation machine, via file browsers in the UI. You should use an API gateway that restricts who can connect from untrusted networks, whitelists the specific APIs that your users need to access, and implements account lockout and throttling features.\n+* Grant users the minimum permissions necessary to perform their functions. For instance, do not allow user who only need to query data to write to data sources or view state.  \n+* Disable JavaScript, as noted in the [Security section](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/development/javascript.html#security) of the JavaScript guide.\n+* Run Druid as an unprivileged Unix user on the installation machine (not root).\n+   > This is an important point! Administrator users on Druid have the same permission as the Unix user account it is running under. If the Druid process is running under the root user account in the OS, then Administrator users on Druid can read/write all files that the root account has access to, including sensitive files such as /etc/passwd.\n+\n+You can configure authentication and authorization to control access to the the Druid APIs. The first step is enabling TLS for the cluster nodes. Then configure users, roles, and permissions, as described in the following sections. \n+\n+The configuration settings mentioned below are primarily located in the `common.runtime.properties` file. Note that you need to make the configuration changes on each Druid server in the cluster. \n+\n+\n+## Enable TLS\n+\n+The first step in securing Druid is enabling TLS. You can enable TLS to secure external client connections to Druid as well as connections between cluster nodes. \n+\n+The configuration steps are: \n+\n+1. Enable TLS by adding `druid.enableTlsPort=true` to `common.runtime.properties` on each node in the Druid cluster.\n+2. Follow the steps in [Understanding Certificates and Keys](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/current/configuring-ssl.html#understanding-certificates-and-keys) to generate or import a key and certificate. \n+3. Configure the keystore and truststore settings in `common.runtime.properties`. The file should look something like this: \n+  ```\n+  druid.enablePlaintextPort=false\n+  druid.enableTlsPort=true\n+  \n+  druid.server.https.keyStoreType=jks\n+  druid.server.https.keyStorePath=imply-keystore.jks\n+  druid.server.https.keyStorePassword=secret123 # replace with your own password\n+  druid.server.https.certAlias=druid \n+  \n+  druid.client.https.protocol=TLSv1.2\n+  druid.client.https.trustStoreType=jks\n+  druid.client.https.trustStorePath=imply-truststore.jks\n+  druid.client.https.trustStorePassword=secret123  # replace with your own password\n+\n+  ``` \n+4. Add the `simple-client-sslcontext` extension to `druid.extensions.loadList` in common.runtime.properties. This enables TLS for Druid nodes acting as clients.\n+5. Restart the cluster.\n+\n+For more information, see [TLS support](tls-support) and [Simple SSLContext Provider Module](../development/extensions-core/simple-client-sslcontext). \n+\n+Druid uses Jetty as its embedded web server. Therefore you refer to [Understanding Certificates and Keys](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/current/configuring-ssl.html) for complete instructions. \n+\n+\n+## Enable an authenticator\n+\n+To authenticate requests in Druid, you configure an Authenticator. Authenticator extensions exist for HTTP basic authentication, LDAP, and Kerberos.  \n+\n+The following takes you through sample configuration steps for enabling basic auth:  \n+\n+1. Add the `basic-auth` extension to `druid.extensions.loadList` in common.runtime.properties. For the quickstart installation, for example, the properties file is at `conf/druid/cluster/_common`:\n+   ```\n+   druid.extensions.loadList=[\"druid-basic-security\", \"druid-histogram\", \"druid-datasketches\", \"druid-kafka-indexing-service\", \"imply-utility-belt\"]\n+   ```\n+2. Configure the basic Authenticator, Authorizer, and Escalator settings in the same common.runtime.properties file. For example:\n+   ```\n+   # Druid basic security\n+   druid.auth.authenticatorChain=[\"MyBasicMetadataAuthenticator\"]\n+\n+   druid.auth.authenticator.MyBasicMetadataAuthenticator.type=basic\n+   druid.auth.authenticator.MyBasicMetadataAuthenticator.initialAdminPassword=password1\n+   druid.auth.authenticator.MyBasicMetadataAuthenticator.initialInternalClientPassword=password2\n+   druid.auth.authenticator.MyBasicMetadataAuthenticator.credentialsValidator.type=metadata\n+   druid.auth.authenticator.MyBasicMetadataAuthenticator.skipOnFailure=false\n+   druid.auth.authenticator.MyBasicMetadataAuthenticator.authorizerName=MyBasicMetadataAuthorizer\n+\n+   # Escalator\n+   druid.escalator.type=basic\n+   druid.escalator.internalClientUsername=druid_system\n+   druid.escalator.internalClientPassword=password2\n+   druid.escalator.authorizerName=MyBasicMetadataAuthorizer\n+\n+   druid.auth.authorizers=[\"MyBasicMetadataAuthorizer\"]\n+\n+   druid.auth.authorizer.MyBasicMetadataAuthorizer.type=basic\n+   ```\n+\n+3. Restart the cluster. \n+\n+See [Basic Security](../development/extensions-core/druid-basic-security) for more information. For more on authentication extensions, see [Kerberos](../development/extensions-core/druid-kerberos), [Authentication and Authorization](../design/auth), and [Authentication and Authorization](../design/auth) \n+\n+\n+## Enable authorizors\n+\n+After enabling the basic auth extension, you can add users, roles, and permissions via the Druid Coordinator `user` endpoint. Note that you cannot assign permissions directly to individual users. They must be assigned through roles. \n+\n+The following diagram depicts the authorization model, and the relationship between users, roles, permissions, and resources.\n+ \n+![Druid Security model](../assets/security-model-2.png \"Druid security model\") \n+\n+\n+The following steps walk through a sample setup procedure:  \n+\n+> The Coordinator API port is 8081 for non-TLS connections and 8281 for secured connections.\n+\n+1. Create a user by issuing a POST request to `druid-ext/basic-security/authentication/db/MyBasicMetadataAuthenticator/users/<USERNAME>`, replacing USERNAME with the new username. For example: \n+  ```\n+   curl -u admin:password -XPOST https://my-coordinator-ip:8281/druid-ext/basic-security/authentication/db/basic/users/myname\n+  ```\n+2. Add a credential for the user by issuing a POST to `druid-ext/basic-security/authentication/db/MyBasicMetadataAuthenticator/users/<USERNAME>/credentials`. For example:\n+    ```\n+    curl -u admin:password -H'Content-Type: application/json' -XPOST --data-binary @pass.json https://my-coordinator-ip:8281/druid-ext/basic-security/authentication/db/basic/users/myname/credentials\n+    ```\n+    The password is conveyed in the pass.json file, the payload of which should be in the form:\n+   \t```\n+   \t{\n+      \"password\": \"password\"\n+    }\n+    ```\n+2. For each authenticator user you create, create a corresponding authorizer user by issuing a POST request to `druid-ext/basic-security/authorization/db/MyBasicMetadataAuthorizer/users/<USERNAME>`. For example: \n+\t```\n+\tcurl -u admin:password -XPOST https://my-coordinator-ip:8281/druid-ext/basic-security/authorization/db/basic/users/myname\n+\t```\n+3. Create authorizer roles to control permissions by issuing a POST request to `druid-ext/basic-security/authorization/db/MyBasicMetadataAuthorizer/roles/<ROLENAME>`. For example: \n+\t```\n+   curl -u admin:password -XPOST https://my-coordinator-ip:8281/druid-ext/basic-security/authorization/db/basic/roles/myrole\n+   ```\n+4. Assign roles to users by issuing a POST request to `druid-ext/basic-security/authorization/db/MyBasicMetadataAuthorizer/users/<USERNAME>/roles/<ROLENAME>`. For example: \n+\t```\n+\tcurl -u admin:password -XPOST https://my-coordinator-ip:8281/druid-ext/basic-security/authorization/db/basic/users/myname/roles/myrole | jq\n+\t```\n+5. Finally, attach permissions to the roles to control how they can interact with Druid at `druid-ext/basic-security/authorization/db/MyBasicMetadataAuthorizer/roles/<ROLENAME>/permissions`. \n+\tFor example: \n+\t```\n+\tcurl -u admin:password -H'Content-Type: application/json' -XPOST --data-binary @perms.json https://my-coordinator-ip:8281/druid-ext/basic-security/authorization/db/basic/roles/myrole/permissions\n+\t```\n+\tThe payload of perms.json should be in the form:\n+   \t```\n+    [\n+    {\n+      \"resource\": {\n+        \"name\": \"<PATTERN>\",\n+        \"type\": \"DATASOURCE\"\n+      },\n+      \"action\": \"READ\"\n+    },\n+    {\n+      \"resource\": {\n+      \"name\": \"STATE\",\n+      \"type\": \"STATE\"\n+    },\n+    \"action\": \"READ\"\n+    }\n+    ]\n+    ```\n+\n+\n+## Configuring an LDAP authorizor\n+\n+As an alternative to using the basic metadata authenticator, as shown in the previous section, you can use LDAP to authorize users. The following steps provide an overview of the setup steps.

If the Druid process is running under the root user account in the OS, then Administrator users on Druid can read/write all files that the root account has access to, including sensitive files such as /etc/passwd.\n+\n+You can configure authentication and authorization to control access to the the Druid APIs. The first step is enabling TLS for the cluster nodes. Then configure users, roles, and permissions, as described in the following sections. \n+\n+The configuration settings mentioned below are primarily located in the `common.runtime.properties` file. Note that you need to make the configuration changes on each Druid server in the cluster. \n+\n+\n+## Enable TLS\n+\n+The first step in securing Druid is enabling TLS. You can enable TLS to secure external client connections to Druid as well as connections between cluster nodes. \n+\n+The configuration steps are: \n+\n+1. Enable TLS by adding `druid.enableTlsPort=true` to `common.runtime.properties` on each node in the Druid cluster.\n+2. Follow the steps in [Understanding Certificates and Keys](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/current/configuring-ssl.html#understanding-certificates-and-keys) to generate or import a key and certificate. \n+3. Configure the keystore and truststore settings in `common.runtime.properties`. The file should look something like this: \n+  ```\n+  druid.enablePlaintextPort=false\n+  druid.enableTlsPort=true\n+  \n+  druid.server.https.keyStoreType=jks\n+  druid.server.https.keyStorePath=imply-keystore.jks\n+  druid.server.https.keyStorePassword=secret123 # replace with your own password\n+  druid.server.https.certAlias=druid \n+  \n+  druid.client.https.protocol=TLSv1.2\n+  druid.client.https.trustStoreType=jks\n+  druid.client.https.trustStorePath=imply-truststore.jks\n+  druid.client.https.trustStorePassword=secret123  # replace with your own password\n+\n+  ``` \n+4. Add the `simple-client-sslcontext` extension to `druid.extensions.loadList` in common.runtime.properties. This enables TLS for Druid nodes acting as clients.\n+5. Restart the cluster.\n+\n+For more information, see [TLS support](tls-support) and [Simple SSLContext Provider Module](../development/extensions-core/simple-client-sslcontext).
