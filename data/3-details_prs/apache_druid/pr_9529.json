A note like this would have helped point me in the right direction.\n\nThis PR has:\n\n added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.", "createdAt": "2020-03-17T18:08:24Z", "url": "https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/9529", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "0ac875a8b4d0b101199be15cf2c19b1031a40b04"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-03-24T10:33:30Z", "author": {"login": "nvolungis"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 5, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABcOmnTwgH2gAyMzg5OTk1MjU2OjI1MTVjZDZkZTU4ZjJkZjg4MGI1OTgxNDM1YzAyNjcwODNkOTBkMWM=", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABcQwZi8gFqTM4MDE4MDA4Nw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "2515cd6de58f2df880b5981435c0267083d90d1c", "author": {"user": {"login": "nvolungis", "name": "Neil Volungis"}}, "url": "https://github.com/apache/druid/commit/2515cd6de58f2df880b5981435c0267083d90d1c", "committedDate": "2020-03-17T18:00:21Z", "message": "Update docker.md readme to note memory requirements"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Mzc2MzM2ODE4", "url": "https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/9529#pullrequestreview-376336818", "createdAt": "2020-03-17T19:22:35Z", "commit": {"oid": "2515cd6de58f2df880b5981435c0267083d90d1c"}, "state": "APPROVED", "comments": {"totalCount": 0, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": null, "endCursor": null, "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": []}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Mzc2NDMwNjg2", "url": "https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/9529#pullrequestreview-376430686", "createdAt": "2020-03-17T21:50:41Z", "commit": {"oid": "2515cd6de58f2df880b5981435c0267083d90d1c"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMy0xN1QyMTo1MDo0MlrOF3vUfw==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMy0xN1QyMTo1MDo0MlrOF3vUfw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5Mzk5MTI5NQ==", "bodyText": "This should fix the failing spellcheck test\n\n  \n    \n      \n        Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n            If you experience any processes crashing with a 137 error code you likely don't have enough memory allocated to Docker. 6gb may be a good place to start. \n          \n          \n            \n            If you experience any processes crashing with a 137 error code you likely don't have enough memory allocated to Docker. 6 GB may be a good place to start.", "url": "https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/9529#discussion_r393991295", "createdAt": "2020-03-17T21:50:42Z", "author": {"login": "suneet-s"}, "path": "docs/tutorials/docker.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -78,3 +78,6 @@ The [Druid router process](../design/router.md), which serves the [Druid console\n It takes a few seconds for all the Druid processes to fully start up.
