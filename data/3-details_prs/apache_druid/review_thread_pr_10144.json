It is serialized in an HTTP header with a maximum length of 7KB. This error occurs when an intermediate response context sent from a data server (like a Historical) to the Broker exceeds this limit.The response context is used for a variety of purposes, but the one most likely to generate a large context is sharing details about segments that move during a query. That means this error can potentially indicate that a very large number of segments moved in between the time a Broker issued a query and the time it was processed on Historicals.
