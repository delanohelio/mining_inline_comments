The cluster operators would have the goal of having 100% of jobs successfully handoff data before the timeout, but when that doesn't happen our users simply want to know that they may need to wait longer. We are simply trying to be transparent and report the point in time status. The onus of finding out when the data is fully loaded if this timeout expired before loading, would fall on a different solution (TBD).\nYou're right, we intentionally did not fail these tasks because Historical nodes loading the segments is detached from whether or not the data was written to deepstore/metastore (if that failed the task should and likely would fail due to existing code paths). We don't want our end users thinking they need to re-run their jobs when this is much more likely to be an issue of the coordinator not having assigned servers to load segments by the time the timeout expired.\nWhy the handoff failed would be something I as an operator am more interested compared to a user (unless that user is also an operator). I think that would be very difficult to communicate in these reports since the indexing task doesn't know much about what the rest of the cluster is doing.\nKnowing how long it took before the time out could be found in the spec, but I guess it could be useful to add that value to the report as well if you think users would want to have quick reference. I think that rather than having that static value, it could be cool to have the dynamic time waited for handoff.

The callback function required for the appenderator is incompatible with batch ingestion as it stands today.

I think there are some things we should think about first.\n\nIt's true that currently compaction doesn't change the underlying data much, but it can make some changes such as filtering out some unnecessary dimensions or adding new metrics. You can also change the query granularity now. In the future, I can imagine that you can even transform your data using compaction with a new support for transformSpec.\nThe compaction task is a bit special and different from other batch tasks in how it publishes segments. All other batch tasks can push segments in the middle of indexing, but should publish all those segments at the end of indexing. However, the compaction task can process each time chunk at a time when there is no change in segment granularity. In this case, it can publish segments whenever it finishes processing individual time chunk. It can also go through all time chunks even when there are some time chunks that it fails to compact. The final task status will be FAILED when it succeeds to compact only some time chunks but fails for others.\nCompacting datasources is usually not the single-shot type job. Rather, you would run multiple small compaction tasks over time as in auto compaction. In that case, you would want to know what time chunks are compacted and what are not, so that you can determine what result you can get when you query certain time chunks. For the compaction that is manually set up outside druid, tracking of individual compaction tasks could be useful for this purpose. However, for auto compaction, it won't provide much value since compaction tasks are submitted by the coordinator not users. So, we need another way such as adding a new coordinator API that returns such compaction status.\n\nFrom these, we would probably want something similar but different for compaction from the one proposed here.

With the changes in this PR, each of those parallel indexing tasks will wait for segment handoff independently. The handoff wait timeout will also apply separately for each parallel task. I think this is OK as long as it's documented, but what I meant is, maybe we could do this differently, such as waiting for segments to be handed off all together after running all parallel tasks.\n\nShould not allow the handoff to occur when it is a compact type task?
