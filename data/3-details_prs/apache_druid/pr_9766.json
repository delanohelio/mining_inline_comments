Logs for the services are located at `var/sv`.\n+All persistent state, such as the cluster metadata store and segments for the services, are kept in the `var` directory under \n+the Druid root directory, apache-druid-{{DRUIDVERSION}}. Each service writes to a log file under `var/sv`, as noted in the startup script output above.\n+\n+At any time, you can revert Druid to its original, post-installation state by deleting the entire `var` directory. You may\n+want to do this, for example, between Druid tutorials or after experimentation, to start with a fresh instance. \n+\n+To stop Druid at any time, use CTRL-C in the terminal. This exits the `bin/start-micro-quickstart` script and \n+terminates all Druid processes. \n+\n \n-Later on, if you'd like to stop the services, CTRL-C to exit the `bin/start-micro-quickstart` script, which will terminate the Druid processes.\n+## Step 3.

If you open the console immediately after starting the services, you may see some errors that you can safely ignore.\n-\n-\n-## Loading data\n-\n-### Tutorial dataset\n-\n-For the following data loading tutorials, we have included a sample data file containing Wikipedia page edit events that occurred on 2015-09-12.\n-\n-This sample data is located at `quickstart/tutorial/wikiticker-2015-09-12-sampled.json.gz` from the Druid package root.\n-The page edit events are stored as JSON objects in a text file.\n-\n-The sample data has the following columns, and an example event is shown below:\n-\n-  * added\n-  * channel\n-  * cityName\n-  * comment\n-  * countryIsoCode\n-  * countryName\n-  * deleted\n-  * delta\n-  * isAnonymous\n-  * isMinor\n-  * isNew\n-  * isRobot\n-  * isUnpatrolled\n-  * metroCode\n-  * namespace\n-  * page\n-  * regionIsoCode\n-  * regionName\n-  * user\n-\n-```json\n-{\n-  \"timestamp\":\"2015-09-12T20:03:45.018Z\",\n-  \"channel\":\"#en.wikipedia\",\n-  \"namespace\":\"Main\",\n-  \"page\":\"Spider-Man's powers and equipment\",\n-  \"user\":\"foobar\",\n-  \"comment\":\"/* Artificial web-shooters */\",\n-  \"cityName\":\"New York\",\n-  \"regionName\":\"New York\",\n-  \"regionIsoCode\":\"NY\",\n-  \"countryName\":\"United States\",\n-  \"countryIsoCode\":\"US\",\n-  \"isAnonymous\":false,\n-  \"isNew\":false,\n-  \"isMinor\":false,\n-  \"isRobot\":false,\n-  \"isUnpatrolled\":false,\n-  \"added\":99,\n-  \"delta\":99,\n-  \"deleted\":0,\n-}\n-```\n+It may take a few seconds for all Druid services to finish starting, including the [Druid router](../design/router.md), which serves the console. If you attempt to open the Druid console before startup is complete, you may see errors in the browser. Wait a few moments and try again. \n \n \n-### Data loading tutorials\n+## Step 4. Load data\n \n-The following tutorials demonstrate various methods of loading data into Druid, including both batch and streaming use cases.\n-All tutorials assume that you are using the `micro-quickstart` single-machine configuration mentioned above.\n \n-- [Loading a file](./tutorial-batch.md) - this tutorial demonstrates how to perform a batch file load, using Druid's native batch ingestion.\n-- [Loading stream data from Apache Kafka](./tutorial-kafka.md) - this tutorial demonstrates how to load streaming data from a Kafka topic.\n-- [Loading a file using Apache Hadoop](./tutorial-batch-hadoop.md) - this tutorial demonstrates how to perform a batch file load, using a remote Hadoop cluster.\n-- [Writing your own ingestion spec](./tutorial-ingestion-spec.md) - this tutorial demonstrates how to write a new ingestion spec and use it to load data.\n+Ingestion specs define the schema of the data Druid reads and stores. You can write ingestion specs by hand or using the _data loader_, \n+as we will do here. \n \n-### Resetting cluster state\n+For this tutorial, we'll load sample data bundled with Druid that represents Wikipedia page edits on a given day.

Click **Next: Transform**, **Next: Filter**, and then **Next: Configure schema**, skipping a few steps.\n+\n+   You do not need to adjust transformation or filtering settings, as applying ingestion time transforms and \n+   filters are out of scope for this tutorial.\n+\n+8. The Configure schema settings are where you configure what [dimensions](../ingestion/index.md#dimensions) \n+   and [metrics](../ingestion/index.md#metrics) are ingested. The outcome of this configuration represents exactly how the \n+   data will appear in Druid after ingestion. \n+\n+   Since our dataset is very small, you can turn off [rollup](../ingestion/index.md#rollup) \n+   by unsetting the **Rollup** switch and confirming the change when prompted.\n+\n+   ![Data loader schema](../assets/tutorial-batch-data-loader-05.png \"Data loader schema\")\n+\n+\n+10. Click **Next: Partition** to configure how the data will be split into segments. In this case, choose `DAY` as \n+    the **Segment Granularity**. \n+\n+    ![Data loader partition](../assets/tutorial-batch-data-loader-06.png \"Data loader partition\")\n+\n+    Since this is a small dataset, we can have just a single segment, which is what selecting `DAY` as the \n+    segment granularity gives us. \n+\n+11. Click **Next: Tune** and **Next: Publish**.\n+\n+12. The Publish settings are where you can specify the datasource name in Druid.
