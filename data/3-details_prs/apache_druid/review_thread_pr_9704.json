Stacking joins on top of each other allows\n+you to join arbitrarily many datasources.\n+\n+In Druid {{DRUIDVERSION}}, joins are implemented with a broadcast hash-join algorithm. This means that all tables\n+other than the leftmost \"base\" table must fit in memory. It also means that the join condition must be an equality. This\n+feature is intended mainly to allow joining regular Druid tables with [lookup](#lookup), [inline](#inline), and\n+[query](#query) datasources.\n+\n+For information about how Druid executes queries involving joins, refer to the\n+[Query execution](query-execution.html#join) page.\n+\n+#### Joins in SQL\n+\n+SQL joins take the form:\n+\n+```\n+<o1> [ INNER | LEFT [OUTER] ] JOIN <o2> ON <condition>\n+```\n+\n+The condition must involve only equalities, but functions are okay, and there can be multiple equalities ANDed together.\n+Conditions like `t1.x = t2.x`, or `LOWER(t1.x) = t2.x`, or `t1.x = t2.x AND t1.y = t2.y` can all be handled. Conditions\n+like `t1.x <> t2.x` cannot currently be handled.\n \n-### Union datasource\n+Note that Druid SQL is less rigid than what native join datasources can handle. In cases where a SQL query does\n+something that is not allowed as-is with a native join datasource, Druid SQL will generate a subquery. This can have\n+a substantial effect on performance and scalability, so it is something to watch out for. Some examples of when the\n+SQL layer will generate subqueries include:\n \n-This data source unions two or more table data sources.\n+- Joining a regular Druid table to itself, or to another regular Druid table. The native join datasource can accept\n+a table on the left-hand side, but not the right, so a subquery is needed.\n \n+- Join conditions where the expressions on either side are of different types.\n+\n+- Join conditions where the right-hand expression is not a direct column access.\n+\n+For more information about how Druid translates SQL to native queries, refer to the\n+[Druid SQL](sql.md#query-translation) documentation.\n+\n+#### Joins in native queries\n+\n+Native join datasources have the following properties. All are required.\n+\n+|Field|Description|\n+|-----|-----------|\n+|`left`|Left-hand datasource. Must be of type `table`, `join`, `lookup`, `query`, or `inline`.

In cases where a SQL query does\n+something that is not allowed as-is with a native join datasource, Druid SQL will generate a subquery. This can have\n+a substantial effect on performance and scalability, so it is something to watch out for. Some examples of when the\n+SQL layer will generate subqueries include:\n \n-This data source unions two or more table data sources.\n+- Joining a regular Druid table to itself, or to another regular Druid table. The native join datasource can accept\n+a table on the left-hand side, but not the right, so a subquery is needed.\n \n+- Join conditions where the expressions on either side are of different types.\n+\n+- Join conditions where the right-hand expression is not a direct column access.\n+\n+For more information about how Druid translates SQL to native queries, refer to the\n+[Druid SQL](sql.md#query-translation) documentation.\n+\n+#### Joins in native queries\n+\n+Native join datasources have the following properties. All are required.\n+\n+|Field|Description|\n+|-----|-----------|\n+|`left`|Left-hand datasource. Must be of type `table`, `join`, `lookup`, `query`, or `inline`. Placing another join as the left datasource allows you to join arbitrarily many datasources.|\n+|`right`|Right-hand datasource. Must be of type `lookup`, `query`, or `inline`. Note that this is more rigid than what Druid SQL requires.|\n+|`rightPrefix`|String prefix that will be applied to all columns from the right-hand datasource, to prevent them from colliding with columns from the left-hand datasource. Can be any string, so long as it is nonempty and is not be a prefix of the string `__time`. Any columns from the left-hand side that start with your `rightPrefix` will be shadowed. It is up to you to provide a prefix that will not shadow any important columns from the left side.|\n+|`condition`|[Expression](../misc/math-expr.md) that must be an equality where one side is an expression of the left-hand side, and the other side is a simple column reference to the right-hand side. Note that this is more rigid than what Druid SQL requires: here, the right-hand reference must be a simple column reference; in SQL it can be an expression.|\n+|`joinType`|`INNER` or `LEFT`.|\n+\n+#### Join performance\n+\n+Joins are a feature that can significantly affect performance of your queries. Some performance tips and notes:\n+\n+1. Joins are especially useful with [lookup datasources](#lookup), but in most cases, the\n+[`LOOKUP` function](sql.html#string-functions) performs better than a join. Consider using the `LOOKUP` function if\n+it is appropriate for your use case.\n+2. When using joins in Druid SQL, keep in mind that it can generate subqueries that you did not explicitly include in\n+your queries. Refer to the [Druid SQL](sql.md#query-translation) documentation for more details about when this happens\n+and how to detect it.\n+3. One common reason for implicit subquery generation is if the types of the two halves of an equality do not match.\n+For example, since lookup keys are always strings, the condition `druid.d JOIN lookup.l ON d.field = l.field` will\n+perform best if `d.field` is a string.\n+4. As of Druid {{DRUIDVERSION}}, the join operator must evaluate the condition for each row. In the future, we expect\n+to implement both early and deferred condition evaluation, which we expect to improve performance considerably for\n+common use cases.\n+\n+#### Future work for joins\n+\n+Joins are an area of active development in Druid. The following features are missing today but may appear in\n+future versions:\n+\n+- Preloaded dimension tables that are wider than lookups (i.e. supporting more than a single key and single value).\n+- RIGHT OUTER and FULL OUTER joins. Currently, they are partially implemented. Queries will run but results will not\n+always be correct.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "e5de6353fc4dbfacb21b661c79137a1001f4a667"}, "originalPosition": 267}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMjUzODk5NjM2OnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "docs/querying/datasource.md", "isResolved": false, "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNC0xNVQxNTo1NjoyOFrOGGAimA==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNC0xNVQxNTo1NjoyOFrOGGAimA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwODk1MzQ5Ng==", "bodyText": "optional... if it's a bit clearer.\n\n  \n    \n  \n    \n\n  \n  This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

The common use case of\n-query-time lookups is to replace one dimension value (e.g. a String ID) with another value (e.g. a human-readable String value). This is similar to a star-schema join.\n+1. [Join](datasource.md#join) operators. These are available using a [join datasource](datasource.md#join) in native\n+queries, or using the [JOIN operator](sql.md#query-syntax) in Druid SQL. Refer to the\n+[join datasource](datasource.md#join) documentation for information about how joins work in Druid.\n+2. [Query-time lookups](lookups.md), simple key-to-value mappings. These are preloaded on all servers and can be\n+accessed with or without an explicit join operator. Refer to the [lookups](lookups.md) documentation for more details.\n \n-Druid does not yet have full support for joins. Although Druid\u2019s storage format would allow for the implementation\n-of joins (there is no loss of fidelity for columns included as dimensions), full support for joins have not yet been implemented yet\n-for the following reasons:\n-\n-1. Scaling join queries has been, in our professional experience,\n-a constant bottleneck of working with distributed databases.\n-2. The incremental gains in functionality are perceived to be\n-of less value than the anticipated problems with managing\n-highly concurrent, join-heavy workloads.\n-\n-A join query is essentially the merging of two or more streams of data based on a shared set of keys. The primary\n-high-level strategies for join queries we are aware of are a hash-based strategy or a\n-sorted-merge strategy. The hash-based strategy requires that all but\n-one data set be available as something that looks like a hash table,\n-a lookup operation is then performed on this hash table for every\n-row in the \u201cprimary\u201d stream. The sorted-merge strategy assumes\n-that each stream is sorted by the join key and thus allows for the incremental\n-joining of the streams. Each of these strategies, however,\n-requires the materialization of some number of the streams either in\n-sorted order or in a hash table form.\n-\n-When all sides of the join are significantly large tables (> 1 billion\n-records), materializing the pre-join streams requires complex\n-distributed memory management. The complexity of the memory\n-management is only amplified by the fact that we are targeting highly\n-concurrent, multi-tenant workloads.\n+Whenever possible, for best performance it is good to avoid joins at query time.

Stacking joins on top of each other allows\n+you to join arbitrarily many datasources.\n+\n+In Druid {{DRUIDVERSION}}, joins are implemented with a broadcast hash-join algorithm. This means that all tables\n+other than the leftmost \"base\" table must fit in memory. It also means that the join condition must be an equality. This\n+feature is intended mainly to allow joining regular Druid tables with [lookup](#lookup), [inline](#inline), and\n+[query](#query) datasources.\n+\n+For information about how Druid executes queries involving joins, refer to the\n+[Query execution](query-execution.html#join) page.\n+\n+#### Joins in SQL\n+\n+SQL joins take the form:\n+\n+```\n+<o1> [ INNER | LEFT [OUTER] ] JOIN <o2> ON <condition>\n+```\n+\n+The condition must involve only equalities, but functions are okay, and there can be multiple equalities ANDed together.\n+Conditions like `t1.x = t2.x`, or `LOWER(t1.x) = t2.x`, or `t1.x = t2.x AND t1.y = t2.y` can all be handled. Conditions\n+like `t1.x <> t2.x` cannot currently be handled.\n \n-### Union datasource\n+Note that Druid SQL is less rigid than what native join datasources can handle. In cases where a SQL query does\n+something that is not allowed as-is with a native join datasource, Druid SQL will generate a subquery. This can have\n+a substantial effect on performance and scalability, so it is something to watch out for. Some examples of when the\n+SQL layer will generate subqueries include:\n \n-This data source unions two or more table data sources.\n+- Joining a regular Druid table to itself, or to another regular Druid table. The native join datasource can accept\n+a table on the left-hand side, but not the right, so a subquery is needed.\n \n+- Join conditions where the expressions on either side are of different types.\n+\n+- Join conditions where the right-hand expression is not a direct column access.\n+\n+For more information about how Druid translates SQL to native queries, refer to the\n+[Druid SQL](sql.md#query-translation) documentation.\n+\n+#### Joins in native queries\n+\n+Native join datasources have the following properties. All are required.\n+\n+|Field|Description|\n+|-----|-----------|\n+|`left`|Left-hand datasource. Must be of type `table`, `join`, `lookup`, `query`, or `inline`. Placing another join as the left datasource allows you to join arbitrarily many datasources.|\n+|`right`|Right-hand datasource. Must be of type `lookup`, `query`, or `inline`. Note that this is more rigid than what Druid SQL requires.|\n+|`rightPrefix`|String prefix that will be applied to all columns from the right-hand datasource, to prevent them from colliding with columns from the left-hand datasource. Can be any string, so long as it is nonempty and is not be a prefix of the string `__time`. Any columns from the left-hand side that start with your `rightPrefix` will be shadowed. It is up to you to provide a prefix that will not shadow any important columns from the left side.|\n+|`condition`|[Expression](../misc/math-expr.md) that must be an equality where one side is an expression of the left-hand side, and the other side is a simple column reference to the right-hand side. Note that this is more rigid than what Druid SQL requires: here, the right-hand reference must be a simple column reference; in SQL it can be an expression.|\n+|`joinType`|`INNER` or `LEFT`.|\n+\n+#### Join performance\n+\n+Joins are a feature that can significantly affect performance of your queries. Some performance tips and notes:\n+\n+1. Joins are especially useful with [lookup datasources](#lookup), but in most cases, the\n+[`LOOKUP` function](sql.html#string-functions) performs better than a join. Consider using the `LOOKUP` function if\n+it is appropriate for your use case.\n+2. When using joins in Druid SQL, keep in mind that it can generate subqueries that you did not explicitly include in\n+your queries. Refer to the [Druid SQL](sql.md#query-translation) documentation for more details about when this happens\n+and how to detect it.\n+3. One common reason for implicit subquery generation is if the types of the two halves of an equality do not match.\n+For example, since lookup keys are always strings, the condition `druid.d JOIN lookup.l ON d.field = l.field` will\n+perform best if `d.field` is a string.\n+4. As of Druid {{DRUIDVERSION}}, the join operator must evaluate the condition for each row. In the future, we expect\n+to implement both early and deferred condition evaluation, which we expect to improve performance considerably for\n+common use cases.\n+\n+#### Future work for joins\n+\n+Joins are an area of active development in Druid. The following features are missing today but may appear in\n+future versions:\n+\n+- Preloaded dimension tables that are wider than lookups (i.e. supporting more than a single key and single value).\n+- RIGHT OUTER and FULL OUTER joins. Currently, they are partially implemented. Queries will run but results will not\n+always be correct.\n+- Performance-related optimizations as mentioned in the [previous section](#join-performance).\n+- Join algorithms other than broadcast hash-joins.\n+\n+### `union`\n+\n+<!--DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->\n+<!--Native-->\n ```json\n {\n-       \"type\": \"union\",\n-       \"dataSources\": [\"<string_value1>\", \"<string_value2>\", \"<string_value3>\", ... ]\n+  \"queryType\": \"scan\",\n+  \"dataSource\": {\n+    \"type\": \"union\",\n+    \"dataSources\": [\"<dataSourceName1>\", \"<dataSourceName2>\", \"<dataSourceName3>\"]\n+  },\n+  \"columns\": [\"column1\", \"column2\"],\n+  \"intervals\": [\"0000/3000\"]\n }\n ```\n+<!--END_DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->\n \n-Note that the data sources being unioned should have the same schema.\n-Union Queries should be always sent to a Broker/Router process and are *NOT* supported directly by the Historical processes.\n+Union datasources allow you to treat two or more table datasources as a single datasource.

Stacking joins on top of each other allows\n+you to join arbitrarily many datasources.\n+\n+In Druid {{DRUIDVERSION}}, joins are implemented with a broadcast hash-join algorithm. This means that all tables\n+other than the leftmost \"base\" table must fit in memory. It also means that the join condition must be an equality. This\n+feature is intended mainly to allow joining regular Druid tables with [lookup](#lookup), [inline](#inline), and\n+[query](#query) datasources.\n+\n+For information about how Druid executes queries involving joins, refer to the\n+[Query execution](query-execution.html#join) page.\n+\n+#### Joins in SQL\n+\n+SQL joins take the form:\n+\n+```\n+<o1> [ INNER | LEFT [OUTER] ] JOIN <o2> ON <condition>\n+```\n+\n+The condition must involve only equalities, but functions are okay, and there can be multiple equalities ANDed together.\n+Conditions like `t1.x = t2.x`, or `LOWER(t1.x) = t2.x`, or `t1.x = t2.x AND t1.y = t2.y` can all be handled. Conditions\n+like `t1.x <> t2.x` cannot currently be handled.\n \n-### Union datasource\n+Note that Druid SQL is less rigid than what native join datasources can handle. In cases where a SQL query does\n+something that is not allowed as-is with a native join datasource, Druid SQL will generate a subquery. This can have\n+a substantial effect on performance and scalability, so it is something to watch out for. Some examples of when the\n+SQL layer will generate subqueries include:\n \n-This data source unions two or more table data sources.\n+- Joining a regular Druid table to itself, or to another regular Druid table. The native join datasource can accept\n+a table on the left-hand side, but not the right, so a subquery is needed.\n \n+- Join conditions where the expressions on either side are of different types.\n+\n+- Join conditions where the right-hand expression is not a direct column access.\n+\n+For more information about how Druid translates SQL to native queries, refer to the\n+[Druid SQL](sql.md#query-translation) documentation.\n+\n+#### Joins in native queries\n+\n+Native join datasources have the following properties. All are required.\n+\n+|Field|Description|\n+|-----|-----------|\n+|`left`|Left-hand datasource. Must be of type `table`, `join`, `lookup`, `query`, or `inline`. Placing another join as the left datasource allows you to join arbitrarily many datasources.|\n+|`right`|Right-hand datasource. Must be of type `lookup`, `query`, or `inline`. Note that this is more rigid than what Druid SQL requires.|\n+|`rightPrefix`|String prefix that will be applied to all columns from the right-hand datasource, to prevent them from colliding with columns from the left-hand datasource. Can be any string, so long as it is nonempty and is not be a prefix of the string `__time`. Any columns from the left-hand side that start with your `rightPrefix` will be shadowed. It is up to you to provide a prefix that will not shadow any important columns from the left side.|\n+|`condition`|[Expression](../misc/math-expr.md) that must be an equality where one side is an expression of the left-hand side, and the other side is a simple column reference to the right-hand side. Note that this is more rigid than what Druid SQL requires: here, the right-hand reference must be a simple column reference; in SQL it can be an expression.|\n+|`joinType`|`INNER` or `LEFT`.|\n+\n+#### Join performance\n+\n+Joins are a feature that can significantly affect performance of your queries. Some performance tips and notes:\n+\n+1. Joins are especially useful with [lookup datasources](#lookup), but in most cases, the\n+[`LOOKUP` function](sql.html#string-functions) performs better than a join. Consider using the `LOOKUP` function if\n+it is appropriate for your use case.\n+2. When using joins in Druid SQL, keep in mind that it can generate subqueries that you did not explicitly include in\n+your queries. Refer to the [Druid SQL](sql.md#query-translation) documentation for more details about when this happens\n+and how to detect it.\n+3. One common reason for implicit subquery generation is if the types of the two halves of an equality do not match.\n+For example, since lookup keys are always strings, the condition `druid.d JOIN lookup.l ON d.field = l.field` will\n+perform best if `d.field` is a string.\n+4. As of Druid {{DRUIDVERSION}}, the join operator must evaluate the condition for each row. In the future, we expect\n+to implement both early and deferred condition evaluation, which we expect to improve performance considerably for\n+common use cases.\n+\n+#### Future work for joins\n+\n+Joins are an area of active development in Druid. The following features are missing today but may appear in\n+future versions:\n+\n+- Preloaded dimension tables that are wider than lookups (i.e. supporting more than a single key and single value).\n+- RIGHT OUTER and FULL OUTER joins. Currently, they are partially implemented. Queries will run but results will not\n+always be correct.\n+- Performance-related optimizations as mentioned in the [previous section](#join-performance).\n+- Join algorithms other than broadcast hash-joins.\n+\n+### `union`\n+\n+<!--DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->\n+<!--Native-->\n ```json\n {\n-       \"type\": \"union\",\n-       \"dataSources\": [\"<string_value1>\", \"<string_value2>\", \"<string_value3>\", ... ]\n+  \"queryType\": \"scan\",\n+  \"dataSource\": {\n+    \"type\": \"union\",\n+    \"dataSources\": [\"<dataSourceName1>\", \"<dataSourceName2>\", \"<dataSourceName3>\"]\n+  },\n+  \"columns\": [\"column1\", \"column2\"],\n+  \"intervals\": [\"0000/3000\"]\n }\n ```\n+<!--END_DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->\n \n-Note that the data sources being unioned should have the same schema.\n-Union Queries should be always sent to a Broker/Router process and are *NOT* supported directly by the Historical processes.\n+Union datasources allow you to treat two or more table datasources as a single datasource.

Note that this is more rigid than what Druid SQL requires: here, the right-hand reference must be a simple column reference; in SQL it can be an expression.|\n+|`joinType`|`INNER` or `LEFT`.|\n+\n+#### Join performance\n+\n+Joins are a feature that can significantly affect performance of your queries. Some performance tips and notes:\n+\n+1. Joins are especially useful with [lookup datasources](#lookup), but in most cases, the\n+[`LOOKUP` function](sql.html#string-functions) performs better than a join. Consider using the `LOOKUP` function if\n+it is appropriate for your use case.\n+2. When using joins in Druid SQL, keep in mind that it can generate subqueries that you did not explicitly include in\n+your queries. Refer to the [Druid SQL](sql.md#query-translation) documentation for more details about when this happens\n+and how to detect it.\n+3. One common reason for implicit subquery generation is if the types of the two halves of an equality do not match.\n+For example, since lookup keys are always strings, the condition `druid.d JOIN lookup.l ON d.field = l.field` will\n+perform best if `d.field` is a string.\n+4. As of Druid {{DRUIDVERSION}}, the join operator must evaluate the condition for each row. In the future, we expect\n+to implement both early and deferred condition evaluation, which we expect to improve performance considerably for\n+common use cases.\n+\n+#### Future work for joins\n+\n+Joins are an area of active development in Druid. The following features are missing today but may appear in\n+future versions:\n+\n+- Preloaded dimension tables that are wider than lookups (i.e. supporting more than a single key and single value).\n+- RIGHT OUTER and FULL OUTER joins. Currently, they are partially implemented. Queries will run but results will not\n+always be correct.\n+- Performance-related optimizations as mentioned in the [previous section](#join-performance).\n+- Join algorithms other than broadcast hash-joins.\n+\n+### `union`\n+\n+<!--DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->\n+<!--Native-->\n ```json\n {\n-       \"type\": \"union\",\n-       \"dataSources\": [\"<string_value1>\", \"<string_value2>\", \"<string_value3>\", ... ]\n+  \"queryType\": \"scan\",\n+  \"dataSource\": {\n+    \"type\": \"union\",\n+    \"dataSources\": [\"<dataSourceName1>\", \"<dataSourceName2>\", \"<dataSourceName3>\"]\n+  },\n+  \"columns\": [\"column1\", \"column2\"],\n+  \"intervals\": [\"0000/3000\"]\n }\n ```\n+<!--END_DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->\n \n-Note that the data sources being unioned should have the same schema.\n-Union Queries should be always sent to a Broker/Router process and are *NOT* supported directly by the Historical processes.\n+Union datasources allow you to treat two or more table datasources as a single datasource.
