However, the integration tests rely on a set of existing Model classes, in testmodels, that require the old strategy. To re-enable the AWS API Plugin instrumentation tests, this PR re-instates the original behavior of the Date type. To accomodate the new improvements that had been made, a new AWSTimestamp type it added. It will behave how the new use of Date would have, and the Amplify CLI should code-gen using this new type in place of Date.\n\n\nThe method count in the single dex file for the AWS API Plugin instrumentation tests now exceeds the limit of 64k methods. To address this, multi-dex support is added (it is needed only for devices < API 21, which we do target, as our minSdk is 16.)\n\n\nIgnore a flaky storage around pause/resume.\n\n\nBy submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.", "createdAt": "2020-05-05T06:55:47Z", "url": "https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-android/pull/424", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "be8560576ed6d22da73b5b7239e942401309c7be"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-05-05T21:04:02Z", "author": {"login": "jamesonwilliams"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 12, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABceOg6lABqjMzMDI4OTg3NjQ=", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABceaQB3gBqjMzMDU5Mjk3Mzc=", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "HeadRefForcePushedEvent", "beforeCommit": null, "afterCommit": null}, {"__typename": "HeadRefForcePushedEvent", "beforeCommit": null, "afterCommit": null}, {"__typename": "HeadRefForcePushedEvent", "beforeCommit": null, "afterCommit": null}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDA1NTY3MzA3", "url": "https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-android/pull/424#pullrequestreview-405567307", "createdAt": "2020-05-05T07:59:18Z", "commit": null, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 5, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNS0wNVQwNzo1OToxOFrOGQeZSQ==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNS0wNVQwODowNDo0MlrOGQekrg==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQxOTkyODM5Mw==", "bodyText": "Does this change need to be relayed to the CLI team again?", "url": "https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-android/pull/424#discussion_r419928393", "createdAt": "2020-05-05T07:59:18Z", "author": {"login": "raphkim"}, "path": "testmodels/src/main/java/com/amplifyframework/testmodels/meeting/Meeting.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -31,7 +31,7 @@\n     private final @ModelField(targetType=\"AWSDate\") AWSDate date;\n     private final @ModelField(targetType=\"AWSDateTime\") AWSDateTime dateTime;\n     private final @ModelField(targetType=\"AWSTime\") AWSTime time;\n-    private final @ModelField(targetType=\"AWSTimestamp\") Date timestamp;\n+    private final @ModelField(targetType=\"AWSTimestamp\") AWSTimestamp timestamp;", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": null, "originalPosition": 25}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQxOTkzMDA0MA==", "bodyText": "I think it would be helpful to provide additional constructors like\npublic AWSTimestamp(Date date);\npublic AWSTimestamp(String text);\n\nI think we should try to strongly associate Date with our new formats since it is what the customers are likely more familiar with.
