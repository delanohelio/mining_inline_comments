Amplify codifies best practices through\n+programmatic interfaces that reduce the effort needed to interact with\n+cloud resources.\n+\n+First and foremost, Amplify exposes to you _what_ things do, and then\n+_how_ best to do them. The \"_what_\" is a functional use case, and\n+\"_how_\" is an opinionated implementation that you can override with\n+\"escape hatches.\" This will allow you to have higher velocity and build\n+better applications by focusing less on implementation choices.\n+\n+Secondly, Amplify is a manifestation of\n+[The Rule of Least Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_least_power)\n+when developing against AWS. This means it encourages architectural and\n+programmatic best practices that enable you to start quickly.  This\n+shows by encouraging certain services (API Gateway usage vs. direct\n+DynamoDB interaction) or certain connection patterns (Circuit breaker,\n+retry counts and throttle up/down).\n+\n+__Opinionated implementations__: There are many ways to interface with AWS\n+Services. Certain service interactions are favored over others. For instance, if\n+sending and receiving JSON, we would prefer an API Gateway endpoint to other\n+mechanisms. Amplify will programmatically help optimize for cost and\n+performance through library decisions.\n+\n+__Declarative actions__: Amplify will provide you a reference to a generic client\n+object and offer an ability to perform common actions: \"RegisterUser\", \"Login\",\n+\"SendObject\", \"UpdateObject\", \"StreamData\". By default, you should not need to\n+worry about AWS-service-specific API operations like `putItem()` with a unique\n+hash -- or even which HTTP verbs to use.\n+\n+__Cascading service interactions__: Certain actions in a declarative style can have\n+overlapping or ambiguous AWS Service implementations. With an opinionated\n+implementation we can decide which Services are \"primary\" and which are\n+\"secondary\" depending on what is configured. For instance sending an image will\n+prefer S3 over API Gateway..\n+\n+__Simple, standard data objects__: Sending & Receiving data to AWS Services can\n+have many parameters, which tend to show up in the SDKs. These are abstracted\n+and inferred, where possible, with simple JSON that the implementation can\n+reason about. Standard parameters (bucket names, stream names, partition keys,\n+etc.) that are part of the implementation are extracted from a simplified\n+configuration file and dynamically generated/updated in order to further allow\n+focus on state and data types only.\n+\n+### Amplify Design\n+As more and more modules are introduced to AWS Amplify, there is a clear\n+necessity to modularize the library into smaller pieces so that users\n+could avoid importing unnecessary parts into their app. The goal of this\n+design is to make AWS Amplify modularized and also keep it backward\n+compatible to avoid breaking changes.\n+\n+Modular import prevents unnecessary code dependencies are included with the\n+app, and thus decreases the bundle size and enables adding new functionality\n+without the risk of introducing errors related to the unused code.\n+\n+Amplify has established the concepts of categories and plugins. A\n+__category__ is a collection of api calls that are exposed to the client\n+to do things inside that category. For example, in the storage category\n+generally one wants to upload and download objects from storage so the\n+apis exposed to the client will represent that functionality. Because\n+Amplify is pluggable, a __plugin__ of your choosing will provide the\n+actual implementation behind that api interface.  Using the same example\n+of Storage, the plugin we choose might be `AWSS3StoragePlugin`, which\n+would then implement each api call from the category with a service call\n+or set of service calls to S3, the underlying storage provider of the\n+AWS plugin.\n+\n+## Getting Started\n+\n+First, ensure that you have installed the latest stable version of Android\n+Studio / the Android SDK.\n+\n+Configure your environment, so that the `ANDROID_HOME` and `JAVA_HOME`\n+environment variables are set. A convenient way of doing this is to add them\n+into `~/.bashrc`.\u00a0On a Mac, the SDK and Java installation used by the SDK may\n+be found:\n+\n+```\n+export ANDROID_HOME=~/Library/Android/sdk\n+export JAVA_HOME=/Applications/Android\\ Studio.app/Contents/jre/jdk/Contents/Home\n+```\n+Note: JDK 11, 12, 13, etc. have known issues and are not supported.\n+\n+Now, clone the Amplify Android project from GitHub.\n+\n+```\n+git clone git@github.com:aws-amplify/amplify-android.git\n+```\n+Load this project into Android Studio by selecting File > Open, and choosing\n+the root directory of the project (`amplify-android`). Alternately, cd into this\n+top-level directory.\n+\n+In Android Studio, build the project by clicking the Hammer icon, \"Make Project\n+\u2318F9\". If working on the command line, you can do the same thing via:\n+\n+```\n+./gradlew build\n+```\n+\n+## Tools\n+[Gradle](https://gradle.org) is used for all [build and dependency management](https://developer.android.com/studio/build).\n+\n+Some widely used dependencies are:\n+\n+1. [org.json](https://developer.android.com/reference/org/json/JSONObject) is\n+   baked into Android, and is used for all modeling with JSON.\n+2. [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson/blob/master/README.md#gson) is used\n+   for serialization and deserialization.\n+3. [OkHttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp#okhttp) is used for network operations.\n+\n+_Unit and component tests_, which run on your development machine, use:\n+\n+1. [jUnit](https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/blob/r4.13/README.md#junit-4), to make assertions\n+2. [Mockito](https://javadoc.io/static/org.mockito/mockito-core/1.10.19/org/mockito/Mockito.html#1), to mock dependencies\n+3. [Robolectric](https://github.com/robolectric/robolectric/blob/master/README.md),\n+   to simulate an Android device when unit tests execute on your machine.\n+\n+_Instrumentation tests_, which run on an Android device or emulator use\n+AndroidX test core, runner, and a jUnit extension. See Android's notes on\n+[using AndroidX for test](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/set-up-project).\n+\n+## Workflows\n+\n+### Adding code to support a new feature\n+\n+Be aware of the Getting Started and Pull Request guides. This portion deals\n+actually with changing some code.\n+\n+First, identify the module you'll modify:\n+\n+ - `core` - The framework itself, including category behavior definitions\n+ - `aws-datastore` - The AppSync Local implementation of the datastore contract\n+ - `aws-api` - A utility to talk to GraphQL and REST endpoints\n+ - `aws-storage-s3` - Wrapper around S3\n+ - `aws-analytics-pinpoint` - Wrapper around Pinpoint\n+ - `testutilts` - Utility code, helpful when writing unit and instrumentation\n+\ttests. A lot of it deals with making async code synchronous, for more\n+    legible tests.\n+ - `testmodels` - Models that are used in test code. These were generated by\n+    the Amplify CLI / code-gen. We have them checked-in to be sure they don't\n+    change and break some tests.\n+\n+You should proceed by creating a new Java file, and writing your feature in\n+isolation. This way, you can write independent unit tests for your feature.\n+Unit tests are required for all features being added to the code-base. Once you\n+have the skeleton of your feature working, you can integrate it into the\n+existing source files.\n+\n+Writing good Android code and good tests is far outside the scope of this\n+document. But, to get started, you can use the templates below which show some\n+conventions and expectations for source files in the Android codebase.\n+\n+For example, let's say you want to add a `Merger` component to the AppSync\n+Local implementation. Create a file in that module, and a unit test for it:\n+\n+```\n+aws-datastore/src/main/com/amplifyframework/datastore/syncengine/Merger.java\n+aws-datastore/src/test/com/amplifyframework/datastore/syncengine/MergerTest.java\n+```\n+\n+The code below might be a reasonable template for these new files.\n+\n+```\n+/*\n+ * Copyright 2020 Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates.

Before sending us a pull request, please ensure that:\n \n-1. You are working against the latest source on the *master* branch.\n-2. You check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't addressed the problem already.\n-3. You open an issue to discuss any significant work - we would hate for your time to be wasted.\n+This is mostly the same as [GitHub's guide on creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).\n \n-To send us a pull request, please:\n+First, create a _fork_ of `amplify-android`. Clone it, and make changes to this _fork_.\n \n-1. Fork the repository.\n-2. Modify the source; please focus on the specific change you are contributing. If you also reformat all the code, it will be hard for us to focus on your change.\n-3. Ensure local tests pass.\n-4. Commit to your fork using clear commit messages.\n-5. Send us a pull request, answering any default questions in the pull request interface.\n-6. Pay attention to any automated CI failures reported in the pull request, and stay involved in the conversation.\n+```\n+git clone git@github.com:your_username/amplify-android.git \n+```\n \n-GitHub provides additional document on [forking a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and\n-[creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).\n+After you have tested your feature/fix, by adding sufficient test coverage, and\n+validating Checkstyle, lint, and the existing test suites, you're ready to\n+publish your change.\n \n+The commit message should look like below. It started with a bracketed tag\n+stating which module has been the focus of the change. After a paragraph\n+describing what you've done, include links to useful resources.

Amplify codifies best practices through\n+programmatic interfaces that reduce the effort needed to interact with\n+cloud resources.\n+\n+First and foremost, Amplify exposes to you _what_ things do, and then\n+_how_ best to do them. The \"_what_\" is a functional use case, and\n+\"_how_\" is an opinionated implementation that you can override with\n+\"escape hatches.\" This will allow you to have higher velocity and build\n+better applications by focusing less on implementation choices.\n+\n+Secondly, Amplify is a manifestation of\n+[The Rule of Least Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_least_power)\n+when developing against AWS. This means it encourages architectural and\n+programmatic best practices that enable you to start quickly.  This\n+shows by encouraging certain services (API Gateway usage vs. direct\n+DynamoDB interaction) or certain connection patterns (Circuit breaker,\n+retry counts and throttle up/down).\n+\n+__Opinionated implementations__: There are many ways to interface with AWS\n+Services. Certain service interactions are favored over others. For instance, if\n+sending and receiving JSON, we would prefer an API Gateway endpoint to other\n+mechanisms. Amplify will programmatically help optimize for cost and\n+performance through library decisions.\n+\n+__Declarative actions__: Amplify will provide you a reference to a generic client\n+object and offer an ability to perform common actions: \"RegisterUser\", \"Login\",\n+\"SendObject\", \"UpdateObject\", \"StreamData\". By default, you should not need to\n+worry about AWS-service-specific API operations like `putItem()` with a unique\n+hash -- or even which HTTP verbs to use.\n+\n+__Cascading service interactions__: Certain actions in a declarative style can have\n+overlapping or ambiguous AWS Service implementations. With an opinionated\n+implementation we can decide which Services are \"primary\" and which are\n+\"secondary\" depending on what is configured. For instance sending an image will\n+prefer S3 over API Gateway..\n+\n+__Simple, standard data objects__: Sending & Receiving data to AWS Services can\n+have many parameters, which tend to show up in the SDKs. These are abstracted\n+and inferred, where possible, with simple JSON that the implementation can\n+reason about. Standard parameters (bucket names, stream names, partition keys,\n+etc.) that are part of the implementation are extracted from a simplified\n+configuration file and dynamically generated/updated in order to further allow\n+focus on state and data types only.\n+\n+### Amplify Design\n+As more and more modules are introduced to AWS Amplify, there is a clear\n+necessity to modularize the library into smaller pieces so that users\n+could avoid importing unnecessary parts into their app. The goal of this\n+design is to make AWS Amplify modularized and also keep it backward\n+compatible to avoid breaking changes.\n+\n+Modular import prevents unnecessary code dependencies are included with the\n+app, and thus decreases the bundle size and enables adding new functionality\n+without the risk of introducing errors related to the unused code.\n+\n+Amplify has established the concepts of categories and plugins. A\n+__category__ is a collection of api calls that are exposed to the client\n+to do things inside that category. For example, in the storage category\n+generally one wants to upload and download objects from storage so the\n+apis exposed to the client will represent that functionality. Because\n+Amplify is pluggable, a __plugin__ of your choosing will provide the\n+actual implementation behind that api interface.  Using the same example\n+of Storage, the plugin we choose might be `AWSS3StoragePlugin`, which\n+would then implement each api call from the category with a service call\n+or set of service calls to S3, the underlying storage provider of the\n+AWS plugin.\n+\n+## Getting Started\n+\n+First, ensure that you have installed the latest stable version of Android\n+Studio / the Android SDK.\n+\n+Configure your environment, so that the `ANDROID_HOME` and `JAVA_HOME`\n+environment variables are set. A convenient way of doing this is to add them\n+into `~/.bashrc`.\u00a0On a Mac, the SDK and Java installation used by the SDK may\n+be found:\n+\n+```\n+export ANDROID_HOME=~/Library/Android/sdk\n+export JAVA_HOME=/Applications/Android\\ Studio.app/Contents/jre/jdk/Contents/Home\n+```\n+Note: JDK 11, 12, 13, etc. have known issues and are not supported.\n+\n+Now, clone the Amplify Android project from GitHub.\n+\n+```\n+git clone git@github.com:aws-amplify/amplify-android.git\n+```\n+Load this project into Android Studio by selecting File > Open, and choosing\n+the root directory of the project (`amplify-android`). Alternately, cd into this\n+top-level directory.\n+\n+In Android Studio, build the project by clicking the Hammer icon, \"Make Project\n+\u2318F9\". If working on the command line, you can do the same thing via:\n+\n+```\n+./gradlew build\n+```\n+\n+## Tools\n+[Gradle](https://gradle.org) is used for all [build and dependency management](https://developer.android.com/studio/build).\n+\n+Some widely used dependencies are:\n+\n+1.

This portion deals\n+actually with changing some code.\n+\n+First, identify the module you'll modify:\n+\n+ - `core` - The framework itself, including category behavior definitions\n+ - `aws-datastore` - The AppSync Local implementation of the datastore contract\n+ - `aws-api` - A utility to talk to GraphQL and REST endpoints\n+ - `aws-storage-s3` - Wrapper around S3\n+ - `aws-analytics-pinpoint` - Wrapper around Pinpoint\n+ - `testutilts` - Utility code, helpful when writing unit and instrumentation\n+\ttests. A lot of it deals with making async code synchronous, for more\n+    legible tests.\n+ - `testmodels` - Models that are used in test code. These were generated by\n+    the Amplify CLI / code-gen. We have them checked-in to be sure they don't\n+    change and break some tests.\n+\n+You should proceed by creating a new Java file, and writing your feature in\n+isolation. This way, you can write independent unit tests for your feature.\n+Unit tests are required for all features being added to the code-base. Once you\n+have the skeleton of your feature working, you can integrate it into the\n+existing source files.\n+\n+Writing good Android code and good tests is far outside the scope of this\n+document. But, to get started, you can use the templates below which show some\n+conventions and expectations for source files in the Android codebase.\n+\n+For example, let's say you want to add a `Merger` component to the AppSync\n+Local implementation. Create a file in that module, and a unit test for it:\n+\n+```\n+aws-datastore/src/main/com/amplifyframework/datastore/syncengine/Merger.java\n+aws-datastore/src/test/com/amplifyframework/datastore/syncengine/MergerTest.java\n+```\n+\n+The code below might be a reasonable template for these new files.\n+\n+```\n+/*\n+ * Copyright 2020 Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates.

A\n+__category__ is a collection of api calls that are exposed to the client\n+to do things inside that category. For example, in the storage category\n+generally one wants to upload and download objects from storage so the\n+apis exposed to the client will represent that functionality. Because\n+Amplify is pluggable, a __plugin__ of your choosing will provide the\n+actual implementation behind that api interface.  Using the same example\n+of Storage, the plugin we choose might be `AWSS3StoragePlugin`, which\n+would then implement each api call from the category with a service call\n+or set of service calls to S3, the underlying storage provider of the\n+AWS plugin.\n+\n+## Getting Started\n+\n+First, ensure that you have installed the latest stable version of Android\n+Studio / the Android SDK.\n+\n+Configure your environment, so that the `ANDROID_HOME` and `JAVA_HOME`\n+environment variables are set. A convenient way of doing this is to add them\n+into `~/.bashrc`.\u00a0On a Mac, the SDK and Java installation used by the SDK may\n+be found:\n+\n+```\n+export ANDROID_HOME=~/Library/Android/sdk\n+export JAVA_HOME=/Applications/Android\\ Studio.app/Contents/jre/jdk/Contents/Home\n+```\n+Note: JDK 11, 12, 13, etc. have known issues and are not supported.\n+\n+Now, clone the Amplify Android project from GitHub.\n+\n+```\n+git clone git@github.com:aws-amplify/amplify-android.git\n+```\n+Load this project into Android Studio by selecting File > Open, and choosing\n+the root directory of the project (`amplify-android`). Alternately, cd into this\n+top-level directory.\n+\n+In Android Studio, build the project by clicking the Hammer icon, \"Make Project\n+\u2318F9\". If working on the command line, you can do the same thing via:\n+\n+```\n+./gradlew build\n+```\n+\n+## Tools\n+[Gradle](https://gradle.org) is used for all [build and dependency management](https://developer.android.com/studio/build).\n+\n+Some widely used dependencies are:\n+\n+1.
