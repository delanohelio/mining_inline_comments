However, most uses require the same basic set of\nserializers and deserializers, to handle custom Amplify and AppSync\ntypes.\nTo address this, the serializers and deserializesr are consolidated into\nthe aws-api-appsync module. Construction of Gson instances is aligned to\nuse the common GsonFactory, now shared between the API and DataStore\ncategories.\nThe GsonFactory itself is augmented to provided different factory\nmethods, suitable for augmenting the set of adapters in a more\nconfigurable way.\nResolves: #848\nBy submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.", "createdAt": "2020-10-01T20:23:38Z", "url": "https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-android/pull/875", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "dd7d38b4ac9a1442715b1edc293b467480111196"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-10-03T00:17:59Z", "author": {"login": "jamesonwilliams"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 9, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABdOYF2OgFqTUwMDcyNDQ4NQ==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABdOvHU9gBqjM4MzU5ODgwOTQ=", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NTAwNzI0NDg1", "url": "https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-android/pull/875#pullrequestreview-500724485", "createdAt": "2020-10-01T21:16:17Z", "commit": null, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMC0wMVQyMToxNjoxN1rOHbbGEw==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMC0wMVQyMToxNjoxN1rOHbbGEw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5ODUxNzUyMw==", "bodyText": "Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n                private static void withDeserializers(GsonBuilder builder) {\n          \n          \n            \n                private static void withAdapters(GsonBuilder builder) {", "url": "https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-android/pull/875#discussion_r498517523", "createdAt": "2020-10-01T21:16:17Z", "author": {"login": "richardmcclellan"}, "path": "aws-api-appsync/src/main/java/com/amplifyframework/api/aws/GsonFactory.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -26,28 +26,62 @@\n import com.google.gson.GsonBuilder;\n \n import java.util.Collections;\n+import java.util.Date;\n import java.util.Map;\n \n-final class GsonFactory {\n+/**\n+ * A utility to create a {@link Gson} instance with serialization and deserialization\n+ * suitable for various Amplify and AppSync types.\n+ */\n+public final class GsonFactory {\n     private GsonFactory() {}\n \n-    static Gson create() {\n+    /**\n+     * Creates a new {@link Gson} instance with basic serializers and deserializers\n+     * needed by Amplify and AppSync.\n+     * @return A {@link Gson} instance that may be used to convert Amplify and AppSync\n+     *         types to/from JSON\n+     */\n+    public static Gson create() {\n         return create(Collections.emptyMap());\n     }\n \n-    static Gson create(@NonNull Map<Class<?>, Object> additionalAdapters) {\n-        GsonBuilder builder = new GsonBuilder();\n+    /**\n+     * Creates a new {@link Gson} instance by adding basic serialization and deserialization\n+     * adapters on top of anything that may be configured in the provided {@link GsonBuilder}.\n+     * Note that already-configured attached to the builder may be overridden.\n+     * @param builder A {@link GsonBuilder}\n+     * @return A {@link Gson} instance\n+     */\n+    public static Gson create(GsonBuilder builder) {\n         withDeserializers(builder);\n-        withAdditionalAdapters(builder, additionalAdapters);\n         return builder.create();\n     }\n \n+    /**\n+     * Creates a new {@link Gson} instance with basic serializers and deserializers,\n+     * in addition to the provided ser-de adapters.
