Save, query, and observe changes to your data\n+from a local repository. Let DataStore synchronize your local data with\n+the Cloud. Our default implemenation syncs local data to/from a DynamoDB\n+database, via an AppSync front-end.\n+\n+### [REST APIs](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/restapi/getting-started/q/platform/android):\n+\n+Easy auth and request signing against multiple REST endpoints. Our\n+default plugin works great with Amazon API Gateway.\n+\n+### [GraphQL APIs](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/graphqlapi/getting-started/q/platform/android)\n+\n+Data modeling and simple auth against GraphQL endpoints.
