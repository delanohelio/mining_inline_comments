Anything random about this step is seeded from this method, and I can't see that the method is used anywhere else, so getCarverSeed is a good name given proper Javadocs. Caves and ravines use it only because they use a StructureStart.\n\nIt creates a seed from arbitrary region coordinates which are later used for determining chunk coordinates.\n\nWhere it's used is what's important in the naming. This method is used to seed the Random to choose to position of the structure, and sometimes whether the structure will spawn or not. The fact that it's used for regions is already encoded in the parameters like I said, and arguably this is less important than the fact the seed is used for structure locations, so the latter is what should be in the name.\nAs an aside, in village generation in Bedrock edition they actually messed up the region coordinates and passed in chunk coordinates instead, and it barely makes a difference (other than the occasional overlapping village). This further strengthens the point that the word \"structure\" is more important to have in the name than \"region\", but \"region\" is still important so it should go in the Javadocs as well as the parameter names.
