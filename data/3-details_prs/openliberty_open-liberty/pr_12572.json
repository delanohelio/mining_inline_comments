Currently this message will indicate an invalid combination of Java EE features.  As new Jakarta EE levels (programming models) are introduced, this message will indicate the user configured an invalid combination of Java EE feature or an invalid combination of Jakarta EE features, exclusively.  The two configured features indicated in the message are provisioned, which is the same behavior as when the error was reported as CWWKF0033E.\nMessage CWWKF0044E indicates the user configured an invalid combination of features for incompatible EE platforms.  Currently this message will indicate an invalid combination of Jakarta EE 9 and Java EE features, including Jakarta EE 8.  The two conflicting features are not provisioned, and the configured features are provisioned; which will force bundle resolution failures during startup.\nThis solution also changes the feature manager to log only the most important conflict error for a particular pair of configured features.  It does so by ranking resolver conflicts by type -- eeCompatible, public, protected... -- and dependency chain length.  And then for any configured feature pair that appears in the list of conflicts, the feature manager logs an error for the conflict with the greatest type and shortest dependency chain, only.  This change is not specific to eeCompatible feature conflicts.  It alleviates the need to sort through several conflict errors that indicate the same configured feature pair along with various dependency chains to conflicting features, which are typically private (i.e. do not appear in the server configuration.)  All conflicts are logged to FFDC as before, so no information is lost.", "createdAt": "2020-06-11T11:05:02Z", "url": "https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/pull/12572", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "e4d96143771f00460ad0544e1868ae069a8a4340"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-07-08T15:15:28Z", "author": {"login": "dazavala"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 9, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABcqRtYDgBqjM0MzUyMDk2NzI=", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABcudnR8gBqjM0Nzg1NzUzODI=", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "HeadRefForcePushedEvent", "beforeCommit": {"oid": "d475ac49405f85da66a5e7705e4fe8c86e5ecf8e", "author": {"user": {"login": "dazavala", "name": "Dave Zavala"}}, "url": "https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/commit/d475ac49405f85da66a5e7705e4fe8c86e5ecf8e", "committedDate": "2020-06-11T11:00:55Z", "message": "9214 Warn user about javaee and jakartaee compatibility conflicts"}, "afterCommit": {"oid": "9bad1fc272e997131218470809e7f02bc1ba47be", "author": {"user": {"login": "dazavala", "name": "Dave Zavala"}}, "url": "https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/commit/9bad1fc272e997131218470809e7f02bc1ba47be", "committedDate": "2020-06-11T17:27:43Z", "message": "9214 Warn user about javaee and jakartaee compatibility conflicts"}}, {"__typename": "HeadRefForcePushedEvent", "beforeCommit": {"oid": "9bad1fc272e997131218470809e7f02bc1ba47be", "author": {"user": {"login": "dazavala", "name": "Dave Zavala"}}, "url": "https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/commit/9bad1fc272e997131218470809e7f02bc1ba47be", "committedDate": "2020-06-11T17:27:43Z", "message": "9214 Warn user about javaee and jakartaee compatibility conflicts"}, "afterCommit": {"oid": "7b5a10701107a38a34591f245eac91a9bd167fb8", "author": {"user": {"login": "dazavala", "name": "Dave Zavala"}}, "url": "https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/commit/7b5a10701107a38a34591f245eac91a9bd167fb8", "committedDate": "2020-06-11T17:46:46Z", "message": "9214 Warn user about javaee and jakartaee compatibility conflicts"}}, {"__typename": "HeadRefForcePushedEvent", "beforeCommit": {"oid": "7b5a10701107a38a34591f245eac91a9bd167fb8", "author": {"user": {"login": "dazavala", "name": "Dave Zavala"}}, "url": "https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/commit/7b5a10701107a38a34591f245eac91a9bd167fb8", "committedDate": "2020-06-11T17:46:46Z", "message": "9214 Warn user about javaee and jakartaee compatibility conflicts"}, "afterCommit": {"oid": "83fc8d32f345c175c3e73f42211aa38ac31218aa", "author": {"user": {"login": "dazavala", "name": "Dave Zavala"}}, "url": "https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/commit/83fc8d32f345c175c3e73f42211aa38ac31218aa", "committedDate": "2020-06-11T18:29:22Z", "message": "9214 Warn user about javaee and jakartaee compatibility conflicts"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDMwOTY5OTU5", "url": "https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/pull/12572#pullrequestreview-430969959", "createdAt": "2020-06-15T20:29:34Z", "commit": {"oid": "83fc8d32f345c175c3e73f42211aa38ac31218aa"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 6, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNi0xNVQyMDoyOTozNFrOGkBn5Q==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNi0xNVQyMDozOToyNlrOGkB7Lw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0MDQyODUxNw==", "bodyText": "change\nThe configured feature {2} of {0}\nto\nThe configured {2} feature of the {0} EE platform\nchange\nthe configured feature {3} of {1}\nto\nthe configured {2} feature of the {0} EE platform\nchange\nof {4} features\nto\nof {4} EE platform features\nchange\nUpdate server.xml to remove the incompatible features.\nto\nUpdate the server.xml file to remove the incompatible features.", "url": "https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/pull/12572#discussion_r440428517", "createdAt": "2020-06-15T20:29:34Z", "author": {"login": "jantley-ibm"}, "path": "dev/com.ibm.ws.kernel.feature.core/resources/com/ibm/ws/kernel/feature/internal/resources/ProvisionerMessages.nlsprops", "diffHunk": "@@ -200,12 +200,22 @@ UPDATE_WRONG_PROCESS_TYPE_DEPENDENCY_CLIENT_ERROR=CWWKF0041E: The {0} feature on\n UPDATE_WRONG_PROCESS_TYPE_DEPENDENCY_CLIENT_ERROR.explanation=The configured feature does not support the specified process type.\n UPDATE_WRONG_PROCESS_TYPE_DEPENDENCY_CLIENT_ERROR.useraction=Remove the feature from the configuration or change the feature manifest file to enable support for the desired process type.\n \n-# CWWK042E  {0} = feature Name: {1} = server name \n-UPDATE_MISSING_CORE_FEATURE_ERROR=CWWKF0042E: A feature definition cannot  be found for the  {0} feature.
