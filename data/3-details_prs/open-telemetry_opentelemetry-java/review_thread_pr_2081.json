So the most standard option doesn't seem great.\nI have a personal preference for zulu, mainly because of the TCK thing but see the ecosystem consolidating on adopt (GitHub planning to switch from zulu to adopt does mean something), which is why I went with it here. Admittedly the TCK issue seems theoretical given they are in the end effectively the same codebase, and both have wide adoption.\nI think a link is far more user friendly than no link. Given our Gradle build already automatically downloads adopt if Java 11 or 8 isn't installed, I am leaning strongly for not making a change to this url.
