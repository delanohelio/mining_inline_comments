API specifying the name and version of the library \n+instrumenting the instrumented library or application to be monitored. \n+More information is available in the specification chapter [Obtaining a Tracer].\n+\n+```java\n+Tracer tracer = OpenTelemetry.getTracerRegistry().get(\"instrumentation-library-name\",\"semver:1.0.0\");\n+```\n+\n+[Obtaining a Tracer]:

processes.\n+For more details how to share context between remote processes, see [Context Propagation](#context-propagation).\n+\n+For a method `A` calling a method `B`, the spans could be manually linked in the following way:\n+```java\n+void a() {\n+  Span parentSpan = tracer.spanBuilder(\"a\").startSpan();\n+  b(parentSpan);\n+  parentSpan.end();\n+}\n+void b(Span parentSpan) {\n+  Span

called.\n+ \n+First, a `Tracer` must be acquired, which is responsible for creating spans and interacting with the [Context](#context-propagation).\n+A tracer is acquired by using the OpenTelemetry API specifying the name and version of the library \n+instrumenting the instrumented library or application to be monitored. \n+More information is available in the specification chapter [Obtaining a Tracer].\n+\n+```java\n+Tracer tracer = OpenTelemetry.getTracerRegistry().get(\"instrumentation-library-name\",\"semver:1.0.0\");\n+```\n+\n+[Obtaining a Tracer]:

linked in the following way:\n+```java\n+void a() {\n+  Span parentSpan = tracer.spanBuilder(\"a\").startSpan();\n+  b(parentSpan);\n+  parentSpan.end();\n+}\n+void b(Span parentSpan) {\n+  Span
