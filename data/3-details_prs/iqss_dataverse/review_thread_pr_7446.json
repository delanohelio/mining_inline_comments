These endpoints allow additional, non-Dataverse generated metadata to be added alongside datafiles in dataverse.\n+\n+The support for auxiliary files in Dataverse is being driven by integration with the [Open Differential Privacy (DP) Project](https://opendp.io) and is designed to support the deposit and retrieval of differentially private metadata, but the endpoints are not specific to differential privacy use cases.\n+\n+### Additional Banner Functionality\n+\n+Banners in Dataverse can now be set to allow dismissal by a logged in user. Previously, banners would persist until they were removed by an administrator. This allows administrators to more easily communicate one-time messages to users.\n+\n+### File Tags Searchable from Advanced Search and Dataset Search\n+\n+File tags (\"Documentation\", \"Data\", \"Code\", etc.) now appear on the Advanced Search page.\n+\n+Performing a search for files on the dataset page now includes file tags. Previously, only file name and file description were searched.\n+\n+## Major Use Cases\n+\n+Newly-supported use cases in this release include:\n+\n+- Users can use an API to add auxiliary files to files in order to provide metadata representations for specific tools or integrations (Issue #7275, PR #7350)\n+- Administrators can use a new API to manage banner messages and take advantage of new banner display options (Issue #7263, PR #7434)\n+- Users replacing files will now have their files renamed when a file name conflict exists, making the behavior consistent with upload and edit (Issue #7335, PR #7336)\n+- Users will now be able to search on file tags on the advanced search and dataset pages (Issue #7194, PR #7385)\n+\n+## Notes for Dataverse Installation Administrators\n+\n+### Payara 5.2020.6 Required\n+\n+Some changes in this release require an upgrade to Payara 5.2020.6.\n+\n+Instructions how to update can be found in the\n+[Payara documentation](https://docs.payara.fish/community/docs/5.2020.6/documentation/user-guides/upgrade-payara.html)\n+\n+### New Banner API, Obsolete DB Settings\n+\n+The functionality previously provided by the DB settings :StatusMessageHeader and ::StatusMessageText is no longer supported and is now provided through the Manage Banner Messages API.

See above note about obsolete options.\n+\n+## Notes for Tool Developers and Integrators\n+\n+### Experimental Auxiliary File Support\n+\n+Experimental endpoints have been added to allow auxiliary files to be added to datafiles. These auxiliary files can be deposited and accessed via API. Later releases will include options for accessing these files through the UI.

These endpoints allow additional, non-Dataverse generated metadata to be added alongside datafiles in dataverse.\n+\n+The support for auxiliary files in Dataverse is being driven by integration with the [Open Differential Privacy (DP) Project](https://opendp.io) and is designed to support the deposit and retrieval of differentially private metadata, but the endpoints are not specific to differential privacy use cases.\n+\n+### Additional Banner Functionality\n+\n+Banners in Dataverse can now be set to allow dismissal by a logged in user. Previously, banners would persist until they were removed by an administrator. This allows administrators to more easily communicate one-time messages to users.\n+\n+### File Tags Searchable from Advanced Search and Dataset Search\n+\n+File tags (\"Documentation\", \"Data\", \"Code\", etc.) now appear on the Advanced Search page.\n+\n+Performing a search for files on the dataset page now includes file tags. Previously, only file name and file description were searched.\n+\n+### Easier Configuration of Database Connections\n+\n+Previously, the configuration of the database connections has been quite static and not very easy to update. This has been an issue especially for cloud and container usage. Using new technologies provided by the move to Payara, you can now more easily configure the connection to your PostgreSQL DB.\n+\n+Using MicroProfile Config API (Issue #7000, Issue #7418), you can much more easily specify configuration\n+details.

Learn more in the [API Guide](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/5.3/api/).\n+\n+### New Database Settings and JVM Options\n+\n+Several new JVM options have been added in this release:\n+\n+- dataverse.db.name\n+- dataverse.db.user\n+- dataverse.db.password\n+- dataverse.db.host\n+- dataverse.db.port\n+\n+For an overview of these new options, please see the\n+[Installation Guide](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/5.3/installation/config.html#jvm-options)\n+\n+See above note about obsolete DB options.\n+\n+### Java Message System Configuration\n+\n+The Ingest process uses the Java Message System to create ingest tasks in a queue. That queue had been configured from command line or domain.xml before.
