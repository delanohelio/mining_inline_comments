To authorize the zipdownload for\n+the \"job key\", and inform the zipper on which files to zip and where\n+to find them, the application relies on a database table, that the\n+zipper also has access too. In other words, there is a saved state\n+information associated with each zipped download request. Zipper may\n+be given a limited database access - for example, via a user\n+authorized to access that one table only. After serving the files, the\n+zipper removes the database entries. Job records in the database have\n+time stamps, so on the application side, as an added level of cleanup,\n+it automatically deletes any records older than 5 minutes (can be\n+further reduced) every time the service adds new records; as an added\n+level of cleanup for any records that got stuck in the db because the\n+corresponding zipper jobs never completed. A paranoid admin may choose\n+to give the zipper read-only access to the database, and rely on a\n+cleanup solely on the application side.\n+\n+I have explored ways to avoid maintaining this state information. A\n+potential implementation we discussed early on, where the application\n+would make a network call to the zipper before redirecting the user\n+there, would NOT solve that problem - the state would need to somehow\n+be maintained on the zipper side. The only truly stateless\n+implementation would rely on including all the file information WITH\n+the redirect itself, with some pre-signed URL mechanism to make it\n+secure. Mechanisms for pre-signing requests are readily available and\n+simple to implement. We could go with something similar to how S3\n+presigns their access URLs.
