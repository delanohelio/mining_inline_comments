Upgrading from an earlier version of Payara should be a straightforward process: Undeploy Dataverse; stop Payara; move the current Payara directory out of the way; unzip the new Payara version in its place; replace **the brand new `payara/glassfish/domains/domain1` with your old, preserved `domain1`**; start Payara, deploy Dataverse 5.2.
