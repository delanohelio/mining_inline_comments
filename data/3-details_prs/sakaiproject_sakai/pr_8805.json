However, the queue can only hold one item so any additional requests added to it will overwrite the previous one. This results in only the first and last requests being sent to the server.\nThis issue was identified and fixed for comment grading many years ago. Because the logic for doing grading was copied and pasted between the comment grading and question grading, the problem existed in two places but was only fixed in one.\nThis PR applies the comment grading fix to the question grading, but is mostly about removing the duplication that resulted in the issue being missed in the first place.", "createdAt": "2020-11-11T17:33:45Z", "url": "https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai/pull/8805", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "96cd909f6a61ffccf556c488b11f0657d0ccb418"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-11-11T20:39:59Z", "author": {"login": "plukasew"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 4, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABdbhZv_gH2gAyNTE5MzQ3OTk4OjU2YTk4ZDkwZTllNjYzYjUwYjI1YWMzM2NhOTFhYzljODY5NTE0M2Y=", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABdbhslEgFqTUyODQwMjMyNg==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "56a98d90e9e663b50b25ac33ca91ac9c8695143f", "author": {"user": {"login": "plukasew", "name": null}}, "url": "https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai/commit/56a98d90e9e663b50b25ac33ca91ac9c8695143f", "committedDate": "2020-11-11T17:28:11Z", "message": "SAK-37763 Update points in grading pane of lessons tool"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NTI4MzkwMzgy", "url": "https://github.com/sakaiproject/sakai/pull/8805#pullrequestreview-528390382", "createdAt": "2020-11-11T17:34:06Z", "commit": {"oid": "56a98d90e9e663b50b25ac33ca91ac9c8695143f"}, "state": "CHANGES_REQUESTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0xMVQxNzozNDowN1rOHxXQ9g==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0xMVQxNzozNDowN1rOHxXQ9g==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyMTUyMzQ0Ng==", "bodyText": "Looks like there's a label missing for this input.
