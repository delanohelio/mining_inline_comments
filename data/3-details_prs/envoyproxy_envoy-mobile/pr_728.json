Start a service running Envoy proxy\n+2. Create a mobile app that performs requests to the service using Envoy Mobile\n+3. In our case, we used a man-in-the-middle proxy to observe requests/responses between the two, but this could also be accomplished via logging on the service\n+4. Open the app running Envoy Mobile with a VPN disabled\n+5. Note the ``x-forwarded-for`` header (or the ``x-envoy-external-address`` header which should be the same) of requests from the client\n+6. Enable a VPN on the mobile device\n+7. Monitor the above headers for changes in IP address\n+8. Repeat the same for disabling the VPN\n+\n+On both iOS and Android...\n+\n+With the above workflow, we observed an initial IP address of ``68.7.163.XXX``.\n+\n+Within a second or two of enabling the Hotspot Shield VPN, requests sent\n+from the client changed IP addresses to ``104.232.37.XXX`` - the location of\n+the VPN servers.\n+\n+When launching the app with the VPN enabled, all requests were seen as\n+coming from the VPN IP address.\n+\n+Upon disabling the VPN, some requests failed before switching IP addresses\n+back to the original (non-VPN). This took several seconds (noticeably longer\n+than switching onto the VPN when it was enabled).\n+\n+---------\n+Deep dive\n+---------\n+\n+**Enabling the VPN**\n+\n+Our understanding of why Envoy Mobile sends traffic through VPNs the way it\n+does is as follows.\n+\n+When the library starts up with a VPN enabled, none of its clusters have been\n+used yet. Upon utilizing each cluster, it selects the preferred network to use\n+for establishing a connection. Since the OS is routing all of these through the\n+VPN, Envoy Mobile immediately ends up sending all traffic over the VPN.\n+\n+However, when a VPN is enabled after the library is already running, any number", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "5b59d1db4bf653498c40e32fd84ee12ab5ed31e3"}, "originalPosition": 68}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3MzY5ODk0NDY2", "url": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy-mobile/pull/728#pullrequestreview-369894466", "createdAt": "2020-03-05T20:35:22Z", "commit": {"oid": "5b59d1db4bf653498c40e32fd84ee12ab5ed31e3"}, "state": "DISMISSED", "comments": {"totalCount": 0, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": null, "endCursor": null, "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": []}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "bfb5d1f1342a3411216d586a70a8093f22b2c1f5", "author": {"user": {"login": "rebello95", "name": "Michael Rebello"}}, "url": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy-mobile/commit/bfb5d1f1342a3411216d586a70a8093f22b2c1f5", "committedDate": "2020-03-05T21:11:06Z", "message": "CR\n\nSigned-off-by: Michael Rebello <me@michaelrebello.com>"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3MzY5OTE3Mjk0", "url": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy-mobile/pull/728#pullrequestreview-369917294", "createdAt": "2020-03-05T21:12:13Z", "commit": {"oid": "bfb5d1f1342a3411216d586a70a8093f22b2c1f5"}, "state": "APPROVED", "comments": {"totalCount": 0, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": null, "endCursor": null, "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": []}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 4307, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-01T14:20:25Z"}}}
