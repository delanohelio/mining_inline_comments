This was guarded by some atomic state on the stream. While this was actually one of the more tested areas of the codebase, we're unwinding that for now, and dispatching cancellation the same as any other stream interaction. This is to potentially simplify reasoning about the code to continue investigation of recent crashes. Some tests have been removed that specifically tested concurrency of cancellation, since ordering tests now cover this.\nRisk Level: Moderate\nTesting: Local and CI\nSigned-off-by: Mike Schore mike.schore@gmail.com", "createdAt": "2020-08-27T23:55:14Z", "url": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy-mobile/pull/1056", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "e4d188f4ddd39de67a1293fd61f9ed65463bb945"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-08-29T02:20:44Z", "author": {"login": "goaway"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 10, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABdDJIczgH2gAyNDc1MDA5NTIwOmVhYjJlMDRlNzcxMmE0OGUwOGE0YTIzNzRlMThiMjZmNWNjYzM3OWE=", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABdDe_e5AH2gAyNDc1MDA5NTIwOmU4Y2NiOWI0NzViM2Q0MjJmMGQwN2MwMDE1ODQ1YzQ4Njc1ZTYzYTY=", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "eab2e04e7712a48e08a4a2374e18b26f5ccc379a", "author": {"user": {"login": "goaway", "name": "Mike Schore"}}, "url": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy-mobile/commit/eab2e04e7712a48e08a4a2374e18b26f5ccc379a", "committedDate": "2020-08-27T23:37:23Z", "message": "http dispatcher: serialize all dispatch and state management\n\nSigned-off-by: Mike Schore <mike.schore@gmail.com>"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "0333f5f312c1eb2308589823a1514a88aa18e438", "author": {"user": {"login": "goaway", "name": "Mike Schore"}}, "url": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy-mobile/commit/0333f5f312c1eb2308589823a1514a88aa18e438", "committedDate": "2020-08-27T23:41:11Z", "message": "make closed non-atomic\n\nSigned-off-by: Mike Schore <mike.schore@gmail.com>"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "65b0de233ab311b0794ad8231e58d5a3239b7c15", "author": {"user": {"login": "goaway", "name": "Mike Schore"}}, "url": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy-mobile/commit/65b0de233ab311b0794ad8231e58d5a3239b7c15", "committedDate": "2020-08-27T23:55:58Z", "message": "remove unneeded comment\n\nSigned-off-by: Mike Schore <mike.schore@gmail.com>"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "dbf918a0f783ae22586efea20ef2b3fc310e4469", "author": {"user": {"login": "goaway", "name": "Mike Schore"}}, "url": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy-mobile/commit/dbf918a0f783ae22586efea20ef2b3fc310e4469", "committedDate": "2020-08-28T11:27:49Z", "message": "cleanup and compile tests\n\nSigned-off-by: Mike Schore <mike.schore@gmail.com>"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDc3OTE2ODA1", "url": "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy-mobile/pull/1056#pullrequestreview-477916805", "createdAt": "2020-08-28T17:45:51Z", "commit": {"oid": "dbf918a0f783ae22586efea20ef2b3fc310e4469"}, "state": "DISMISSED", "comments": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wOC0yOFQxNzo0NTo1MlrOHJPSXg==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wOC0yOFQxNzo0Nzo0NlrOHJPVzw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ3OTQ0OTY5NA==", "bodyText": "I still don't understand why this boolean is necessary.
