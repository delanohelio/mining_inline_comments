The primary issue is that all of the elytra code is hard coded to work with item == Items.ELYTRA.\nThis PR aims to resolve this issue by adding a simple interface that can be added to any chest plate item. And because forge allows you specify an EquipmentSlotType for any item this does not have to be an armor item.\nThere have been a few similar PR's in the past. #4958 #4848 #4759 #4476 but none of these got merged so i figured i would take a crack at it.\nMy goal was to make this PR as simple and easy to maintain as possible.\nInitially this was just one interface with two methods and 3 minor changes in vanilla code. Then i realized with just one more minor change i could add the ability to easily use the vanilla elytra model with custom texture support so i added that as well.\nThere are a lot of other features that were covered by the previous pr's such as custom damage handling, velocity handling for things like a \"boost\" function as well as a few other things but all of that can already be done via other means. So instead i chose to just focus on the base issue which is that its not currently possible to add custom elytra type flight.\nThe only real down side to this pr vs something like #4958 is that the interface added by this pr only works when used on an item that goes in the chest plate slot.\nBut i don't think that's to unreasonable.", "createdAt": "2020-06-21T15:34:12Z", "url": "https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/pull/6791", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "a753a3eddce24d39bb3b7bf0e8175772914afdbd"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-09-08T19:07:54Z", "author": {"login": "brandon3055"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 9, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABctlxNtgFqTQzNDU0ODI4Ng==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABc7iF04gFqTQ2MDU5MDY5OQ==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDM0NTQ4Mjg2", "url": "https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/pull/6791#pullrequestreview-434548286", "createdAt": "2020-06-22T00:32:55Z", "commit": {"oid": "2a8287ec664fdb6d4926f93ad39a5dcf54a84665"}, "state": "CHANGES_REQUESTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 0, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": null, "endCursor": null, "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": []}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDM0NjQwNzM4", "url": "https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/pull/6791#pullrequestreview-434640738", "createdAt": "2020-06-22T06:43:24Z", "commit": {"oid": "2a8287ec664fdb6d4926f93ad39a5dcf54a84665"}, "state": "APPROVED", "comments": {"totalCount": 0, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": null, "endCursor": null, "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": []}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDM0NjkxNzk5", "url": "https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/pull/6791#pullrequestreview-434691799", "createdAt": "2020-06-22T08:06:13Z", "commit": {"oid": "2a8287ec664fdb6d4926f93ad39a5dcf54a84665"}, "state": "APPROVED", "comments": {"totalCount": 0, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": null, "endCursor": null, "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": []}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDM0ODA0NjQ3", "url": "https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/pull/6791#pullrequestreview-434804647", "createdAt": "2020-06-22T10:39:55Z", "commit": {"oid": "2a8287ec664fdb6d4926f93ad39a5dcf54a84665"}, "state": "APPROVED", "comments": {"totalCount": 0, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": null, "endCursor": null, "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": []}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDM0ODE2MDIx", "url": "https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/pull/6791#pullrequestreview-434816021", "createdAt": "2020-06-22T10:58:02Z", "commit": {"oid": "2a8287ec664fdb6d4926f93ad39a5dcf54a84665"}, "state": "CHANGES_REQUESTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNi0yMlQxMDo1ODowMlrOGm7x0w==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNi0yMlQxMDo1OToyMlrOGm70bg==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0MzQ3ODQ4Mw==", "bodyText": "This is bad documentation, imho.
