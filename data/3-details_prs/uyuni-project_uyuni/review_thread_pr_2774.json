And in general we would rather want to go away from using velocity, so I would probably not want to introduce this macro for being used in javadoc comments. Therefore I purposely chose to use just \"product administrator\" here, this way it should be valid in the context of Uyuni, but also downstream, while developers hopefully know what is meant (the current SAT_ADMIN aka satellite_admin in the DB).\nAdditionally I had the idea to actually replace satellite_admin throughout the DB and codebase with product_admin (or maybe something else?) to be more generic, while using \"SUSE Manager Administrator\" and \"Uyuni Administrator\" respectively in the UI. If we did this, that comment would not need to be updated, and the code itself would be product name agnostic. I would be curious to know your opinion about that?", "url": "https://github.com/uyuni-project/uyuni/pull/2774#discussion_r517482426", "createdAt": "2020-11-04T16:44:05Z", "author": {"login": "renner"}, "path": "java/code/src/com/redhat/rhn/frontend/xmlrpc/org/OrgHandler.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -314,7 +314,7 @@ private ChannelFamily lookupChannelFamily(String channelFamilyLabel) {\n \n     /**\n      * Migrate systems from one organization to another.
