This PR adds a configuration switch to disable the automatic system locking in rhn.conf.\nBy default, the automatic system locking is enabled.\nIn addition, we switched how CaaSP gets detected. Even by installing the pattern patterns-caasp-Management (that contains skuba but it will not make a node part of the cluster) it will make the product installed on the node marked as CaaSP. Then, we switched the CaaSP node recognition by looking at the installed pattern: patterns-caasp-Node  installed marks a node as part of a CaaSP cluster.\nNOTE: the change above is internal and as such not published into the changelog.\n[1] https://mailman.suse.de/mlarch/SuSE/suse-manager/2020/suse-manager.2020.04/msg00285.html\nGUI diff\nNo difference.\n\n
