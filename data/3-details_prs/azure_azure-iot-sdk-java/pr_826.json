The device client will spawn these threads regardless of if any messages actually need to be sent/received, though.\nWith this change, the send/receive threads will instead wait until a message requires them to wake up. This will cut down on thread creation during less busy times without sacrificing performance during busy times\nThe second commit for this PR makes our DeviceIO layer more responsive to connection change events. Previously, if the transport layer went into reconnecting mode, the device IO layer would still spawn send/receive threads repeatedly even though they would be unable to send/receive anything since the transport isn't connected.", "createdAt": "2020-06-26T18:50:59Z", "url": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-java/pull/826", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid":
