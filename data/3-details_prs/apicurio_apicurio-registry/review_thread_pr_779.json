However, we can control this behavior using the needs keyword. It basically accepts an array where we can specify the job-names. This will prevent the job from running parallelly with other jobs, instead it will wait for the specified jobs to complete and will start running only if the specified jobs have completed successfully.", "url": "https://github.com/Apicurio/apicurio-registry/pull/779#discussion_r473279958", "createdAt": "2020-08-19T19:50:36Z", "author": {"login": "riprasad"}, "path": ".github/workflows/release.yaml", "diffHunk": "@@ -157,3 +157,38 @@ jobs:\n           git add -f _data/registry/releases/$FILENAME.json    #ignored due to .gitignore config\n           git commit -m \"Automated Update For Apicurio Registry Release Version: ${{steps.metadata.outputs.release-version}}\"\n           git push\n+\n+  verify-release:\n+    runs-on: ubuntu-18.04\n+    needs: [\"release\"]   # The Job gets triggered only after the \"release\" job has successfully completed.

We fetch this information from project.yaml. However, the GitHub action that we use to fetch the metadata from the 'project.yaml' file works only with the pull request event. This would mean that the trigger for the workflow must be the pull-request event. Another thing is, on the pull request event, both the release and verify-release workflow will get triggered simultaneously.
