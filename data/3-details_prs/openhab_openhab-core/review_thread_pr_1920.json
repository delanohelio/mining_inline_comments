Note that the rule refresher only kicks in upon changes in items/things/addons to make sure that references in rules are correctly resolved.\nIf people work on rules, those changes are immediately reloaded upon saving the rule, so there is no delay.\nIf they add new items&things (after startup), it is likely that they do not reference those within the rules yet and will rather go and edit the rules later on (for which there won't be a delay).\nSo only if they first created rules with references to stuff that isn't yet defined/installed on their system, the 30 sec delay kicks in and I'd think this should be acceptable, especially when helping on the general startup behavior.", "url": "https://github.com/openhab/openhab-core/pull/1920#discussion_r541890158", "createdAt": "2020-12-13T09:54:48Z", "author": {"login": "kaikreuzer"}, "path": "bundles/org.openhab.core.model.rule/src/org/openhab/core/model/rule/jvmmodel/RulesRefresher.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -56,7 +56,7 @@\n public class RulesRefresher implements ReadyTracker {\n \n     // delay in seconds before rule resources are refreshed after items or services have changed\n-    private static final long REFRESH_DELAY = 5;\n+    private static final long REFRESH_DELAY = 30;", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0MTgwNDUzMQ=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "da33cc44a1e17af1d0de31dcaa52bf4a57058b21"}, "originalPosition": 5}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0MTg5MTg1MA==", "bodyText": "Thanks for the explanation!
