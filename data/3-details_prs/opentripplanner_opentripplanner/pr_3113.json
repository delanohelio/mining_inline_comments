Are all the tests passing on the continuous integration service (Travis CI)?\n formatting: Have you followed the suggested code style?\n documentation: If you are adding a new configuration option, have you added an explanation to the configuration documentation tables and sections?\n changelog: add a bullet point to the changelog file with description and link to the linked issue\n\nTo be completed by @opentripplanner/plc:\n\n reviews and approvals by 2 members, ideally from different organizations\n after merging: update the relevant card on the roadmap\n\nThis changes the TRANSIT_SEARCH_RANGE_IN_DAYS to start counting from today instead of from yesterday. I have also added some documentation, so that we do not misunderstand this again.\nMost deployments will want trips starting yesterday-today-tomorrow included in the search data, and the most likely reason to change it would be in the case of very long search ranges or trips lasting multiple days.", "createdAt": "2020-06-23T11:09:22Z", "url": "https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/pull/3113", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "15a4aa4fd68cd198e32915deded9298944350f94"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-08-20T13:26:16Z", "author": {"login": "gmellemstrand"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 8, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABcs0XWVgH2gAyNDM4NDk3NTgyOjNmYjM0ZTJiNTdlNzA5MjAwMzQ4MmRlZjY0ZWM5MjEzY2Q4NzFiODA=", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABdAr06igFqTQ3MTM2OTQwMQ==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "3fb34e2b57e7092003482def64ec9213cd871b80", "author": {"user": {"login": "gmellemstrand", "name": null}}, "url": "https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/commit/3fb34e2b57e7092003482def64ec9213cd871b80", "committedDate": "2020-06-19T14:59:19Z", "message": "Fix dayRange error and add javadoc"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "b4bb046a1cefeff4e6e4f265e3b6541a22627735", "author": {"user": {"login": "gmellemstrand", "name": null}}, "url": "https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/commit/b4bb046a1cefeff4e6e4f265e3b6541a22627735", "committedDate": "2020-07-22T07:59:41Z", "message": "Merge branch 'dev-2.x' into otp2_daterange_fix"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "43be8bfc4ce85b1180cae521f8fef82ede551495", "author": {"user": {"login": "gmellemstrand", "name": null}}, "url": "https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/commit/43be8bfc4ce85b1180cae521f8fef82ede551495", "committedDate": "2020-08-18T08:20:41Z", "message": "Merge branch 'dev-2.x' into otp2_daterange_fix"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "fc4896af71f03e7b8d4d4bb9298d5de5f48e37dd", "author": {"user": {"login": "gmellemstrand", "name": null}}, "url": "https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/commit/fc4896af71f03e7b8d4d4bb9298d5de5f48e37dd", "committedDate": "2020-08-18T10:58:06Z", "message": "Split dayRange constant into past and future days"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDcwMjQ0MTg4", "url": "https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/pull/3113#pullrequestreview-470244188", "createdAt": "2020-08-19T08:39:00Z", "commit": {"oid": "fc4896af71f03e7b8d4d4bb9298d5de5f48e37dd"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wOC0xOVQwODozOTowMFrOHC9LhA==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wOC0xOVQwODozOTowMFrOHC9LhA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ3Mjg2MTU3Mg==", "bodyText": "The Javadocs and constants are swapped", "url": "https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/pull/3113#discussion_r472861572", "createdAt": "2020-08-19T08:39:00Z", "author": {"login": "hannesj"}, "path": "src/main/java/org/opentripplanner/routing/algorithm/RoutingWorker.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -45,7 +45,22 @@\n public class RoutingWorker {\n     private static final int NOT_SET = -1;\n \n-    private static final int TRANSIT_SEARCH_RANGE_IN_DAYS = 2;\n+    /**\n+     * The numbers of days before the search date to consider when filtering trips for this search.\n+     * This is set to 1 to account for trips starting yesterday and crossing midnight so that they\n+     * can be boarded today.
