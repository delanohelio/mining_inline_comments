Whilst I was trying to understand the code, I added these docstrings. I'd appreciate them being read through for correctness and if there's anything else worth mentioning in them.\nIf you're interested, things that weren't obvious to me when trying to get setup/understand the code were:\n\nWhat version of Android Studio to install (this was pretty quick to realise/sort out)\nWhy there's multiple different Gradle projects and what they all mean (as far as I can tell, most things are in the main app project)\nHow things fit together. In particular, understanding how things like PagerActivity work, what code in what files calls what other code for everything to work. That said, structuring this kind of complex functionality must be hard, so I'm not too surprised it's hard to understand. But I think it was also kind of getting a high-level understanding of how the different files/classes relate to each other (I probably should have just used one of those tools that shows the dependencies between classes, would have probably made things simpler for me).\n\nAfter this PR, I was thinking of maybe trying to get #458 sorted, as it seems to have languished a bit.", "createdAt": "2020-02-29T16:24:02Z", "url": "https://github.com/quran/quran_android/pull/1288", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "357b4933062ceffd436115448b762e5a2e6f49f5"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-03-01T21:15:09Z", "author": {"login": "ismail-s"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABcJG5MTAH2gAyMzgxODc1Nzk1OjU5NTlmZTU1MWUwOWJkZmNiMzg0YmExYjk3OGQzZjc4MDA0YzdkYzU=", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABcJU6GpAFqTM2Njg0Mjg2NA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "5959fe551e09bdfcb384ba1b978d3f78004c7dc5", "author": {"user": {"login": "ismail-s", "name": "Ismail S"}}, "url": "https://github.com/quran/quran_android/commit/5959fe551e09bdfcb384ba1b978d3f78004c7dc5", "committedDate": "2020-02-29T16:13:18Z", "message": "Add some docstrings"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3MzY2ODQyODY0", "url": "https://github.com/quran/quran_android/pull/1288#pullrequestreview-366842864", "createdAt": "2020-03-01T08:29:29Z", "commit": {"oid": "5959fe551e09bdfcb384ba1b978d3f78004c7dc5"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMy0wMVQwODoyOToyOVrOFwM7pw==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wMy0wMVQwODoyOToyOVrOFwM7pw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4NjA4Nzg0Nw==", "bodyText": "Why not link them too?", "url": "https://github.com/quran/quran_android/pull/1288#discussion_r386087847", "createdAt": "2020-03-01T08:29:29Z", "author": {"login": "ozbek"}, "path": "app/src/main/java/com/quran/labs/androidquran/ui/QuranActivity.kt", "diffHunk": "@@ -55,6 +55,20 @@ import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS\n import javax.inject.Inject\n import kotlin.math.abs\n \n+/**\n+ * The home screen activity for the app. Displays a toolbar and 3 fragments:\n+ *\n+ *  * [SuraListFragment]", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "5959fe551e09bdfcb384ba1b978d3f78004c7dc5"}, "originalPosition": 7}]}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 3061, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-01T16:37:27Z"}}}
