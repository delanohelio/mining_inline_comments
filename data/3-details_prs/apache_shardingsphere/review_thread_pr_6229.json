TCC provides a more perfect recovery method with the help of a two-phase submission agreement. In TCC mode, cancel compensation obviously needs to execute business logic in the second stage to cancel the consequences of the first stage. Try is to perform related business operations in the first stage to complete the occupation of related business resources, such as pre-allocating ticket resources, or checking and refreshing the user account credit limit. During the cancellation phase, relevant business resources are released, such as releasing pre-allocated ticketing resources or restoring previously occupied user credits. Why do we need to add confirmation operations? This needs to start with the use life cycle of business resources. In the try process, we are only occupying business resources, and the related execution operations are only in a pending state. Only after the confirmation operation is completed, the business resources can be truly confirmed.\n+\n+The strong consistency transaction based on ACID and the final consistency transaction based on BASE are not silver bullets, and their greatest strengths can only be used in the most suitable scenarios.
