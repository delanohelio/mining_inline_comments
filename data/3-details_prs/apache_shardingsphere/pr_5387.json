Business parties need to perform JDBC programming for Encrypt-JDBC. Since Encrypt-JDBC implements all JDBC standard interfaces, business codes can be used without additional modification. At this time, Encrypt-JDBC is responsible for all interactions between the business code and the database. Business only needs to provide encryption rules. ** As a bridge between the business code and the underlying database, Encrypt-JDBC can intercept user behavior and interact with the database after transforming the user behavior. **", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "887444092053a140b40b0a74be61833d45834aa8"}, "originalPosition": 28}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "23853473bbfa9d45181a1d81a6897cffb6139201", "author": {"user": {"login": "taojintianxia", "name": "\u5b59\u5ff5\u541b Sun Nianjun"}}, "url": "https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/commit/23853473bbfa9d45181a1d81a6897cffb6139201", "committedDate": "2020-04-30T16:30:51Z", "message": "fix the issue as suggestion"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDAzOTgxMTA0", "url": "https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pull/5387#pullrequestreview-403981104", "createdAt": "2020-05-01T01:35:49Z", "commit": {"oid": "23853473bbfa9d45181a1d81a6897cffb6139201"}, "state": "APPROVED", "comments": {"totalCount": 0, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": null, "endCursor": null, "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": []}}]}}}, "rateLimit": {"limit": 5000, "remaining": 3629, "cost": 1, "resetAt": "2021-11-01T11:59:11Z"}}}
