The goal of this design is to ensure the ACID semantics of transactions after data fragmentation. The realization of distributed transactions mainly includes 2PC XA and BASE transaction. As an implementation of BASE transaction, Seata AT transaction can be seamlessly connected to the ShardingSphere ecosystem.\n+\n+![](https://shardingsphere.apache.org/blog/img/seata2.jpg)\n+\n+For 2PC XA transaction, we have integrated Atomikos, Narayana, Bitronix transaction mangers, \n+The bottom layer of XA transaction depends on the support of specific database vendors for the 2PC XA commit protocol, usually XA protocol doing 2PL (2 phase Lock) throughout Prepare and Commit which guarantees the ACID of distributed transactions. This usually suitable for short transaction and non-cloud environments (cloud environment takes around 20ms to do next IO, 2PL will lock resources up to 40ms, so the TPS of transaction will goes down to 25/s, non-cloud environment usually only takes a few milliseconds per IO, therefore the time to lock data is relatively low) \\[1\\].\n+\n+In terms of BASE transactions, we have now completed the integration of ServiceComb Saga. Saga has improved the performance of the overall transaction through one-phase commit plus compensation. The compensation method is roughly the same as Seata, that is, the physical SQL after fragmentation Revert is used to generate compensated SQL, but the Saga model does not support isolation levels in theory, and is suitable for businesses with high performance requirements and low consistency requirements. On the basis of one-phase commit plus compensation, Seata AT transaction supports the RC isolation level through the global lock of TC, which is another implementation between XA and Saga. In terms of flexible news affairs, you are also welcome to refer to our SPI to provide integrated solutions.\n+### Integrated solution\n+\n+When integrating Seata AT transactions, we need to integrate TM, RM and TC models into the ShardingSphere distributed transaction SPI ecosystem. For database resource, Seata allows JDBC operations to communicate with TC through RPC by docking with DataSource interface. Similarly, ShardingSphere also integrate physical DataSource that configured by the user into DataSource interface. Therefore, after the physical DataSource is repacked as Seata\u2019s DataSource, Seata AT transactions can be integrated into ShardingSphere\u2019s Shards. \n+\n+In the model of Seata, the context of global transaction is stored in thread variable, the transfer between thread variables can be completed by extending the transport between services, branch transaction determines whether or not join in entire Seata global transaction by thread variable.
