As Azure has matured and been embraced by a more diverse group of developers, we have been focused on learning the patterns and practices to best support developer productivity and to understand the gaps that the Java client libraries have.\n+\n+There were several areas of consistent feedback expressed across the Azure client library ecosystem. One of the most important is that the client libraries for different Azure services have not had a consistent approach to organization, naming, and API structure. Additionally, many developers have felt that the learning curve was difficult, and the APIs did not offer a good, approachable, and consistent onboarding story for those learning Azure or exploring a specific Azure service.\n+\n+To try and improve the development experience across Azure services, a set of uniform [design guidelines](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/general_introduction.html) was created for all languages to drive a consistent experience with established API patterns for all services. A set of [Java-specific guidelines](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/java_introduction.html) was also introduced to ensure that Java clients have a natural and idiomatic feel with respect to the Java ecosystem. Further details are available in the guidelines for those interested.\n+\n+### Cross Service SDK improvements\n+The modern Key Vault Key client library also provides the ability to share in some of the cross-service improvements made to the Azure development experience, such as:\n+\n+- Using the new Azure Identity library to share a single authentication approach between clients.\n+- A unified logging and diagnostics pipeline offering a common view of the activities across each of the client libraries.\n+\n+## Important changes\n+### Separate packages and clients\n+In the interest of simplifying the API, `azure-keyvault` and `KeyVaultClient` were split into separate packages and clients:\n+\n+- [`azure-security-keyvault-certificates`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/master/sdk/keyvault/azure-security-keyvault-certificates/README.md) contains `CertificateClient` for working with certificates.\n+- `azure-security-keyvault-keys` contains `KeyClient` for working with keys and `CryptographyClient` for performing cryptographic operations.\n+- [`azure-security-keyvault-secrets`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/master/sdk/keyvault/azure-security-keyvault-secrets/README.md) contains `SecretClient` for working with secrets.\n+\n+### Package names and namespaces\n+Package names and the namespace root for the modern Azure client libraries for Java have changed. Each will follow the pattern `com.azure.<area>.<service>` where the legacy clients followed the pattern `com.microsoft.azure.<service>`. This provides a quick and accessible means to help understand, at a glance, whether you are using the modern or legacy clients.\n+\n+In the case of the Key Vault, the modern client libraries have packages and namespaces that begin with `com.azure.security.keyvault` and were released beginning with version `4.0.0`. The legacy client libraries have packages and namespaces that begin with `com.microsoft.azure.keyvault` and a version of `1.x.x` or below.\n+\n+### Client constructors\n+Across all modern Azure client libraries, clients consistently take an endpoint or connection string along with token credentials. This differs from `KeyVaultClient`, which took an authentication delegate and could be used for multiple Key Vault endpoints.\n+\n+### Authentication\n+Previously in `azure-keyvault` you could create a `KeyVaultClient` by passing either a `KeyVaultCredential` or `RestClient` from `client-runtime`:\n+\n+```java\n+import com.microsoft.azure.keyvault.KeyVaultClient;\n+import com.microsoft.azure.keyvault.authentication.KeyVaultCredentials;\n+\n+KeyVaultCredentials keyVaultCredentials = new MyKeyVaultCredentials(\"<client-id>\", \"<client-key>\");\n+KeyVaultClient keyVaultClient = new KeyVaultClient(keyVaultCredentials);\n+```\n+\n+Now in `azure-security-keyvault-keys` you can create a `KeyClient` using any credential from [`azure-identity`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/master/sdk/identity/azure-identity/README.md).
