From a developer's perspective, Key Vault APIs accept and return secret values as strings. In addition to the secret data, the following attributes may be specified:\n-* expires: Identifies the expiration time on or after which the secret data should not be retrieved.\n-* notBefore: Identifies the time after which the secret will be active.\n+A secret is the fundamental resource within Azure Key Vault. From a developer's perspective, Key Vault APIs accept and return secret values as strings. In addition to the secret data, the following attributes may be specified:\n * enabled: Specifies whether the secret data can be retrieved.\n+* notBefore: Identifies the time after which the secret will be active.\n+* expires: Identifies the expiration time on or after which the secret data should not be retrieved.\n * created: Indicates when this version of the secret was created.\n * updated: Indicates when this version of the secret was updated.\n \n-### Secret Client:\n-The Secret client performs the interactions with the Azure Key Vault service for getting, setting, updating, deleting, and listing secrets and its versions. An asynchronous and synchronous, SecretClient, client exists in the SDK allowing for selection of a client based on an application's use case. Once you've initialized a SecretClient, you can interact with the primary resource types in Key Vault.\n+### Secret client:\n+The secret client performs the interactions with the Azure Key Vault service for getting, setting, updating, deleting, and listing secrets and its versions.
