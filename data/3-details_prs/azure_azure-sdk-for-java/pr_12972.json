While providing FileSystem APIs on top of Azure Blob \n+Storage can offer convenience and ease of access in certain cases, trying to force the Storage service to work in \n+scenarios it is not designed for is bound to introduce performance and stability problems. \n+\n+To that end, this project will only offer APIs that can be sensibly and cleanly built on top of Azure Blob Storage APIs. \n+We recognize that this will leave some scenarios unsupported indefinitely, but we would rather offer a product that \n+works predictably and reliably in its well defined scenarios than eagerly support all possible scenarios at the expense \n+of quality. Even still, supporting some fundamentally required use cases, such as directories, can result in unexpected \n+behavior due to the difference between blob storage and a file system. The javadocs on each type and method should\n+therefore be read and understood for ways in which they may diverge from the standard specified by the JDK. \n+\n+Moreover, even from within a given application, it should be remembered that using a remote FileSystem introduces higher \n+latency. Because of this, particular care must be taken when managing concurrency. Race conditions are more likely to \n+manifest, network failures occur more frequently than disk failures, and other such distributed application scenarios \n+must be considered when working with this FileSystem. While the AzureFileSystem will ensure it takes appropriate steps \n+towards robustness and reliability, the application developer must also design around these failure scenarios and have \n+fallback and retry options available.\n+\n+The view of the FileSystem from within an instance of the JVM will be consistent, but the AzureFileSystem makes no \n+guarantees on behavior or state should other processes operate on the same data. The AzureFileSystem will assume that it \n+has exclusive access to the resources stored in Azure Blob Storage and will behave without regard for potential \n+interfering applications\n+\n+Finally, this implementation has currently chosen to always read/write directly to/from Azure Storage without a local \n+cache. Our team has determined that with the tradeoffs of complexity, correctness, safety, performance, debuggability, \n+etc. one option is not inherently better than the other and that this choice most directly addresses the current known\n+use cases for this project. While this has consequences for every API, of particular note is the limitations on writing\n+data. Data may only be written as an entire file (i.e. random IO or appends are not supported), and data is not \n+committed or available to be read until the write stream is closed. \n \n-1.
