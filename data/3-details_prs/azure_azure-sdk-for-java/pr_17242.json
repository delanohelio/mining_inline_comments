This \n+  also supports working with sessions where you can provide the maximum number of sessions to work with concurrently. \n+  When the client no longer receives any messages from one session, it rolls over to the next available session.\n+- Added `BinaryData` in `ServiceBusReceivedMessage` and `ServiceBusMessage`. `BinaryData` is convenience wrapper over\n+  byte array and provides object serialization functionality.\n+- Added `ServicebusReceiverException` and `ServiceBusErrorSource` to provide better handling of errors while receiving \n+  messages.\n \n+### Breaking Changes\n+- Changed `receiveMessages` API to return `ServiceBusReceivedMessage` instead of ServiceBusReceivedMessageContext in \n+  `ServiceBusReceiverAsynClient` and `ServiceBusReceiverClient`.\n+- Removed `SendVia` option from `ServiceBusClientBuilder`. See issue for more detail \n+  [16942](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/16942).\n+- Removed `sessionId` setting from `ServiceBusSessionReceiverClientBuilder` to the intermediate clients.\n+- Moved the `maxConcurrentSessions` setting from `ServiceBusSessionReceiverClientBuilder` to \n+  ServiceBusSessionProcessorClientBuilder` as the feature of receiving messages from multiple sessions is moved from the\n+  receiver client to the new `ServiceBusSessionProcessorClient`.\n+- `ServiceBusSessionReceiverClient` and `ServiceBusSessionReceiverAsyncClient` now have methods that would take the \n+  sessionId to get a receiver client bound to the session.\n+- Renamed `tryAdd` to `tryAddMessage` in `ServiceBusMessageBatch`.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "c6fd8013e65df719b31e6396f7380b1a10a02837"}, "originalPosition": 33}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "f1e60d37c69e6c5d781165ab9a88a182503188f8", "author": {"user": null}, "url": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/commit/f1e60d37c69e6c5d781165ab9a88a182503188f8", "committedDate": "2020-11-06T20:13:30Z", "message": "updating core amqp pom filw with current beta version"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "bef62b5f8f70c4455d2e4a4ab7a8dc1df0866c82", "author": {"user": null}, "url": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/commit/bef62b5f8f70c4455d2e4a4ab7a8dc1df0866c82", "committedDate": "2020-11-06T20:20:27Z", "message": "more updates to change log"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "2d39a6c1e15b937555cd4cf304a1710c9e7cf85f", "author": {"user": null}, "url": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/commit/2d39a6c1e15b937555cd4cf304a1710c9e7cf85f", "committedDate": "2020-11-06T20:29:04Z", "message": "more updates change log"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "723287868b7cfbeb9efdec85b847c42dda604ebc", "author": {"user": null}, "url": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/commit/723287868b7cfbeb9efdec85b847c42dda604ebc", "committedDate": "2020-11-06T20:32:46Z", "message": "pom file change for dependency"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NTI1NDc5NjE0", "url": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/17242#pullrequestreview-525479614", "createdAt": "2020-11-06T20:40:51Z", "commit": {"oid": "723287868b7cfbeb9efdec85b847c42dda604ebc"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0wNlQyMDo0MDo1MVrOHu85GA==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0wNlQyMDo0MDo1MVrOHu85GA==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxODk5NDIwMA==", "bodyText": "I'm curious why we are bumping this number here?\nDid we release beta-1 already?", "url": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/17242#discussion_r518994200", "createdAt": "2020-11-06T20:40:51Z", "author": {"login": "conniey"}, "path": "eng/versioning/version_client.txt", "diffHunk": "@@ -35,7 +35,7 @@ com.azure:azure-communication-common;1.0.0-beta.2;1.0.0-beta.3\n com.azure:azure-communication-administration;1.0.0-beta.2;1.0.0-beta.3\n com.azure:azure-communication-sms;1.0.0-beta.2;1.0.0-beta.3\n com.azure:azure-core;1.10.0;1.11.0-beta.1\n-com.azure:azure-core-amqp;1.6.0;1.7.0-beta.1\n+com.azure:azure-core-amqp;1.6.0;1.7.0-beta.2", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "723287868b7cfbeb9efdec85b847c42dda604ebc"}, "originalPosition": 5}]}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NTI1NDgxNTI1", "url": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/17242#pullrequestreview-525481525", "createdAt": "2020-11-06T20:44:14Z", "commit": {"oid": "723287868b7cfbeb9efdec85b847c42dda604ebc"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0wNlQyMDo0NDoxNFrOHu8-uw==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0wNlQyMDo0NDoxNFrOHu8-uw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxODk5NTY0Mw==", "bodyText": "Is beta.8 released?
