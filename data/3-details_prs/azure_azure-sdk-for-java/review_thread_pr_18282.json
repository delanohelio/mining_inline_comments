Each will follow the pattern `com.azure.<area>.<service>` where the legacy clients followed the pattern `com.microsoft.azure.<service>`. This provides a quick and accessible means to help understand, at a glance, whether you are using the modern or legacy clients.\n+\n+In the case of the Key Vault, the modern client libraries have packages and namespaces that begin with `com.azure.security.keyvault` and were released beginning with version `4.0.0`. The legacy client libraries have packages and namespaces that begin with `com.microsoft.azure.keyvault` and a version of `1.x.x` or below.\n+\n+### Client constructors\n+Across all modern Azure client libraries, clients consistently take an endpoint or connection string along with token credentials. This differs from `KeyVaultClient`, which took an authentication delegate and could be used for multiple Key Vault endpoints.\n+\n+### Authentication\n+Previously in `azure-keyvault` you could create a `KeyVaultClient` by passing either a `KeyVaultCredential` or `RestClient` from `client-runtime`:\n+\n+```java\n+import com.microsoft.azure.keyvault.KeyVaultClient;\n+import com.microsoft.azure.keyvault.authentication.KeyVaultCredentials;\n+\n+KeyVaultCredentials keyVaultCredentials = new MyKeyVaultCredentials(\"<client-id>\", \"<client-key>\");\n+KeyVaultClient keyVaultClient = new KeyVaultClient(keyVaultCredentials);\n+```\n+\n+Now in `azure-security-keyvault-keys` you can create a `KeyClient` using any credential from [`azure-identity`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/master/sdk/identity/azure-identity/README.md).
