The correct path to the parent pom should be: ../../parents/azure-data-sdk-parent\nQ. What does this mean?\nA. This means that it would have been pulling the parent pom from Maven. The difference between what is in the tree versus what is in Maven are as follows:\n\nThe version of com.puppycrawl.tools:checkstyle defined in the pom on Maven is 8.24 instead of 8.29. Though it's effective pom was pulling in 8.29 and only 8.29. Also verified by cleaning my .m2, building and this was the only checkstyle version.\nThere is some surfire plugin configuration that was setting a keyvault URI for testing only in source tree.\nThere were minor changes to remove profiles for the non-shipping modules and the azure-sdk-template libraries in the source.\nThe modules list at the bottom of the file has since been removed in the source tree.\n\nThere's nothing here I found as cause for concern.", "createdAt": "2020-05-18T20:11:07Z", "url": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/11258", "merged": true, "mergeCommit": {"oid": "b30349f051eff6002618689574f1ab85f35f9968"}, "closed": true, "closedAt": "2020-05-18T21:27:08Z", "author": {"login": "JimSuplizio"}, "timelineItems": {"totalCount": 4, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABcikg0OAH2gAyNDE5NzE2ODY4OmQ3MmJlZWNkZmFlMDE4MDQyYTAwYmM5MWU1NmU5YTc5YTY2ZmFjMWE=", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpPPAAABcimuR7gFqTQxMzk1MDM3MQ==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "d72beecdfae018042a00bc91e56e9a79a66fac1a", "author": {"user": {"login": "JimSuplizio", "name": "James Suplizio"}}, "url": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/commit/d72beecdfae018042a00bc91e56e9a79a66fac1a", "committedDate": "2020-05-18T18:51:56Z", "message": "Update relativePath to azure-data-sdk-parent pom"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDEzOTA3MTYy", "url": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/11258#pullrequestreview-413907162", "createdAt": "2020-05-18T20:13:10Z", "commit": {"oid": "d72beecdfae018042a00bc91e56e9a79a66fac1a"}, "state": "APPROVED", "comments": {"totalCount": 0, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": null, "endCursor": null, "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": []}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestCommit", "commit": {"oid": "2433615015e5948ca42f8e9854a4d597d1e3c89a", "author": {"user": {"login": "JimSuplizio", "name": "James Suplizio"}}, "url": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/commit/2433615015e5948ca42f8e9854a4d597d1e3c89a", "committedDate": "2020-05-18T20:44:22Z", "message": "Move the plugin configuration into pluginManagement from reporting"}}, {"__typename": "PullRequestReview", "id": "MDE3OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3NDEzOTUwMzcx", "url": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/11258#pullrequestreview-413950371", "createdAt": "2020-05-18T21:26:26Z", "commit": {"oid": "2433615015e5948ca42f8e9854a4d597d1e3c89a"}, "state": "COMMENTED", "comments": {"totalCount": 1, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNS0xOFQyMToyNjoyN1rOGXICKQ==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0wNS0xOFQyMToyNjoyN1rOGXICKQ==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyNjkwMjA1Nw==", "bodyText": "@vcolin7 - So you're aware of why this particular change, in the second commit, was necessary. When this was changed back in April it was moved under the reporting instead of the pluginManagement.
