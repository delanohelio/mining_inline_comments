This \n+  also supports working with sessions where you can provide the maximum number of sessions to work with concurrently. \n+  When the client no longer receives any messages from one session, it rolls over to the next available session.\n+- Added `BinaryData` in `ServiceBusReceivedMessage` and `ServiceBusMessage`. `BinaryData` is convenience wrapper over\n+  byte array and provides object serialization functionality.\n+- Added `ServicebusReceiverException` and `ServiceBusErrorSource` to provide better handling of errors while receiving \n+  messages.\n \n+### Breaking Changes\n+- Changed `receiveMessages` API to return `ServiceBusReceivedMessage` instead of ServiceBusReceivedMessageContext in \n+  `ServiceBusReceiverAsynClient` and `ServiceBusReceiverClient`.\n+- Removed `SendVia` option from `ServiceBusClientBuilder`. See issue for more detail \n+  [16942](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/16942).\n+- Removed `sessionId` setting from `ServiceBusSessionReceiverClientBuilder` to the intermediate clients.\n+- Moved the `maxConcurrentSessions` setting from `ServiceBusSessionReceiverClientBuilder` to \n+  ServiceBusSessionProcessorClientBuilder` as the feature of receiving messages from multiple sessions is moved from the\n+  receiver client to the new `ServiceBusSessionProcessorClient`.\n+- `ServiceBusSessionReceiverClient` and `ServiceBusSessionReceiverAsyncClient` now have methods that would take the \n+  sessionId to get a receiver client bound to the session.\n+- Renamed `tryAdd` to `tryAddMessage` in `ServiceBusMessageBatch`.", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "c6fd8013e65df719b31e6396f7380b1a10a02837"}, "originalPosition": 33}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMzI1MzAyMzY5OnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "eng/versioning/version_client.txt", "isResolved": false, "comments": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0wNlQyMDo0MDo1MVrOHu85GA==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0wNlQyMDo0ODoyMFrOHu9Fuw==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxODk5NDIwMA==", "bodyText": "I'm curious why we are bumping this number here?\nDid we release beta-1 already?", "url": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/17242#discussion_r518994200", "createdAt": "2020-11-06T20:40:51Z", "author": {"login": "conniey"}, "path": "eng/versioning/version_client.txt", "diffHunk": "@@ -35,7 +35,7 @@ com.azure:azure-communication-common;1.0.0-beta.2;1.0.0-beta.3\n com.azure:azure-communication-administration;1.0.0-beta.2;1.0.0-beta.3\n com.azure:azure-communication-sms;1.0.0-beta.2;1.0.0-beta.3\n com.azure:azure-core;1.10.0;1.11.0-beta.1\n-com.azure:azure-core-amqp;1.6.0;1.7.0-beta.1\n+com.azure:azure-core-amqp;1.6.0;1.7.0-beta.2", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": null, "originalCommit": {"oid": "723287868b7cfbeb9efdec85b847c42dda604ebc"}, "originalPosition": 5}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxODk5NzQzNQ==", "bodyText": "yes https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.azure/azure-core-amqp/1.7.0-beta.1/jar", "url": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/17242#discussion_r518997435", "createdAt": "2020-11-06T20:48:20Z", "author": {"login": "hemanttanwar"}, "path": "eng/versioning/version_client.txt", "diffHunk": "@@ -35,7 +35,7 @@ com.azure:azure-communication-common;1.0.0-beta.2;1.0.0-beta.3\n com.azure:azure-communication-administration;1.0.0-beta.2;1.0.0-beta.3\n com.azure:azure-communication-sms;1.0.0-beta.2;1.0.0-beta.3\n com.azure:azure-core;1.10.0;1.11.0-beta.1\n-com.azure:azure-core-amqp;1.6.0;1.7.0-beta.1\n+com.azure:azure-core-amqp;1.6.0;1.7.0-beta.2", "state": "SUBMITTED", "replyTo": {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxODk5NDIwMA=="}, "originalCommit": {"oid": "723287868b7cfbeb9efdec85b847c42dda604ebc"}, "originalPosition": 5}]}}, {"id": "MDIzOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3VGhyZWFkMzI1MzAzMzE0OnYy", "diffSide": "RIGHT", "path": "sdk/servicebus/azure-messaging-servicebus/pom.xml", "isResolved": false, "comments": {"totalCount": 2, "pageInfo": {"startCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0wNlQyMDo0NDoxNFrOHu8-uw==", "endCursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK0MjAyMC0xMS0wNlQyMDo0OTowN1rOHu9HAg==", "hasNextPage": false, "hasPreviousPage": false}, "nodes": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxODk5NTY0Mw==", "bodyText": "Is beta.8 released?
