Finally, for a quick guide on how to build an end-to-end Azure Digital Twins solution that is driven by live data from your environment, make sure you check out [this helpful guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/digital-twins/tutorial-end-to-end).\n+\n+The guides mentioned above can help you get started with key elements of Azure Digital Twins, such as creating Azure Digital Twins instances, models, twin graphs, etc. Use this samples guide below to familiarize yourself with the various APIs that help you program against Azure Digital Twins.\n+\n+# Digital Twins Samples\n+\n+You can explore the digital twins APIs (using the client library) using the samples project.\n+\n+The samples project demonstrates the following:\n+\n+- Instantiate the client\n+- Create, get, and decommission models\n+- Create, query, and delete a digital twin\n+- Get and update components for a digital twin\n+- Create, get, and delete relationships between digital twins\n+- Create, get, and delete event routes for digital twin\n+- Publish telemetry messages to a digital twin and digital twin component\n+\n+## sync vs async clients\n+\n+Azure DigitalTwins SDK for java has two sets of APIs available for every operation, sync APIs and async APIs.\n+\n+You can use `DigitalTwinsClientbuilder` to build either a sync client: `buildClient()` or an async client: `buildAsyncClient()`.\n+\n+While using the sync client, the running thread will be blocked by the SDK for the duration of the HTTP request/response.\n+The async client is implemented using [Reactor](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/). The rest of this document assumes the reader has basic understanding of Reactor and how to interact with async API response types.\n+\n+## Creating the digital twins client\n+\n+To create a new digital twins client, you need the endpoint to an Azure Digital Twin instance and credentials.\n+In the sample below, you can set `AdtEndpoint`, `TenantId`, `ClientId`, and `ClientSecret` as command-line arguments.\n+The client requires an instance of [TokenCredential](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/java/api/com.azure.core.credential.tokencredential?view=azure-java-stable).\n+In this samples, we illustrate how to use one derived class: ClientSecretCredential.\n+\n+> Note: In order to access the data plane for the Digital Twins service, the entity must be given permissions.\n+> To do this, use the Azure CLI command: `az dt rbac assign-role --assignee '<user-email | application-id>' --role owner -n '<your-digital-twins-instance>'`\n+\n+### Building the sync client\n+\n+```java\n+client = new DigitalTwinsClientBuilder()\n+    .credential(\n+        new ClientSecretCredentialBuilder()\n+            .tenantId(<your-tenantId>)\n+            .clientId(<your-clientId>)\n+            .clientSecret(<your-clientSecret>)\n+            .build()\n+    )\n+    .endpoint(<your-AdtEndpoint>)\n+    .buildClient();\n+```\n+\n+### Building the async client\n+\n+You can use the same client builder and build the async client:\n+\n+```java\n+client = new DigitalTwinsClientBuilder()\n+    .credential(\n+        new ClientSecretCredentialBuilder()\n+            .tenantId(<your-tenantId>)\n+            .clientId(<your-clientId>)\n+            .clientSecret(<your-clientSecret>)\n+            .build()\n+    )\n+    .endpoint(<your-AdtEndpoint>)\n+    .buildAsyncClient();\n+```\n+\n+Also, if you need to override pipeline behavior, such as provide your own HttpClient instance, you can do that via the other setters in the DigitalTwinsClientBuilder instance.\n+\n+For example if you would like to use your own instance of `HttpClient`:\n+\n+```java\n+client = new DigitalTwinsClientBuilder()\n+    .credential(\n+        new ClientSecretCredentialBuilder()\n+            .tenantId(<your-tenantId>)\n+            .clientId(<your-clientId>)\n+            .clientSecret(<your-clientSecret>)\n+            .build()\n+    )\n+    .endpoint(<your-AdtEndpoint>)\n+    .httpClient(<your-http-client>)\n+    .buildAsyncClient();\n+```\n+\n+It provides an opportunity to override default behavior including:\n+\n+- Specifying API version\n+- Overriding [HttpPipeline](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/master/sdk/core/azure-core/src/main/java/com/azure/core/http/HttpPipeline.java).\n+- Enabling [HttpLogOptions](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/master/sdk/core/azure-core/src/main/java/com/azure/core/http/policy/HttpLogOptions.java).\n+- Controlling [retry strategy](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/master/sdk/core/azure-core/src/main/java/com/azure/core/http/policy/RetryPolicy.java).\n+\n+## Working with Response types\n+\n+Both sync and async clients have maximal overloads for getting the Http response along with the return type.
