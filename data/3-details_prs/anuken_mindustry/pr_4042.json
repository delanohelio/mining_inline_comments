friend only?\nNot all players will play normally. griefers, kick command abuse...\nThis affects all users on that server.\nBut what if the user who first played the game gets into the steam server?\nMost of them will be kicked out or ban as soon as they connect.\nEven though players not doing anything.\nSo most users play the server on community servers..\nI hope this resolves the server problem, but unfortunately, most community servers require authentication.\nBecause it's easy to cheating and too many griefers.\nso why need this?\nThis's a problem that has been around since the launch of Steam.\n\nIt seemed to have been resolved by floating a public host check popup, but I understand that almost all players can't do it with friends unless they press YES.\n\nI've seen a lot of servers that abuse kick and bans today, and to solve this, I fundamentally changed the sequence of buttons and created a double popup to solve the yes man.", "createdAt": "2020-12-19T13:13:49Z",
