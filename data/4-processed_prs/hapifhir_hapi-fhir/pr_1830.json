But increasingly we're using these structures for all kinds of other stuff (e.g. in memory matching, reusing rows in the index tables rather than deleting one and adding a new one, etc.) and this haphazard logic was causing unexpected bugs when unpredicted situations arose (such as a stored row having no hash, whcih is the actual thing we're fixing here).\nWhat this change does, more importantly, is remove chance from the equation by just explicitly calcuating the hashes as soon as possible.", "author": "jamesagnew", "createdAt": "2020-05-05T15:00:20Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyMDE3MDA3OQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyMDE5MDQzNw==", "url": "https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir/pull/1830#discussion_r420190437", "bodyText": "nice", "author": "fil512", "createdAt": "2020-05-05T15:16:59Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyMDE3MDA3OQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}]}
