I wonder, for example, what is the behavior of the rule if you write\nimport java.io.*;\npublic class Foo {\n    public int bar() throws IOException {\n        var inputStream = getInputStreamFromSomewhere();\n        char c = reader.read();\n        return c;\n    }\n\n    InputStream getInputStreamFromSomewhere() { return null; }\n}\nNormally, it should be exactly the same behavior as if var was explicitly written, right? In that case, I'm not sure the rule accounts for that, given we test the ASTType node, not VariableDeclaratorId::getType (which is the type of the var). (Note: since we do that, we are probably failing if the var is declared like InputStream streamArray[])\nI think it would make more sense to test VariableDeclaratorId::getType, though I don't know how that interacts with existing tests", "author": "oowekyala", "createdAt": "2020-09-19T14:24:13Z", "path": "pmd-java/src/main/java/net/sourceforge/pmd/lang/java/rule/errorprone/CloseResourceRule.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -175,7 +175,7 @@ private void checkForResources(ASTMethodOrConstructorDeclaration methodOrConstru\n         Map<ASTVariableDeclarator, TypeNode> resVars = new HashMap<>();\n         for (ASTVariableDeclarator var : vars) {\n             TypeNode varType = getTypeOfVariable(var);\n-            if (isResourceTypeOrSubtype(varType)) {\n+            if (varType != null && isResourceTypeOrSubtype(varType)) {", "originalCommit": "81a72cb43ef77f920732a4db80a7885e129e6a67", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5MTc0MzA0Ng==", "url": "https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/2790#discussion_r491743046", "bodyText": "I was passing by and wanted to ask how is it possible to get var Type in PMD?
