It's part of the project, whether it is used for tests or not, doesn't matter. Therefore the file should have the same license as the project...\nWe maybe should add license headers to the other files as well, but that's not a big priority.\nThat these files now pop up for kotlin is a side effect of using checkstyle for linting kotlin.
