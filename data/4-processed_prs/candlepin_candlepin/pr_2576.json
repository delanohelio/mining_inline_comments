Whether or not we even need to bulk fetch early now since we're fetching it through the model rather than the hitting the DB every time is up for debate, and would come down to whether or not the product lookup on pools is lazy and if it needs to be populated at call time.\nAnyway, if we still end up wanting to keep this bulk behavior, there's no need to break it up into two virtually-identical methods when we don't use them independently. This should be merged into one method that either populates two maps, or returns an array of maps or something.
