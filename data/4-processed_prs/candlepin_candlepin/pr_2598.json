And the fact that we had set allowMissingThrowsTags to true tells me we did not care about declaring @throws tags in method javadoc anyway, so I assumed we still don't.\nIf you think we should check every method that throws an exception must declare it in the javadoc (at least in main, not test), then I can get those changes in here.", "author": "nikosmoum", "createdAt": "2020-02-03T15:41:49Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3NDE2MDE1Nw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3NDE3NzEwOA==", "url": "https://github.com/candlepin/candlepin/pull/2598#discussion_r374177108", "bodyText": "Nope, that's fine by me.
