We've had issues in the past with race conditions where the connection would close and cause various exceptions when the stream is processed. I would have to dip into the git history to give you concrete examples.\nNested objects straight up fail in many cases. This was the driving feature here that caused the CandlepinQueryInterceptor to start using its own connection.\n\nI think the long-term goal is to remove CPQ entirely and start using properly designed streams, but that is not something we're willing/able to address in these PRs. For the immediate term, we can move into the spec-first world by setting the container type to be Iterable, but then returning the CandlepinQuery as-is and letting the interceptor pick it up and process it safely. We can even leverage Java's covariant return typing to let the generated API interface define it as an Iterable, but our class define it as a CandlepinQuery as it does today.", "author": "Ceiu", "createdAt": "2020-01-24T20:49:31Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3MDE5MTQ0OA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3MTA1ODk1Mw==", "url": "https://github.com/candlepin/candlepin/pull/2577#discussion_r371058953", "bodyText": "Thanks @Ceiu for details.", "author": "abhiskum", "createdAt": "2020-01-27T04:01:53Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3MDE5MTQ0OA=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "5db093f06a4753aa43596594a373087f3aa92d15", "url": "https://github.com/candlepin/candlepin/commit/5db093f06a4753aa43596594a373087f3aa92d15", "message": "Convert DeletedConsumerResource to the OpenAPI specification\n - Created new specifications for the deleted consumer resource and deleted consumer DTO\n - Updated DeletedConsumerResource to implement the generated API specification\n - Deleted the existing API DeletedConsumerDTO\n - Deleted DeletedConsumerDTOTest test\n - Updated DeletedConsumerTranslator as per generated DTO", "committedDate": "2020-01-24T06:35:52Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3MDYyOTkzMA==", "url": "https://github.com/candlepin/candlepin/pull/2577#discussion_r370629930", "bodyText": "Is this the trend we're following to solve the problem of \"DeletedConsumerDTO is not within its bound; should extend org.candlepin.dto.TimestampedCandlepinDTO\"?
