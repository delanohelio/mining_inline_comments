This is different from Just In Time (JIT) \n+compilation, where a JIT compiler, usually a component of some \n+Virtual Machine (VM), will produce native code from some input source \n+code while the VM is interpreting the same input. Applying AOT to \n+interpreted languages such as Java can be done using a static approach; \n+the AOT compiler will generate code given some input set of classes. \n+Therefore, this kind of AOT can be called Static AOT; OpenJ9, however, \n+uses Dynamic AOT.\n+\n+Dynamic AOT is essentially a hybrid between Static AOT and JIT. The \n+compiler does not generate native code prior to executing Java code but \n+rather _while_ the VM interprets Java code. Thus, the process of \n+performing an AOT compilation is identical to a JIT compilation. \n+However, when performing an AOT compilation, the compiler will also \n+generate validation and relocation information. The code and data is \n+then stored into the Shared Classes Cache (SCC). In a different JVM\n+instance, the code is also loaded on demand; when the time comes to\n+perform a JIT compilation, the compiler checks whether code for the \n+method already exists in the SCC and loads that instead.\n+\n+# Topics\n+\n+1.
