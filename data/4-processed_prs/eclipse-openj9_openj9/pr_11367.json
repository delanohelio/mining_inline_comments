Unfortunately, the itableIndex may not point to the same method in the new version of the class if the methods have been reordered.\nIt's really two pieces of data - class version & itable index - and both need to kept consistent and up to date.\n\n\nhshelp.c::fixDirectHandles: Here J9Methods stored in OpenJ9 MHs are updated. We probably need to do the same for MemberNames->vmtarget (J9Method).\n\n\nThis is carefully set up thru cooperation between the MH creation java code & the redef code to avoid a full heap walk to find the DirectHandles.  We may be able to make the same invariants hold for MemberName but I'm less clear on how to do that without patching the OJDK java code.\nCouple of options here:\n\n\nDo a full heap walk on redefinition to fix the vmtarget & vmindex fields of the MemberName.  This will regress the use cases we fixed by adding the DirectHandle cache but it will be correct.\n\n\nChange vmindex to be an index into class->jniIDs table.  This should let the existing mechanisms fix the JNIID when the class is redefined but will require changes to the way invocation occurs.  We'll also need to figure out how to update vmtarget as well.\n\n\nSomething else?\n\n\nI'd suggest starting with option 1 as it's the easiest to get right and we can figure out how to optimize it later.", "author": "DanHeidinga", "createdAt": "2020-12-18T02:26:02Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0Mzk1NzczMA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0NjgzOTI4NA==", "url": "https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/pull/11367#discussion_r546839284", "bodyText": "I have updated this PR to handle the VM_VMHelpers::currentClass change.
