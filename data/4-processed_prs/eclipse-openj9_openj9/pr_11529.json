But there are a few JITServer specific tips and tricks.\n+Typical OpenJ9 debugging procedures can be followed for JITServer. But there are a few JITServer specific tips and tricks.\n+Unlike regular OpenJ9, where everything runs in one process, JITServer separates JIT compiler into a separate process while constantly\n+working with addresses/objects that are only valid on the client. This makes it very easy to cause a bug on JITServer and may make it hard to catch.\n+In this document we will explore some common types of bugs and crashes that are encountered in JITServer development and how to deal with them.\n+This document should be expanded upon whenever possible.\n \n+## Server-side crashes\n+The most common type of a server crash is a segmentation fault caused by the compiler trying to dereference an address that is only valid on the client.\n+For example, dereferencing `J9Class` pointer will lead to immediate crash in the best case, or some corrupt data being written in the worst case.\n+If you suddenly discover a crash on the server that you haven't seen before, it's most likely caused by a change to mainline JIT code that did not account\n+for JITServer. If that's the case, the crash should be in the newly added code. You should find the commit that introduced it, and rewrite it in such a way\n+that accounts for JITServer, i.e. do not dereference client pointers directly but fetch the result from the client first.\n+\n+## Client-side crashes\n If the client crashes in `handleServerMessage` after receiving some bad data from the server, you will need to find out what the server was doing when it sent the message. The easiest way to do this is by running both the server and client in gdb, then sending the server a Ctrl-C after the client crashes. From the gdb prompt on the server you can type `thread apply all backtrace` and find the appropriate compilation thread to determine where the server was.\n \n-Please add to this file!!\n+## Crashes in compiled code\n+Another way a client can crash is when it runs the compiled method but something is wrong with it. These can be some of the tougher bugs to fix\n+because you will need to find the failing method and look at its trace log to find the problem. Sometimes, the failure is not caused by one compilation\n+but by a series of them, which makes debugging even harder.\n+\n+Tracing method compilation is the same as for non-JITServer - use `-Xjit:{<method_name>}(traceFull,log=<log_name>)` in the client options and both client", "originalCommit": "993de4eb727379a698840dce79383973912900e3", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU1MTQ2MTQ3MQ==", "url": "https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/pull/11529#discussion_r551461471", "bodyText": "Right, I actually forgot that this option exists.", "author": "dmitry-ten", "createdAt": "2021-01-04T17:33:12Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU1MTQwNTUxNw=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU1MTQwNjU5MA==", "url": "https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/pull/11529#discussion_r551406590", "bodyText": "\"Unlike regular OpenJ9 where everything runs in one process, JITServer technology moves the JIT compiler activity into a separate process while ...\"", "author": "mpirvu", "createdAt": "2021-01-04T16:02:40Z", "path": "doc/compiler/jitserver/Problem.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -19,9 +19,40 @@ OpenJDK Assembly Exception [2].\n \n SPDX-License-Identifier: EPL-2.0 OR Apache-2.0 OR GPL-2.0 WITH Classpath-exception-2.0 OR LicenseRef-GPL-2.0 WITH Assembly-exception\n -->\n+# Debugging JITServer\n \n-Usually typical OpenJ9 debugging procedures can be followed for JITServer.

This means that minimizing the number of requests for resolved method creation is important for improving CPU consumption.\n+\n+There are two main ways we optimize resolved method creation:\n+1. Caching all newly created resolved methods in a per-compilation cache on the server. We use `TR_ResolvedMethodInfoCache` and put it in `TR::CompilationInfoPerThreadRemote`.\n+Whenever a resolved method needs to be created, server will first check the cache and recreate the resolved method from there, if possible.\n+2. Prefetching multiple resolved methods before they are first requested. There are parts of the compiler that request many resolved methods in a loop.\n+For example, ILGen and inliner will walk through method bytecodes and create a resolved method for every method call bytecode. \n+We use `TR_ResolvedJ9JITServerMethod::cacheResolvedMethodsCallees` to do a preliminary walk and cache all required methods in one remote call.\n+Techniques like these do not reduce the total number of resolved methods created or data transferred through the network but it reduces the total number of remote calls,\n+which still has a positive impact on CPU consumption.\n+\n+Despite all these optimizations, resolved methods are still responsible for most of the remote messages. This is due to the fact that resolved methods only exist\n+for the duration of a single compilation so any type of persistent caching is not available to us. Maybe there exists some way to get around this limitation", "originalCommit": "993de4eb727379a698840dce79383973912900e3", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU1MTQzMDg3Mg==", "url": "https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/pull/11529#discussion_r551430872", "bodyText": "Maybe we should also mention about the heart-beat?", "author": "mpirvu", "createdAt": "2021-01-04T16:40:22Z", "path": "doc/compiler/jitserver/Usage.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -53,23 +53,37 @@ With verbose logging, if a client connects successfully then server output shoul\n ```\n $ jitserver -Xjit:verbose=\\{JITServer\\}\n \n-JITServer is currently a technology preview.
