The relocation records related to the inlined methods are \n+different from the other records in that they do many things - they perform \n+validation, relocation of the inlined table entry in the J9JITExceptionTable\n+metadata structure, as well as relocation of guards. \n+\n+This document will go through how an inlined site is validated, as well what \n+what all is necessary as part of the relocation. Note, inlined method \n+relocations still follow the high level process described by the\n+[Intro to AOT blog series](https://blog.openj9.org/2018/10/10/intro-to-ahead-of-time-compilation/),\n+which this doc assumes the reader has already read.\n+\n+# Introduction\n+\n+There are four general kinds of inlined method relocations:\n+\n+* Inlined Methods\n+* Inlined Methods with NOP Guards\n+* Profiled Inlined Methods\n+* Profiled Inlined Methods with Guards\n+\n+All relocations are used to validate the inlined method. However, the\n+relocations for methods with guards are used to relocate the associated\n+inlined table entry in the metadata as well as the guards for the \n+inlined sites, whereas the rest are only used to relocate the associated\n+inlined table entry. Profiled Inlined Methods are methods that were \n+inlined that were not named by the caller. For example,\n+consider the following scenario:\n+\n+```\n+class base {\n+\tvoid foo();\n+}\n+class child_one extends base {\n+\tvoid foo();\n+}\n+child class_two extends base {\n+\tvoid foo();\n+}\n+...\n+\tvoid some_method(base b) {\n+\t\tb.foo();\n+\t}\n+```\n+Because `b` is of type `base`, the `foo` that gets executed could either\n+be the implementation in `base` or `child_one` or `child_two`. If the\n+inliner decided to pick `base.foo()` because that is what was named in\n+`some_method`, then the relocation would be the Inlined Method variant.\n+However, if the inliner decided to inline `child_two.foo()` based on \n+profiling information, the relocation would be the Profiled Inlined\n+Method variant.\n+\n+# Generating Guards & External Relocations\n+\n+During an AOT compilation, i.e. when the code is first generated, external\n+relocation are generated at various points. Once all of these external \n+relocations are added to a list, the inlined method external relocations\n+are then added in reverse order; because entries are added to the\n+list at the front, an external relocation associated with the last inlined\n+site index is added first, followed by the second last, continuing to the\n+first. This ensures that the first inlined method external relocation in\n+the list is associated with the first inlined site.\n+\n+The reason for ensuring this is because validating/materialize values for\n+subsequent inlined methods may depend on the previous entry. For example,\n+if `foo() calls bar() calls baz()`, and `bar` and `baz` are inlined (first\n+`bar` would be inlined, then `baz`), `baz` is named in `bar`'s constant\n+pool, and `bar` is named in `foo`'s constant pool. Therefore, in order to\n+materialize the `J9Method` of `baz`, one first needs the `J9Method` of `bar`,\n+which first requires the `J9Method` of `foo`.\n+\n+Generating external relocations for inlined methods requires the \n+existence of Guards. Guards are used to gate execution of regions of \n+code. When a method is inlined, a guard is generated for that inlined \n+method. It is possible for a guard to be removed for various reasons. \n+Currently, an inlined method cannot be validated/relocated without an \n+associated guard<sup>1</sup>. As such, if a guard is removed, it is \n+still kept aside so that the information it holds can be used \n+to create an external relocation. If a guard is removed, the Inlined Method \n+/ Profiled Inlined Method relocations are generated; if the guard remains, \n+the Inlined Method with NOP Guard / Profiled Inlined Method with Guard \n+relocations are generated.\n+\n+Unless the [SVM](https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/blob/master/doc/compiler/aot/SymbolValidationManager.md)\n+is enabled, the inlined method external relocations are the\n+last entries added to the list; if the SVM is enabled, the SVM validation\n+records are added next - part of the validation that would've been done by\n+the inlined method validation procedure is delegated to the SVM.\n+\n+# Validating Inlined Sites \n+\n+The way an inlined method is validated depends on whether it was\n+profiled or not.\n+\n+## Inlined Methods with or without NOP Guards\n+\n+The process starts in `TR_RelocationRecordInlinedMethod::preparePrivateData`.\n+First `TR_RelocationRecordInlinedMethod::inlinedSiteValid` is called, which\n+\n+1. Gets the J9Method of the caller. For the very first inlined site, this will be the method being compiled; for the rest it will be from one of the previously validated/relocated inlined sites.\n+2. Checks if the method has been unloaded.\n+3. Materializes the J9Method of the inlined method:\n+    * If the SVM is enabled the method ID in the relocation record is used.\n+    * If the SVM is disabled, `getMethodFromCP` is called which is a virtual method that has different implementations depending on the kind of inlined method (special, static, virtual, interface).\n+4. Checks if the inlined site can be activated because of debug or other JVM restrictions.\n+5. Checks if J9ROMClass of the J9Method from step 3 matches the J9ROMClass in the SCC based on the offset stored in the relocation record.\n+\n+If everything succeeds, `inlinedSiteValid` returns true. The success or\n+failure is cached in `reloPrivateData->_failValidation`.", "originalCommit": "17e1e321461c675f186edc100e40548c4da06411", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "c823ae9aa2336bc1e614fb7887b193a68f7790be", "url": "https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/commit/c823ae9aa2336bc1e614fb7887b193a68f7790be", "message": "Add doc for relocation of inlined methods\n\n[ci skip]\n\nSigned-off-by: Irwin D'Souza <dsouzai.gh@gmail.com>", "committedDate": "2020-12-08T18:31:28Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"oid": "358163ff6c6e5da3ba1847924056bc0cf618db2d", "url": "https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/commit/358163ff6c6e5da3ba1847924056bc0cf618db2d", "message": "Add doc for relocation of inlined methods\n\n[ci skip]\n\nSigned-off-by: Irwin D'Souza <dsouzai.gh@gmail.com>", "committedDate": "2020-12-08T18:32:57Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"oid": "8aa7b8d2d7ea4ba3150c6c1367b4506898f301ab", "url": "https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/commit/8aa7b8d2d7ea4ba3150c6c1367b4506898f301ab", "message": "Add doc for relocation of inlined methods\n\n[ci skip]\n\nSigned-off-by: Irwin D'Souza <dsouzai.gh@gmail.com>", "committedDate": "2020-12-08T18:37:29Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "8aa7b8d2d7ea4ba3150c6c1367b4506898f301ab", "url": "https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/commit/8aa7b8d2d7ea4ba3150c6c1367b4506898f301ab", "message": "Add doc for relocation of inlined methods\n\n[ci skip]\n\nSigned-off-by: Irwin D'Souza <dsouzai.gh@gmail.com>", "committedDate": "2020-12-08T18:37:29Z", "type": "forcePushed"}]}
