There's even an old, now closed PR where matching the brackets to what the clang tool says it does with the conditional results in crashes at runtime.  Easier to introduce the brackets when simple than to retrofit later.", "author": "DanHeidinga", "createdAt": "2020-06-19T14:46:37Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0Mjg1MTQyNQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0MjkxMjMyNg==", "url": "https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9/pull/9945#discussion_r442912326", "bodyText": "I certainly see there are benefits to explicit braces, but I also believe there is a benefit to keeping the code uniform. Rather than changing the code convention piecemeal I'd prefer to make this kind of change as a more considered more global change.
