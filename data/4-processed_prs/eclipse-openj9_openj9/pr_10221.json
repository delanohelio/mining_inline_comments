The first thing you need to do is install Docker. You can download the free Community edition from [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/), which also contains instructions for installing Docker on your system.  You should also read the [Getting started](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) guide to familiarise yourself with the basic Docker concepts and terminology.\n+\n+2.

The first thing you need to do is install Docker. You can download the free Community edition from [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/), which also contains instructions for installing Docker on your system.  You should also read the [Getting started](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) guide to familiarise yourself with the basic Docker concepts and terminology.\n+\n+2. Obtain the [docker build script](https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/blob/master/buildenv/docker/mkdocker.sh) to build and run a container that has all the correct software pre-requisites.\n+\n+Download the docker build script to your local system or copy and paste the following command:\n+\n+```\n+wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse/openj9/master/buildenv/docker/mkdocker.sh\n+```\n+\n+3. Next, run the following command to build a Docker image, called **openj9**:\n+```\n+bash mkdocker.sh --tag=openj9 --dist=ubuntu --version=16.04 --build\n+```\n+\n+4. Start a Docker container from the **openj9** image with the following command, where `-v` maps any directory, `<host_directory>`,\n+on your local system to the containers `/root/hostdir` directory so that you can store the binaries, once they are built:\n+```\n+docker run -v <host_directory>:/root/hostdir -it openj9\n+```\n+\n+:pencil: Depending on your [Docker system configuration](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/#description), you might need to prefix the `docker` commands with `sudo`.\n+\n+Now that you have the Docker image running, you are ready to move to the next step, [Get the source](#2-get-the-source).\n+\n+#### Setting up your build environment without Docker\n+\n+If you don't want to user Docker, you can still build directly on your Ubuntu system or in a Ubuntu virtual machine. Use the output of the following command like a recipe card to determine the software dependencies that must be installed on the system, plus a few configuration steps.\n+\n+```\n+bash mkdocker.sh --tag=openj9 --dist=ubuntu --version=16.04 --print\n+```\n+\n+1. Install the list of dependencies that can be obtained with the `apt-get` command from the following section of the Dockerfile:\n+```\n+apt-get update \\\n+  && apt-get install -qq -y --no-install-recommends \\\n+    ...\n+```\n+\n+2. The previous step installed g++-7 and gcc-7 packages, which might be different\n+than the default version installed on your system. Export variables to set the\n+version used in the build.\n+```\n+export CC=gcc-7 CXX=g++-7\n+```\n+\n+3. Download and setup **freemarker.jar** into a directory.\n+```\n+cd /<my_home_dir>\n+wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/freemarker/files/freemarker/2.3.8/freemarker-2.3.8.tar.gz/download -O freemarker.tgz\n+tar -xzf freemarker.tgz freemarker-2.3.8/lib/freemarker.jar --strip=2\n+rm -f freemarker.tgz\n+```\n+\n+4. Download and setup the boot JDK using the latest AdoptOpenJDK v14 build.\n+```\n+cd /<my_home_dir>\n+wget -O bootjdk14.tar.gz \"https://api.adoptopenjdk.net/v3/binary/latest/14/ga/linux/x64/jdk/openj9/normal/adoptopenjdk\"\n+tar -xzf bootjdk14.tar.gz\n+rm -f bootjdk14.tar.gz\n+mv $(ls | grep -i jdk-14) bootjdk14\n+```\n+\n+### 2.

When the process is complete, change directory into the cloned repository:\n+```\n+cd openj9-openjdk-jdk15\n+```\n+Now fetch additional sources from the Eclipse OpenJ9 project and its clone of Eclipse OMR:\n+\n+```\n+bash get_source.sh\n+```\n+\n+:pencil: **OpenSSL support:** If you want to build an OpenJDK with OpenJ9 binary with OpenSSL support and you do not have a built version of OpenSSL v1.0.2 or v1.1.x available locally, you must obtain a prebuilt OpenSSL binary.\n+\n+### 3. Configure\n+:apple:\n+When you have all the source files that you need, run the configure script, which detects how to build in the current build environment.\n+\n+```\n+bash configure \\\n+    --with-boot-jdk=<path_to_boot_JDK14> \\\n+    --with-freemarker-jar=/<my_home_dir>/freemarker.jar\n+```\n+\n+:pencil: Modify the paths for freemarker and the macOS boot JDK that you installed in step 1. If `configure` is unable to detect Freetype, add the option `--with-freetype=<path to freetype>`, where `<path to freetype>` is typically `/usr/local/Cellar/freetype/2.9.1/`.\n+\n+:pencil: **Non-compressed references support:** If you require a heap size greater than 57GB, enable a noncompressedrefs build with the `--with-noncompressedrefs` option during this step.\n+\n+:pencil: **OpenSSL support:** If you want to build an OpenJDK that includes OpenSSL, you must specify `--with-openssl=path_to_library`, where `path_to_library` specifies the path to the prebuilt OpenSSL library that you obtained in **2. Get the source**. If you want to include the OpenSSL cryptographic library in the OpenJDK binary, you must also include `--enable-openssl-bundling`.\n+\n+### 4. build\n+:apple:\n+Now you're ready to build OpenJDK with OpenJ9:\n+\n+```\n+make all\n+```\n+:warning: If you just type `make`, rather than `make all` your build will be incomplete, because the default `make` target is `exploded-image`.\n+If you want to specify `make` instead of `make all`, you must add `--default-make-target=images` when you run the configure script.\n+\n+Two builds of OpenJDK with Eclipse OpenJ9 are built and stored in the following directories:\n+\n+- **build/macosx-x86_64-server-release/images/jdk**\n+- **build/macosx-x86_64-server-release/images/jdk-bundle**\n+\n+    :pencil: For running applications such as Eclipse, use the **-bundle** version.\n+\n+    :pencil: If you want a binary for the runtime environment (jre), you must run `make legacy-jre-image`, which produces a jre build in the **build/macosx-x86_64-server-release/images/jre** directory.\n+\n+### 5. Test\n+:apple:\n+For a simple test, try running the `java -version` command. Change to the jdk directory:\n+```\n+cd build/macosx-x86_64-server-release/images/jdk\n+```\n+Run:\n+```\n+./bin/java -version\n+```\n+\n+Here is some sample output:\n+\n+```\n+openjdk version \"15-internal\" 2020-09-01\n+OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 15-internal+0-adhoc.jenkins.Build-JDK15-osxx86-64cmprssptrs)\n+Eclipse OpenJ9 VM (build tye-e85051733, JRE 15 Mac OS X amd64-64-Bit Compressed References 20200901_27 (JIT enabled, AOT enabled)\n+OpenJ9   - e85051733\n+OMR      - dfbca14c\n+JCL      - 2ef6b4c54d8 based on jdk-15+30)\n+```\n+\n+:pencil: **OpenSSL support:** If you built an OpenJDK with OpenJ9 that includes OpenSSL support, the following acknowledgements apply in accordance with the license terms:\n+\n+- *This product includes software developed by the OpenSSL Project for use in the OpenSSL Toolkit.
