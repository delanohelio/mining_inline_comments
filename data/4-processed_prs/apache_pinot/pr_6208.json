This part is quite tricky because the routing needs to still work when we change the replica-groups and run the rebalance, and the query time computation needs to be as fast as possible. If we can come up with a simpler and better algorithm, we can definitely re-implement this class.", "author": "Jackie-Jiang", "createdAt": "2020-11-01T05:24:24Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxNTU2ODk0NQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "ae8394f1781d4bc2e7194e4a6f093fe0629cefb4", "url": "https://github.com/apache/pinot/commit/ae8394f1781d4bc2e7194e4a6f093fe0629cefb4", "message": "Add StrictReplicaGroupInstanceSelector", "committedDate": "2020-11-01T05:26:39Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "3635880a5ab7ca04bdbb126690e6ba8d524809cb", "url": "https://github.com/apache/pinot/commit/3635880a5ab7ca04bdbb126690e6ba8d524809cb", "message": "Address comments", "committedDate": "2020-11-01T05:26:39Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"oid": "e64f1964dcc3c77cbe6c2b55bc43ffada7d48f4f", "url": "https://github.com/apache/pinot/commit/e64f1964dcc3c77cbe6c2b55bc43ffada7d48f4f", "message": "Address comments", "committedDate": "2020-11-01T07:37:51Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "e64f1964dcc3c77cbe6c2b55bc43ffada7d48f4f", "url": "https://github.com/apache/pinot/commit/e64f1964dcc3c77cbe6c2b55bc43ffada7d48f4f", "message": "Address comments", "committedDate": "2020-11-01T07:37:51Z", "type": "forcePushed"}]}
