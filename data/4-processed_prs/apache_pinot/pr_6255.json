Even for a single use case, there are multiple questions to be answered before we can arrive at the right parameters to use. This being the case, I don't think we can automatically tune a use case just given schema and table config, except for the very basic of the basic use cases (where performance probably does not matter).\nWe need to have some sample data (or maybe a DataDescriptor class that may point to sample data, or in other way describe the data in some way -- I have even thought about including such a hint in the schema, for example -- with fields such as expected cardinality, average length of string columns, etc.),and also sample queries.\nWith this we can arrive at some automated code (as Jia has done) to come up with recommendations. The flag of applying those recommendations can be optional. In some cases, we can directly apply the recommendations. In others, we can let the admins decide.\nSimilarly, for realtime, we need to come up with an optimal segment size for the use case.\nThe problem of multi-tenant is yet another dimension, where the tuning we do for one table can be potentially bad for another one.\nOne thing we can do is to add a periodic task that tunes and rebalances tables, etc. The interface in that case is meaningless because the task has access to pretty much everything -- past segments, past queries, cardinality of columns, whatever. We could also add this as a minion task. There is no need of an interface in that case, other than a cluster-wide setting that says table must be auto-tuned, and maybe a flag within a table asking not to touch this one.\nI think the interface you are trying to define, and the problem you are trying to solve, is that of initial provisioning and not continuous tuning.\nWithout having visibility into the problem you are trying to solve, it gets a bit hard to review an interface.", "author": "mcvsubbu", "createdAt": "2020-11-25T19:18:47Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUzMDUzMzMzNQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0MDM5MDQyMw==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/6255#discussion_r540390423", "bodyText": "Resolving conversation - the PR has been updated based on the suggestion", "author": "icefury71", "createdAt": "2020-12-10T18:13:12Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUzMDUzMzMzNQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0MDM1NjY5MQ==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/6255#discussion_r540356691", "bodyText": "Is this the tuner registered by default with the TableConfigTunerRegistry?", "author": "siddharthteotia", "createdAt": "2020-12-10T17:25:53Z", "path": "pinot-common/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/common/config/tuner/NoOpTableTableConfigTuner.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,38 @@\n+/**\n+ * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\n+ * or more contributor license agreements.
