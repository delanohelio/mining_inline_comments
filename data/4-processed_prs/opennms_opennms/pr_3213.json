managed entities (nodes, interfaces, and IP based services).\n-Version 1.2 added and _XML-RPC API_ as a more controlled (directed) strategy for provisioning services that was mainly used by non telco based service providers (i.e. managed hosting companies).\n-Version 1.6 followed this up with yet another and more advanced mechanism called the _Importer service daemon_.\n-The _Importer_ provided large service providers with the ability to strictly control the OpenNMS entity provisioning with an XML based API for completely defining and controlling the entities where no discovery and service scanning scanning was feasible.\n-\n-The Importer service improved OpenNMS' scalability for maintaining managed entity databases by an order of magnitude.\n-This daemon, while very simple in concept and yet extremely powerful and flexible provisioning improvement, has blazed the trail for Provisiond.\n-The Importer service has been in production for 3 years in service provider networks maintaining entity counts of more than 50,000 node level entities on a single instances of OpenNMS.\n-It is a rock solid provisioning tool.\n-\n-_Provisiond_ begins a new era of managed entity provisioning in OpenNMS.\n+Provisioning is a mechanism to import node and service definitions either from an external source such as DNS or HTTP or via the {opennms-product-name} web UI.\n+The _Provisiond_ daemon maintains your managed entity inventory through policy-based provisioning. \n+\n+Provisiond comes with a RESTful Web Service API for easy integration with external systems such as CRM or external inventory systems.\n+It also includes an adapter API for interfacing with other management systems such as configuration management.\n+\n+[[provisioning-works]]\n+==== How It Works\n+\n+Provisiond receives requests to add managed entities (nodes, IP interfaces, SNMP interfaces, services) via three basic mechanisms: \n+\n+* link:#discovery-auto[automatic discovery] (typically via the Discovery daemon)\n+* link:#discovery-directed[directed discovery] using an import requisition (typically via the Provisioning UI)\n+* link:#asset-import[asset import] through the RestAPI or the https://docs.opennms.org/pris/branches/master/pris/pris.html[provisioning integration server] (PRIS)\n+\n+{opennms-product-name} enables you to control Provisiond behavior by creating provisioning policies that include scanning frequency, IP ranges, and which services to detect. \n+\n+Regardless of the method, provisioning is an iterative process: you will need to fine-tune your results to exclude or add things to what you monitor.\n+\n+[[discovery-auto]]\n+==== Automatic Discovery\n+\n+{opennms-product-name} uses an ICMP ping sweep to find IP addresses on the network and provision node entities.\n+Using link:#ga-provisioning-auto-discovery-detectors[auto discovery with detectors] allows you to specify services that you need to detect in addition to the ICMP IP address ping. \n+link:#import-handlers[Import handlers] allow you to further control provisioning. #is this just through directed discovery?#\n+\n+Automatically discovered entities are analyzed, persisted to the relational data store, and managed based on the policies defined in the link:#foreign-source-definition[default foreign source definition]:\n+\n+* scanned to discover node entity\u2019s interfaces (SNMP and IP)\n+* interfaces are persisted\n+* service detection of each IP interface\n+* node merging\n+\n+NOTE: Merging occurs only when two automatically discovered nodes appear to be the same node.\n+Nodes link:#discovery-directed[discovered directly] are not included in the node merging process.\n+\n+[[discovery-directed]]\n+==== Directed Discovery\n+Directed discovery allows you to specify what you want to provision based on an existing data source such as an in-house inventory, stand-alone provisioning system, or set of element management systems. \n+Using an import requisition, this mechanism directs {opennms-product-name} to add, update, or delete a node entity exactly as defined by the external source. \n+No discovery process is used for finding more interfaces or services.\n+\n+IMPORTANT: An import requisition is an XML definition of node entities to be provisioned from an external source into {opennms-product-name}.\n+See the http://xmlns.opennms.org/xsd/config/model-import[requisition schema] (XSD) for more information. \n+\n+===== Understanding the Process\n+\n+Directed disovery involves three phases:\n+\n+* import (with three sub-phases)\n+** marshal\n+** audit\n+** limited SNMP scan\n+* node scan\n+* service scan\n+\n+The import phase begins when Provisiond receives a request to import a requisition from a URL.\n+The requisition is marshalled into Java objects for processing. \n+An audit, based on the unique foreign ID of the foreign source, determines whether the node already exists; the imported object is then added, updated, or deleted from the inventory.  \n+\n+NOTE: If any syntactical or XML structural problems occur in the requisition, the entire import is abandoned and no import operations are completed.\n+\n+If a requisition node has an interface defined as the primary SNMP interface, then during the update and add operations the node is scanned for minimal SNMP attribute information.\n+\n+The node scan phase discovers details about the node and interfaces that were not directly provisioned.\n+All physical (SNMP) and logical (IP) interfaces are discovered and persisted based on any provisioning policies that may have been defined for the foreign source associated with the import requisition.\n+\n+After interface discovery, Provisiond moves to service detection on each IP interface entity.\n+\n+For more details on how provisioning works in {opennms-product-name}, see this archived https://wiki.opennms.org/wiki/images/c/ca/ProvisioningUsersGuide.pdf[provisioning
