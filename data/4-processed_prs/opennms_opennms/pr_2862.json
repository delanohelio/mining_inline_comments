This would make it difficult if we decided to split these up into separate modules as this module would always have to depend on the implementation.\nWe could consider if this is worth changing, if it is I don't think there is a convenient solution that avoids changing a bunch of code. One solution would be to remove the copy method from the interface, then add a factory method to the existing mutable bean that takes an interface type and produces a bean copy of that object. That way the decision of typing the mutable object is pushed down to the client, they would explicitly decide they want to get a copy using the JAXB object via its new factory method.\nThis would apply to all the new interfaces with toMutableCopy() methods.\nI didn't really think of this possibility when we were originally discussing how to produce these copies.", "author": "mattixtech", "createdAt": "2020-01-08T15:17:40Z", "path": "features/events/api/src/main/java/org/opennms/netmgt/xml/event/IAlarmData.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,48 @@\n+/*******************************************************************************\n+ * This file is part of OpenNMS(R).\n+ *\n+ * Copyright (C) 2020 The OpenNMS Group, Inc.\n+ * OpenNMS(R) is Copyright (C) 1999-2020 The OpenNMS Group, Inc.\n+ *\n+ * OpenNMS(R) is a registered trademark of The OpenNMS Group, Inc.\n+ *\n+ * OpenNMS(R) is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n+ * it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published\n+ * by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License,\n+ * or (at your option) any later version.\n+ *\n+ * OpenNMS(R) is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n+ * but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n+ * MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
