For instance, with deposits the cleanup deposit job should handle this (you should verify that it does so after these changes. To test on your vm I suggest setting the cleanup time property for the deposit application to something very low, like 20second). The intention of switching to copy is so that we don't lose the source data in the case that the larger operation fails.\nYou should also check if there are other uses of this transfer method from non-deposit related activities, since they should now be doing their own source file cleanup.", "author": "bbpennel", "createdAt": "2020-10-01T14:26:12Z", "path": "persistence/src/main/java/edu/unc/lib/dl/persist/services/transfer/FSToFSTransferClient.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -112,6 +108,16 @@ public URI transfer(PID binPid, URI sourceFileUri, boolean allowOverwrite) {\n                 // Ignore.
