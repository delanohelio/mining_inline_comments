I see you've done this already in some of your ITs, which is correct.\nConfigurations ONLY need to be added to this local.cfg if they CANNOT be reloaded/set dynamically.  There are very few configurations that fall into this category...mostly those that initialize our database/webapp.\nIn any case, all the above is just an FYI.
