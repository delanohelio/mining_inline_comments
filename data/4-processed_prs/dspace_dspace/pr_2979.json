It almost seems like previously we had to loop through the keys in the uploadConfigurationService to locate the one that matched with UploadValidation.getName().   Now, it looks like the loop has no purpose, as we're just calling get(config.getId()) to grab the UploadConfiguration that we want directly.\nAm I misunderstanding this tiny change?  It almost seems like we can remove this for loop entirely.", "author": "tdonohue", "createdAt": "2020-09-29T17:06:09Z", "path": "dspace-server-webapp/src/main/java/org/dspace/app/rest/submit/step/validation/UploadValidation.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -43,7 +43,7 @@\n \n         for (String key : uploadConfigurationService.getMap().keySet()) {\n             if (getName().equals(key)) {\n-                UploadConfiguration uploadConfig = uploadConfigurationService.getMap().get(key);\n+                UploadConfiguration uploadConfig = uploadConfigurationService.getMap().get(config.getId());", "originalCommit": "88e073d8f2deaa23ad2155aa916fe6c40d8ae43c", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5ODM1NjcyMA==", "url": "https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/2979#discussion_r498356720", "bodyText": "You're right, no need to find a match on this key, so I've removed the loop\nI also re-tested, and didn't see any problems", "author": "benbosman", "createdAt": "2020-10-01T16:01:52Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5NjkwMTI4Mg=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "8f824c0642073d96ae6c3907361c9f040bd0db5d", "url": "https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/commit/8f824c0642073d96ae6c3907361c9f040bd0db5d", "message": "for loop is not applicable", "committedDate": "2020-10-01T14:17:26Z", "type": "commit"}]}
