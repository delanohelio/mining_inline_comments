In any case, I'd appreciate it if you could test this on Oracle to ensure it'll work there as well.  If so, then it's fine as-is.  If not, then we need to figure out a different solution that allows the Oracle SQL and Postgres SQL to be different.

Afterall, you are reading the SQL migration script into a String (see dataMigrateSQL on line 63).   Therefore, why not do something like this:\n// Get SQL script (based on DB type)\nString dataMigrateSQL = MigrationUtils.getResourceAsString(sqlMigrationPath + \"V7.0_2020.10.31__CollectionCommunity_Metadata_Handle.sql\");\n\n// Replace ${handle.canonical.prefix} variable in SQL script with value from Configuration\nMap<String, String> valuesMap = new HashMap<>();\nvaluesMap.put(\"handle.canonical.prefix\", handleService.getCanonicalPrefix());\nStringSubstitutor sub = new StringSubstitutor(valuesMap);\ndataMigrateSQL = sub.replace(dataMigrateSQL);\n\n// Run the resulting script\nDatabaseUtils.executeSql(context.getConnection(), dataMigrateSQL);\n\nTo me, this would be a lot cleaner & easier for other developers to understand.  It'd only require that you add a ${handle.canonical.prefix} placeholder into the SQL scripts where it is necessary.
