Since Traceability is crucial for healthcare API users, every\n+input or error message will be recorded in the output of the DICOM io\n+connector. As a result, every PTransform in this module will return a\n+Pcollection of dict that encodes results and detailed error messages.\n+\n+Search instance's metadata (QIDO request)\n+===================================================\n+DicomSearch() wraps the QIDO request client and supports 3 levels of search.\n+Users should specify the level by setting the 'search_type' entry in the input\n+dict. They can also refine the search by adding tags to filter the results using\n+the 'params' entry. Here is a sample usage:\n+\n+  with Pipeline() as p:\n+    input_dict = p | beam.Create([\n+      {'project_id': 'abc123', 'type': 'instances',...},\n+      {'project_id': 'dicom_go', 'type': 'series',...}\n+    ])\n+    results = input_dict| io.gcp.DicomSearch()\n+    results | 'print successful search' >> beam.Map(\n+        lambda x: print(x['result'] if x['success'] else None))\n+    results | 'print failed search' >> beam.Map(\n+        lambda x: print(x['result'] if not x['success'] else None))\n+\n+In the example above, successful qido search results and error messages for\n+failed requests are printed. When used in real life, user can choose to filter\n+those data and output them to wherever they want.\n+\n+Convert DICOM Pubsub message to Qido search request\n+===================================================\n+Healthcare API users might use Beam's Pubsub streaming pipeline to monitor the\n+store operations (new DICOM file) in a DICOM storage. Pubsub message encodes\n+DICOM a web store path as well as instance ids. If users are interested in\n+getting new instance's metadata, they can use PubsubToQido() to convert the\n+message into Qido Search dict then use DicomSearch(). Here is a sample usage:\n+\n+  pipeline_options = PipelineOptions()\n+  pipeline_options.view_as(StandardOptions).streaming = True\n+  with beam.Pipeline(options=pipeline_options) as p:\n+    pubsub = p | beam.io.ReadStringFromPubsub(subscription='a_dicom_store')\n+    results = pubsub | PubsubToQido()\n+    success = results | 'filter message' >> beam.Filter(lambda x: x['success'])\n+    qido_dict = success | 'get qido request' >> beam.Map(lambda x: x['result'])\n+    metadata = qido_dict | DicomSearch()\n+\n+In the example above, the pipeline is listening to a pubsub topic and waiting\n+for messages from DICOM API. When a new DICOM file comes into the storage, the\n+pipeline will receive a pubsub message, convert it to a Qido request dict and\n+feed it to DicomSearch() PTransform. As a result, users can get the metadata for\n+every new DICOM file. Note that not every pubsub message received is from DICOM\n+API, so we to filter the results first.\n+\n+Store a DICOM file in a DICOM storage\n+===================================================\n+DicomStoreInstance() wraps store request API and users can use it to send a\n+DICOM file to a DICOM store. It supports two types of input: 1.file data in\n+byte[] 2.fileio object. Users should set the 'input_type' when initialzing\n+this PTransform. Here are the examples:\n+\n+  with Pipeline() as p:\n+    input_dict = {'project_id': 'abc123', 'type': 'instances',...}\n+    path = \"gcs://bucketname/something/a.dcm\"\n+    match = p | fileio.MatchFiles(path)\n+    fileio_obj = match | fileio.ReadAll()\n+    results = fileio_obj | DicomStoreInstance(input_dict, 'fileio')\n+\n+  with Pipeline() as p:\n+    input_dict = {'project_id': 'abc123', 'type': 'instances',...}\n+    f = open(\"abc.dcm\", \"rb\")\n+    dcm_file = f.read()\n+    byte_file = p | 'create byte file' >> beam.Create([dcm_file])\n+    results = byte_file | DicomStoreInstance(input_dict, 'bytes')\n+\n+The first example uses a PCollection of fileio objects as input.\n+DicomStoreInstance will read DICOM files from the objects and send them\n+to a DICOM storage.\n+The second example uses a PCollection of byte[] as input. DicomStoreInstance\n+will directly send those DICOM files to a DICOM storage.\n+Users can also get the operation results in the output PCollection if they want\n+to handle the failed store requests.\n+\"\"\"\n+\n+# pytype: skip-file\n+from __future__ import absolute_import\n+\n+import apache_beam as beam\n+from apache_beam.io.gcp.dicomclient import DicomApiHttpClient\n+from apache_beam.transforms import PTransform\n+\n+\n+class DicomSearch(PTransform):\n+  \"\"\"A PTransform used for retrieving DICOM instance metadata from Google\n+    Cloud DICOM store.

Since Traceability is crucial for healthcare API users, every\n+input or error message will be recorded in the output of the DICOM io\n+connector. As a result, every PTransform in this module will return a\n+Pcollection of dict that encodes results and detailed error messages.\n+\n+Search instance's metadata (QIDO request)\n+===================================================\n+DicomSearch() wraps the QIDO request client and supports 3 levels of search.\n+Users should specify the level by setting the 'search_type' entry in the input\n+dict. They can also refine the search by adding tags to filter the results using\n+the 'params' entry. Here is a sample usage:\n+\n+  with Pipeline() as p:\n+    input_dict = p | beam.Create([\n+      {'project_id': 'abc123', 'type': 'instances',...},\n+      {'project_id': 'dicom_go', 'type': 'series',...}\n+    ])\n+    results = input_dict| io.gcp.DicomSearch()\n+    results | 'print successful search' >> beam.Map(\n+        lambda x: print(x['result'] if x['success'] else None))\n+    results | 'print failed search' >> beam.Map(\n+        lambda x: print(x['result'] if not x['success'] else None))\n+\n+In the example above, successful qido search results and error messages for\n+failed requests are printed. When used in real life, user can choose to filter\n+those data and output them to wherever they want.\n+\n+Convert DICOM Pubsub message to Qido search request\n+===================================================\n+Healthcare API users might use Beam's Pubsub streaming pipeline to monitor the\n+store operations (new DICOM file) in a DICOM storage. Pubsub message encodes\n+DICOM a web store path as well as instance ids. If users are interested in\n+getting new instance's metadata, they can use PubsubToQido() to convert the\n+message into Qido Search dict then use DicomSearch(). Here is a sample usage:\n+\n+  pipeline_options = PipelineOptions()\n+  pipeline_options.view_as(StandardOptions).streaming = True\n+  with beam.Pipeline(options=pipeline_options) as p:\n+    pubsub = p | beam.io.ReadStringFromPubsub(subscription='a_dicom_store')\n+    results = pubsub | PubsubToQido()\n+    success = results | 'filter message' >> beam.Filter(lambda x: x['success'])\n+    qido_dict = success | 'get qido request' >> beam.Map(lambda x: x['result'])\n+    metadata = qido_dict | DicomSearch()\n+\n+In the example above, the pipeline is listening to a pubsub topic and waiting\n+for messages from DICOM API. When a new DICOM file comes into the storage, the\n+pipeline will receive a pubsub message, convert it to a Qido request dict and\n+feed it to DicomSearch() PTransform. As a result, users can get the metadata for\n+every new DICOM file. Note that not every pubsub message received is from DICOM\n+API, so we to filter the results first.\n+\n+Store a DICOM file in a DICOM storage\n+===================================================\n+DicomStoreInstance() wraps store request API and users can use it to send a\n+DICOM file to a DICOM store. It supports two types of input: 1.file data in\n+byte[] 2.fileio object. Users should set the 'input_type' when initialzing\n+this PTransform. Here are the examples:\n+\n+  with Pipeline() as p:\n+    input_dict = {'project_id': 'abc123', 'type': 'instances',...}\n+    path = \"gcs://bucketname/something/a.dcm\"\n+    match = p | fileio.MatchFiles(path)\n+    fileio_obj = match | fileio.ReadAll()\n+    results = fileio_obj | DicomStoreInstance(input_dict, 'fileio')\n+\n+  with Pipeline() as p:\n+    input_dict = {'project_id': 'abc123', 'type': 'instances',...}\n+    f = open(\"abc.dcm\", \"rb\")\n+    dcm_file = f.read()\n+    byte_file = p | 'create byte file' >> beam.Create([dcm_file])\n+    results = byte_file | DicomStoreInstance(input_dict, 'bytes')\n+\n+The first example uses a PCollection of fileio objects as input.\n+DicomStoreInstance will read DICOM files from the objects and send them\n+to a DICOM storage.\n+The second example uses a PCollection of byte[] as input. DicomStoreInstance\n+will directly send those DICOM files to a DICOM storage.\n+Users can also get the operation results in the output PCollection if they want\n+to handle the failed store requests.\n+\"\"\"\n+\n+# pytype: skip-file\n+from __future__ import absolute_import\n+\n+import apache_beam as beam\n+from apache_beam.io.gcp.dicomclient import DicomApiHttpClient\n+from apache_beam.transforms import PTransform\n+\n+\n+class DicomSearch(PTransform):\n+  \"\"\"A PTransform used for retrieving DICOM instance metadata from Google\n+    Cloud DICOM store.

When used together with Google Pubsub message connector,\n+a PTransform implemented in this module can be used to convert pubsub\n+messages to search requests. Since Traceability is crucial for healthcare\n+API users, every input or error message will be recorded in the output of\n+the DICOM IO connector. As a result, every PTransform in this module will\n+return a PCollection of dict that encodes results and detailed error messages.\n+\n+Search instance's metadata (QIDO request)\n+===================================================\n+DicomSearch() wraps the QIDO request client and supports 3 levels of search.\n+Users should specify the level by setting the 'search_type' entry in the input\n+dict. They can also refine the search by adding tags to filter the results using\n+the 'params' entry. Here is a sample usage:\n+\n+  with Pipeline() as p:\n+    input_dict = p | beam.Create(\n+      [{'project_id': 'abc123', 'type': 'instances',...},\n+      {'project_id': 'dicom_go', 'type': 'series',...}])\n+\n+    results = input_dict | io.gcp.DicomSearch()\n+    results | 'print successful search' >> beam.Map(\n+    lambda x: print(x['result'] if x['success'] else None))\n+\n+    results | 'print failed search' >> beam.Map(\n+    lambda x: print(x['result'] if not x['success'] else None))\n+\n+In the example above, successful qido search results and error messages for\n+failed requests are printed. When used in real life, user can choose to filter\n+those data and output them to wherever they want.\n+\n+Convert DICOM Pubsub message to Qido search request\n+===================================================\n+Healthcare API users might use Beam's Pubsub streaming pipeline to monitor the\n+store operations (new DICOM file) in a DICOM storage. Pubsub message encodes\n+DICOM a web store path as well as instance ids. If users are interested in\n+getting new instance's metadata, they can use PubsubToQido() to convert the\n+message into Qido Search dict then use DicomSearch(). Here is a sample usage:\n+\n+  pipeline_options = PipelineOptions()\n+  pipeline_options.view_as(StandardOptions).streaming = True\n+  p =  beam.Pipeline(options=pipeline_options)\n+  pubsub = p | beam.io.ReadStringFromPubsub(subscription='a_dicom_store')\n+  results = pubsub | PubsubToQido()\n+  success = results | 'filter message' >> beam.Filter(lambda x: x['success'])\n+  qido_dict = success | 'get qido request' >> beam.Map(lambda x: x['result'])\n+  metadata = qido_dict | DicomSearch()\n+\n+In the example above, the pipeline is listening to a pubsub topic and waiting\n+for messages from DICOM API. When a new DICOM file comes into the storage, the\n+pipeline will receive a pubsub message, convert it to a Qido request dict and\n+feed it to DicomSearch() PTransform. As a result, users can get the metadata for\n+every new DICOM file.

It supports two types of input: 1.file data in\n+byte[] 2.fileio object. Users should set the 'input_type' when initialzing\n+this PTransform. Here are the examples:\n+\n+  with Pipeline() as p:\n+    input_dict = {'project_id': 'abc123', 'type': 'instances',...}\n+    path = \"gcs://bucketname/something/a.dcm\"\n+    match = p | fileio.MatchFiles(path)\n+    fileio_obj = match | fileio.ReadAll()\n+    results = fileio_obj | DicomStoreInstance(input_dict, 'fileio')", "originalCommit": "b5a018b23de35ca1cb082c0ae97e60bce6a0146a", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2NDYzNjc3Mg==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/12331#discussion_r464636772", "bodyText": "changed", "author": "George-Wu", "createdAt": "2020-08-03T20:11:17Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2NDYyODM2Mg=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2NDYyOTQ2OA==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/12331#discussion_r464629468", "bodyText": "Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n            Healthcare API users might use Beam's Pubsub streaming pipeline to monitor the\n          \n          \n            \n            store operations (new DICOM file) in a DICOM storage.

When used together with Google Pubsub message connector,\n+a PTransform implemented in this module can be used to convert pubsub\n+messages to search requests. Since Traceability is crucial for healthcare\n+API users, every input or error message will be recorded in the output of\n+the DICOM IO connector. As a result, every PTransform in this module will\n+return a PCollection of dict that encodes results and detailed error messages.\n+\n+Search instance's metadata (QIDO request)\n+===================================================\n+DicomSearch() wraps the QIDO request client and supports 3 levels of search.\n+Users should specify the level by setting the 'search_type' entry in the input\n+dict. They can also refine the search by adding tags to filter the results using\n+the 'params' entry. Here is a sample usage:\n+\n+  with Pipeline() as p:\n+    input_dict = p | beam.Create(\n+      [{'project_id': 'abc123', 'type': 'instances',...},\n+      {'project_id': 'dicom_go', 'type': 'series',...}])\n+\n+    results = input_dict | io.gcp.DicomSearch()\n+    results | 'print successful search' >> beam.Map(\n+    lambda x: print(x['result'] if x['success'] else None))\n+\n+    results | 'print failed search' >> beam.Map(\n+    lambda x: print(x['result'] if not x['success'] else None))\n+\n+In the example above, successful qido search results and error messages for\n+failed requests are printed. When used in real life, user can choose to filter\n+those data and output them to wherever they want.\n+\n+Convert DICOM Pubsub message to Qido search request\n+===================================================\n+Healthcare API users might use Beam's Pubsub streaming pipeline to monitor the\n+store operations (new DICOM file) in a DICOM storage. Pubsub message encodes\n+DICOM a web store path as well as instance ids. If users are interested in\n+getting new instance's metadata, they can use PubsubToQido() to convert the\n+message into Qido Search dict then use DicomSearch().
