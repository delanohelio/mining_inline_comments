This job is flaky, because it's being executed with its batch version at the same time on the same Jenkins worker. Our Flink cluster requires local port forwarding. When two jobs set up port forwarding at the same time, one of them fails eventually. I hope this change will fix that.\nIt is not connected with the Chicago Taxi Example.
