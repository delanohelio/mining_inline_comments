These options add extra \n+context to fields and schemas. This replaces the current Beam metadata that is present \n+in a FieldType only, options are available in fields and row schemas. Schema options are\n+fully typed and can contain complex rows. *Remark: Schema aware is still experimental.*\n+([BEAM-9035](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9035))\n+* Java SDK: The protobuf extension is fully schema aware and also includes protobuf option\n+conversion to beam schema options. *Remark: Schema aware is still experimental.*\n+([BEAM-9044](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9044))\n+* Added ability to write to BigQuery via Avro file loads (Python) ([BEAM-8841](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-8841))\n+\n+    By default, file loads will be done using JSON, but it is possible to", "originalCommit": "e0f858f852a8b7ab7ede6c0d5e55d4653ea59ccd", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzMTQyNjA4NA==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/11729#discussion_r431426084", "bodyText": "I'll leave it here since this was already in CHANGES.md.", "author": "ibzib", "createdAt": "2020-05-27T20:35:50Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzMTM1ODg3Nw=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}]}
