If we eliminate setting the timer if the user did not specify onWindowExpiration, we are removing the automatic cleanup of windowed user-state for the non global window.\nAre you are concerned about setting the timers if onWindowExpiration was requested for the global window? That is true, but at least the user can work around that by removing the onWindowExpiration annotation and modifying their code. Currently there is no mechanism in the dataflow streaming backend to scan and delivering an onDrain notification for all keys with user state, though that would be possible to add.  Any onDrain mechanism currently would have to be powered by timers set for the end of time, which would have the same issues as the cleanup timer.", "author": "scwhittle", "createdAt": "2020-10-12T18:39:49Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwMzQwMDEzMw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwMzUyNDA2MA==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/13032#discussion_r503524060", "bodyText": "I meant the latter - concerned about setting timers if onWindowExpiration was requested for the global window.\nI meant to imply us implementing some internal onDrain callback just for ParDoFn to receive. The backend would have to store all the keys & windows that need a callback, indeed.
