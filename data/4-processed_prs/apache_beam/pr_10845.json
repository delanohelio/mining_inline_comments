I will pay more attention in the future.\nI think that the version without the prefixes is better for readability and usability arguments, prove me that the version with prefixes is simpler and better and I don't hesitate to change to it, but I am still unconvinced of what we win with the extra prefix vs the extra noise and reduced readability it brings specially when the prefixes are already covered by the general categories.", "author": "iemejia", "createdAt": "2020-02-12T22:20:53Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3ODUzOTY0MQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "2a8db6c1ca8982ecfd9d8b1a2535648672d8f007", "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/2a8db6c1ca8982ecfd9d8b1a2535648672d8f007", "message": "Refine labels/categories for PR autolabeling", "committedDate": "2020-02-12T22:48:14Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "2a8db6c1ca8982ecfd9d8b1a2535648672d8f007", "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/2a8db6c1ca8982ecfd9d8b1a2535648672d8f007", "message": "Refine labels/categories for PR autolabeling", "committedDate": "2020-02-12T22:48:14Z", "type": "forcePushed"}]}
