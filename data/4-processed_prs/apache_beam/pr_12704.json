For example,\n    show(pcoll, n=5000) will read and block until 5000 elements are read.\n\n    collect(pcoll, include_window_info=False) -->\n    collect(pcoll, n='inf', duration='inf', include_window_info=False)\n\n    The collect() command was modified to include a max number of elements and\n    a max duration of elements to read. The collect() command will end when\n    either of the limiters gets triggered, whichever comes first. If a\n    limiter is not supplied it is assumed to be infinite. For example,\n    show(pcoll, n=5000) will read and block until 5000 elements are read.\n\n    head() was removed.\n\nChange-Id: I660b98ac7cd562eb03aab6d15d829eae8726ebad", "committedDate": "2020-09-10T20:12:47Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "6e0837bafdd323416d1b34af210b2f42443f4964", "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/6e0837bafdd323416d1b34af210b2f42443f4964", "message": "Add assertions to 'n' and 'duration' in ib\n\nChange-Id: Ib2f7c2ae0f7ff5afa8e0118bdeee07c9a56019a1", "committedDate": "2020-09-10T20:12:52Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "71d4a90a40f281b7fe7fe91d820c157b6f7f7273", "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/71d4a90a40f281b7fe7fe91d820c157b6f7f7273", "message": "Improve doc strings for collect and show\n\nChange-Id: I15e137430842d4aaa59676eb680296174faf14ee", "committedDate": "2020-09-10T20:12:53Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "71d4a90a40f281b7fe7fe91d820c157b6f7f7273", "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/71d4a90a40f281b7fe7fe91d820c157b6f7f7273", "message": "Improve doc strings for collect and show\n\nChange-Id: I15e137430842d4aaa59676eb680296174faf14ee", "committedDate": "2020-09-10T20:12:53Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5MDQzMTM3Mw==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/12704#discussion_r490431373", "bodyText": "This looks like a likely culprit, the error message in the flakes references a full directory in the cache:\nE                   PermissionError: [WinError 32] The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process: 'D:\\\\a\\\\beam\\\\beam\\\\sdks\\\\python\\\\target\\\\.tox\\\\py35-win\\\\tmp\\\\it-8vh2z7pi2021914046928\\\\full\\\\ac8879590f-2021876280456-2021876278608-2021914046928'", "author": "TheNeuralBit", "createdAt": "2020-09-17T17:22:54Z", "path": "sdks/python/apache_beam/runners/interactive/display/pcoll_visualization.py", "diffHunk": "@@ -407,13 +392,7 @@ def _display_dataframe(self, data, update=None):\n           self._is_datatable_empty = False\n \n   def _to_dataframe(self):\n-    results = []\n-    cache_manager = ie.current_env().get_cache_manager(self._pcoll.pipeline)\n-    if cache_manager.exists('full', self._cache_key):\n-      coder = cache_manager.load_pcoder('full', self._cache_key)\n-      reader, _ = cache_manager.read('full', self._cache_key)\n-      results = list(to_element_list(reader, coder, include_window_info=True))\n-", "originalCommit": "71d4a90a40f281b7fe7fe91d820c157b6f7f7273", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5MDU5MzMwOQ==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/12704#discussion_r490593309", "bodyText": "Probably known issue https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-10627, an AI is https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-10514.
