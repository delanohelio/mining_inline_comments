It relies on\n+  a new, fully-featured transform based on file loads into BigQuery. To revert the behavior to the old implementation,\n+  you may use `--experiments=use_legacy_bq_sink`.\n+* Add cross-language support to Java's JdbcIO, now available in the Python module `apache_beam.io.jdbc` ([BEAM-10135](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-10135), [BEAM-10136](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-10136)).\n+* Add support of AWS SDK v2 for KinesisIO.Read (Java) ([BEAM-9702](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9702)).\n+* Add streaming support to SnowflakeIO in Java SDK ([BEAM-9896](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9896))\n+* Support reading and writing to Google Healthcare DICOM APIs in Python SDK ([BEAM-10601](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-10601))\n+* Add dispositions for SnowflakeIO.write ([BEAM-10343](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-10343))\n+* Add cross-language support to SnowflakeIO.Read now available in the Python module `apache_beam.io.external.snowflake` ([BEAM-9897](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9897)).\n+\n+## New Features / Improvements\n+\n+* Shared library for simplifying management of large shared objects added to Python SDK. Example use case is sharing a large TF model object across threads ([BEAM-10417](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-10417)).\n+* Dataflow streaming timers are not strictly time ordered when set earlier mid-bundle ([BEAM-8543](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-8543)).\n+* OnTimerContext should not create a new one when processing each element/timer in FnApiDoFnRunner ([BEAM-9839](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9839))\n+* Key should be available in @OnTimer methods (Spark Runner) ([BEAM-9850](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9850))\n+\n+## Breaking Changes\n+\n+* WriteToBigQuery transforms now require a GCS location to be provided through either\n+  custom_gcs_temp_location in the constructor of WriteToBigQuery or the fallback option\n+  --temp_location, or pass method=\"STREAMING_INSERTS\" to WriteToBigQuery ([BEAM-6928](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-6928)).\n+", "originalCommit": "b8faa7399f16fcffedaa7d551dade09c38d68b5d", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "222cd448fe0262fcc5557186b58013ec7bf26622", "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/222cd448fe0262fcc5557186b58013ec7bf26622", "message": "Update website/www/site/content/en/blog/beam-2.24.0.md\n\nCo-authored-by: Udi Meiri <udim@users.noreply.github.com>", "committedDate": "2020-09-17T21:53:34Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "222cd448fe0262fcc5557186b58013ec7bf26622", "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/222cd448fe0262fcc5557186b58013ec7bf26622", "message": "Update website/www/site/content/en/blog/beam-2.24.0.md\n\nCo-authored-by: Udi Meiri <udim@users.noreply.github.com>", "committedDate": "2020-09-17T21:53:34Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"oid": "87e8b626bea4d4d6d9af2f59639a509ead383bcf", "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/87e8b626bea4d4d6d9af2f59639a509ead383bcf", "message": "Update day", "committedDate": "2020-09-18T19:31:48Z", "type": "commit"}]}
