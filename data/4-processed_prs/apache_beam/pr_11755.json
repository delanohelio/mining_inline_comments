My understanding is, since we for the most part only run Jenkins cron jobs on head, creating a dummy PR is the best way to test the release branch. I bet it's possible to configure Jenkins cron jobs to run against the release branch instead, but not sure if that would be worth the effort or expense.\nAlso, this list does look out of date (Python 3.6 and 3.7 are conspicuously missing, for example).
