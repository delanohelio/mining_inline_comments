During the pipeline construction, Python SDK\n+  will connect to a Java expansion service to expand these transforms.\n+  To facilitate this, a small amount of setup is needed before using these\n+  transforms in a Beam Python pipeline.\n+\n+  There are several ways to setup cross-language Jdbc transforms.\n+\n+  * Option 1: use the default expansion service\n+  * Option 2: specify a custom expansion service\n+\n+  See below for details regarding each of these options.\n+\n+  *Option 1: Use the default expansion service*\n+\n+  This is the recommended and easiest setup option for using Python Jdbc\n+  transforms. This option is only available for Beam 2.22.0 and later.\n+\n+  This option requires following pre-requisites before running the Beam\n+  pipeline.\n+\n+  * Install Java runtime in the computer from where the pipeline is constructed\n+    and make sure that 'java' command is available.\n+\n+  In this option, Python SDK will either download (for released Beam version) or\n+  build (when running from a Beam Git clone) a expansion service jar and use\n+  that to expand transforms. Currently Jdbc transforms use the\n+  'beam-sdks-java-io-expansion-service' jar for this purpose.\n+\n+  *Option 2: specify a custom expansion service*\n+\n+  In this option, you startup your own expansion service and provide that as\n+  a parameter when using the transforms provided in this module.\n+\n+  This option requires following pre-requisites before running the Beam\n+  pipeline.\n+\n+  * Startup your own expansion service.\n+  * Update your pipeline to provide the expansion service address when\n+    initiating Jdbc transforms provided in this module.\n+\n+  Flink Users can use the built-in Expansion Service of the Flink Runner's\n+  Job Server. If you start Flink's Job Server, the expansion service will be\n+  started on port 8097.

During the pipeline construction, Python SDK\n+  will connect to a Java expansion service to expand these transforms.\n+  To facilitate this, a small amount of setup is needed before using these\n+  transforms in a Beam Python pipeline.\n+\n+  There are several ways to setup cross-language Jdbc transforms.\n+\n+  * Option 1: use the default expansion service\n+  * Option 2: specify a custom expansion service\n+\n+  See below for details regarding each of these options.\n+\n+  *Option 1: Use the default expansion service*\n+\n+  This is the recommended and easiest setup option for using Python Jdbc\n+  transforms. This option is only available for Beam 2.24.0 and later.\n+\n+  This option requires following pre-requisites before running the Beam\n+  pipeline.\n+\n+  * Install Java runtime in the computer from where the pipeline is constructed\n+    and make sure that 'java' command is available.\n+\n+  In this option, Python SDK will either download (for released Beam version) or\n+  build (when running from a Beam Git clone) a expansion service jar and use\n+  that to expand transforms. Currently Jdbc transforms use the\n+  'beam-sdks-java-io-expansion-service' jar for this purpose.\n+\n+  *Option 2: specify a custom expansion service*\n+\n+  In this option, you startup your own expansion service and provide that as\n+  a parameter when using the transforms provided in this module.\n+\n+  This option requires following pre-requisites before running the Beam\n+  pipeline.\n+\n+  * Startup your own expansion service.", "originalCommit": "ccf95a03749d834d039f51832b8f760c7dc5ff68", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ1NjQ1MzUxNw==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/12145#discussion_r456453517", "bodyText": "I added Experimental; no backwards compatibility guarantees. at the end of the docstrings.", "author": "piotr-szuberski", "createdAt": "2020-07-17T13:47:54Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ1NjMyODA4Mg=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "7e5ac84a71cfeaa6d8f3f668e994eddf862e8a9e", "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/7e5ac84a71cfeaa6d8f3f668e994eddf862e8a9e", "message": "[BEAM-10136] Add JdbcIO Write Cross-language transform", "committedDate": "2020-07-17T13:43:35Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "74dcab3f1ed292fd0a3cd68600feb1c01225b3fa", "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/74dcab3f1ed292fd0a3cd68600feb1c01225b3fa", "message": "[BEAM-10135] Add JdbcIO Read Cross-language transform", "committedDate": "2020-07-17T13:43:35Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "5a51cc2a79c210c344deb6074498a01a0cc64dca", "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/5a51cc2a79c210c344deb6074498a01a0cc64dca", "message": "[BEAM-10171] Update the website with JdbcIO cross-language support completed", "committedDate": "2020-07-17T13:54:01Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"oid": "12c2bb80755494d2163c06ff652a7ff5dc102c3d", "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/12c2bb80755494d2163c06ff652a7ff5dc102c3d", "message": "[BEAM-10135][BEAM-10136] Add Python wrapper for Cross-language JdbcIO transforms", "committedDate": "2020-07-17T13:56:30Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "1f51cb4c8e2265543aa250868534f3de78c22db5", "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/1f51cb4c8e2265543aa250868534f3de78c22db5", "message": "[BEAM-10135][BEAM-10136] Add integration tests for JdbcIO python wrapper", "committedDate": "2020-07-17T13:56:34Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "7e7c06f00755a9258c840b02d8c2b613281df87e", "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/7e7c06f00755a9258c840b02d8c2b613281df87e", "message": "[BEAM-10171] Update the website with JdbcIO cross-language support completed", "committedDate": "2020-07-17T13:56:42Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"oid": "c82c6ecfeb6432f59359a1455fc691f500af71ef", "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/c82c6ecfeb6432f59359a1455fc691f500af71ef", "message": "Run Jdbc cross-language tests in postcommit instead of separate gradle task", "committedDate": "2020-07-17T18:27:30Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"oid": "4c4b1577b38269e63d939b2b89e2ee9bba930190", "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/4c4b1577b38269e63d939b2b89e2ee9bba930190", "message": "[BEAM-10135][BEAM-10136] AddJdbcIO python wrapper integration tests to Python postcommit", "committedDate": "2020-07-17T19:44:52Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "62a8342fb8558a4bb29505af83ac263ba5fe052d", "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/62a8342fb8558a4bb29505af83ac263ba5fe052d", "message": "[BEAM-10171] Update the website with JdbcIO cross-language support completed", "committedDate": "2020-07-17T19:45:02Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "62a8342fb8558a4bb29505af83ac263ba5fe052d", "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/62a8342fb8558a4bb29505af83ac263ba5fe052d", "message": "[BEAM-10171] Update the website with JdbcIO cross-language support completed", "committedDate": "2020-07-17T19:45:02Z", "type": "forcePushed"}]}
