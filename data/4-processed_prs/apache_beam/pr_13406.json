What I understand is, i18n directory is naturally offered by the Hugo plugin with the same name and it's used for localizing strings, syntax  {{ i18n \"id here\" }} or {{ T \"id here\" }}. First, I got stuck when I needed to use a loop structure, plus translation together. Then I figured out that data let me to apply a loop structure on it as an array, and i18n helped me to separate directories according to the main language (data/en, data/pl, data/sp, etc.). I know it's a bit annoying to have 2 places, but simply think that one for strings and one for arrays. \ud83d\ude1b", "author": "bntnam", "createdAt": "2020-11-24T04:56:52Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyOTA4Njk0OQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUzMDAzMDAzMQ==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/13406#discussion_r530030031", "bodyText": "Gotcha.
