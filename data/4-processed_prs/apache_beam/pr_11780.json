The ideal choice for printing in any size or using for swags. The lit-up tail is another element to play with if you want to animate the firefly.\n+\n+<img src=\"/images/mascot/beam_mascot_500x500.png\" width=\"200\"/>\n+\n+The adaptation below represents independent learning. The bubble can be replaced by any other description. An ideal choice for promoting Beam talks, workshops, and webinars where the Beam community learns new things.\n+\n+<img src=\"/images/mascot/learning_independently_500x500.png\" width=\"280\"/>\n+\n+The second adaptation below represents data processing. The data goes through the firefly\u2019s tail, filling the entire body with streams of information (for example, codes) and when it is done processing the mascot\u2019s entire body outline lits up in yellow color to tell that it is loaded with data and is ready to process it, while it becomes stronger and faster. Mascot returns to its original status after finishing this process.\n+\n+<img src=\"/images/mascot/big_data_500x500.png\" width=\"300\"/>\n+\n+\n+<!--\n+![Beam Firefly](/images/mascot/beam_mascot_500x500.png =100x)\n+![Learning Independently](/images/mascot/learning_independently_500x500.png =100x)\n+![Processing Big Data](/images/mascot/big_data_500x500.png =100x)\n+-->\n+\n+\n+## Colors\n+For Beam mascot we used Apache Beam project\u2019s predefined colors and fonts.
