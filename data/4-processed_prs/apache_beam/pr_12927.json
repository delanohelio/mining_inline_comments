For example, on my Linux machine:\npip install --force-reinstall fastavro==0.23.6\n\nCollecting fastavro==0.23.6\n  Using cached fastavro-0.23.6-cp37-cp37m-manylinux2010_x86_64.whl (1.4 MB)\n\nls site-packages/fastavro | grep write \n\njson_write.py\n_logical_writers.cpython-37m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so\nlogical_writers.py\n_logical_writers_py.py\n_write.cpython-37m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so   <-- this is the library I'm talking about\nwrite.py\n_write_py.py\n\nI'm pretty sure the same happens on Jenkins and on our users' machines. So how did I catch the bug? That .so library links with libpython3.x.so:\nldd site-packages/fastavro/_write.cpython-37m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so\n\nlinux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffd7abf7000)\nlibpython3.7m.so.1.0 => not found\nlibc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007f8c548e3000)\n/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f8c54d07000)\n\nwhich I didn't have on my machine due to misconfiguration (I already know it's pyenv fault, but this is a different story). That's why the first import statement failed, ImportError was raised, and pure Python version was used instead.\nTo sum up, it is a problem, but the chances that someone will encounter this are pretty low.
