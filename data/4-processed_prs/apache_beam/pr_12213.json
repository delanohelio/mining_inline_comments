This release includes both improvements and new functionality.\n+See the [download page](/get-started/downloads/#2230-2020-07-16) for this release.\n+For more information on changes in 2.23.0, check out the\n+[detailed release notes](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12319527&version=12347145).\n+\n+## Highlights\n+\n+* Twister2 Runner ([BEAM-7304](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-7304)).\n+* Python 3.8 support ([BEAM-8494](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-8494)).\n+\n+## I/Os\n+\n+* Support for reading from Snowflake added (Java) ([BEAM-9722](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9722)).\n+* Support for writing to Splunk added (Java) ([BEAM-8596](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-8596)).\n+* Support for assume role added (Java) ([BEAM-10335](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-10335)).\n+* A new transform to read from BigQuery has been added: `apache_beam.io.gcp.bigquery.ReadFromBigQuery`. This transform\n+  is experimental. It reads data from BigQuery by exporting data to Avro files, and reading those files. It also supports\n+  reading data by exporting to JSON files. This has small differences in behavior for Time and Date-related fields. See\n+  Pydoc for more information.\n+* Add dispositions for SnowflakeIO.write ([BEAM-10343](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-10343))\n+\n+## New Features / Improvements\n+\n+* Update Snowflake JDBC dependency and add application=beam to connection URL ([BEAM-10383](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-10383)).\n+\n+## Breaking Changes\n+\n+* `RowJson.RowJsonDeserializer`, `JsonToRow`, and `PubsubJsonTableProvider` now accept \"implicit\n+  nulls\" by default when deserializing JSON (Java) ([BEAM-10220](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-10220)).\n+  Previously nulls could only be represented with explicit null values, as in\n+  `{\"foo\": \"bar\", \"baz\": null}`, whereas an implicit null like `{\"foo\": \"bar\"}` would raise an\n+  exception. Now both JSON strings will yield the same result by default. This behavior can be\n+  overridden with `RowJson.RowJsonDeserializer#withNullBehavior`.\n+* Fixed a bug in `GroupIntoBatches` experimental transform in Python to actually group batches by key. \n+  This changes the output type for this transform ([BEAM-6696](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-6696)).\n+\n+## Deprecations\n+\n+* Remove Gearpump runner. ([BEAM-9999](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9999))\n+* Remove Apex runner. ([BEAM-9999](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9999))\n+* RedisIO.readAll() is deprecated and will be removed in 2 versions, users must use RedisIO.readKeyPatterns() as a replacement ([BEAM-9747](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9747)).\n+\n+## Known Issues", "originalCommit": "904484fef58c24e117040f1e2536369c4dedbd78", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "7660bd444ebd0d545ed865a463c35cb963c802ab", "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/7660bd444ebd0d545ed865a463c35cb963c802ab", "message": "Add a blogpost for Apache Beam 2.23.0.", "committedDate": "2020-07-29T19:53:13Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "df94d8ff27f532036c1932755c377cd91c7cd59b", "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/df94d8ff27f532036c1932755c377cd91c7cd59b", "message": "Add a placeholder for date", "committedDate": "2020-07-29T19:54:46Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "e9ea9f41893cf653b8620b5a401f6ff3b6fda26d", "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/e9ea9f41893cf653b8620b5a401f6ff3b6fda26d", "message": "Update release dates and contributor list to account for cherry-picked issues.", "committedDate": "2020-07-29T19:55:07Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "e9ea9f41893cf653b8620b5a401f6ff3b6fda26d", "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/e9ea9f41893cf653b8620b5a401f6ff3b6fda26d", "message": "Update release dates and contributor list to account for cherry-picked issues.", "committedDate": "2020-07-29T19:55:07Z", "type": "forcePushed"}]}
