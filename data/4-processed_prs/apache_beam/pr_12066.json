The Beam model doesn't have Side Outputs, it has multiple or Additional Outputs. https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#additional-outputs\nI'd recommend going with Additional Outputs, which is in the programing guide, and the godoc. https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/apache/beam/sdks/go/pkg/beam?tab=doc#hdr-Additional_Outputs\nSide Inputs exist distinctly since they don't drive parallel execution, and behave very differently than PCollections used for Parallel input.\nEach output however produces a different PCollection, and that's about it. Also calling them Side Outputs ascribes extra semantics that don't exist.", "author": "lostluck", "createdAt": "2020-06-26T17:41:31Z", "path": "learning/katas/go/Core Transforms/Side Output/Side Output/task.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,50 @@\n+<!--\n+  ~ Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\n+  ~ or more contributor license agreements.

Consider removing the paranthetical, I don't think it adds anything.\nDoFns in BeamGo don't have a \"main\" output, and we do not use that term in the GoDoc (which has problems, but this isn't one of them). They have the first, second, third etc outputs. DoFn return outputs only have two properties, if present, they're always the first one, and they require the DoFn to always return an element (or abort with an error).", "author": "lostluck", "createdAt": "2020-06-26T18:03:53Z", "path": "learning/katas/go/Core Transforms/Side Output/Side Output/task.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,50 @@\n+<!--\n+  ~ Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\n+  ~ or more contributor license agreements.
