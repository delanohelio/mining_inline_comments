I got some feedback on it both ways, but ultimately I didn't really like that approach because it's a bit unintuitive for users to get a different RTracker type than what they created. Documentation would have to do some extra legwork. Plus, it goes against the trend in Go to have users understand what's happening with concurrency.\nBut anyway, I'm open to that approach and may pivot to it if it makes sense, but for now the plan is, when we add dynamic splitting, to provide a concurrency wrapper and have users wrap their RTrackers themselves, or just write their own concurrency. (This is apparently also the way python does it, so it's not completely unprecedented.)", "author": "youngoli", "createdAt": "2020-03-24T05:58:22Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5NjgwMzI0OQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5NjgwNDE0Mw==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/11188#discussion_r396804143", "bodyText": "returns nil*", "author": "lostluck", "createdAt": "2020-03-23T22:52:12Z", "path": "sdks/go/pkg/beam/core/sdf/sdf.go", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,74 @@\n+// Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more\n+// contributor license agreements.
