The calculation of backlog bytes should\nalways take into account the time that the record was inserted into\nKinesis as this gives accurate results which are independent of\ncurrent processing time or any other conditions that reader watermark\ncan be using. Therefore a separate, fixed policy is used to track\nprocessed records for the backlog calculation.", "committedDate": "2020-04-10T11:19:10Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyMTU4ODY2Mg==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/11377#discussion_r421588662", "bodyText": "Why AtomicReference no more used here?", "author": "aromanenko-dev", "createdAt": "2020-05-07T15:20:40Z", "path": "sdks/java/io/kinesis/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/kinesis/ShardRecordsIterator.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -43,22 +42,23 @@\n   private final RecordFilter filter;\n   private final String streamName;\n   private final String shardId;\n-  private AtomicReference<ShardCheckpoint> checkpoint;\n+  private final AtomicReference<ShardCheckpoint> checkpoint;\n+  private final WatermarkPolicy watermarkPolicy;", "originalCommit": "1e182c6abc8e265f3e4b670747d448df70bb7bb0", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyMTc0MDM3Mw==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/11377#discussion_r421740373", "bodyText": "I don't know why it was used in the first place, maybe it was some leftover after some previous changes to the code.
