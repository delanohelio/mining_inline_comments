The feature lets you convert a PCollection to a DataFrame and then interact with the DataFrame using the standard methods available on the Pandas DataFrame API. The DataFrame API is built on top of the Pandas implementation, and Pandas DataFrame methods are invoked on subsets of the datasets in parallel. The big difference between Beam DataFrames and Pandas DataFrames is that operations are deferred by the Beam API, to support the Beam parallel processing model.\n+\n+You can think of Beam DataFrames as a domain-specific language (DSL) for Beam pipelines. Similar to [Beam SQL](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/dsls/sql/overview/), DataFrames is a DSL built into the Beam Python SDK. Using this DSL, you can create pipelines without referencing standard Beam constructs like [ParDo](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/transforms/python/elementwise/pardo/) or [CombinePerKey](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/transforms/python/aggregation/combineperkey/).\n+\n+The Beam DataFrame API is intended to provide access to a familiar programming interface within a Beam pipeline. In some cases, the DataFrame API can also improve pipeline efficiency by deferring to the highly efficient, vectorized Pandas implementation.\n+\n+## What is a DataFrame?\n+\n+If you\u2019re new to Pandas DataFrames, you can get started by reading [10 minutes to pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html), which shows you how to import and work with the `pandas` package. Pandas is an open-source Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures that simplify working with relational or labeled data. One of these data structures is the [DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html), which contains two-dimensional tabular data and provides labeled rows and columns for the data.\n+\n+## Using DataFrames\n+\n+To use Beam DataFrames, you need to install Apache Beam version 2.26.0 or higher (for complete setup instructions, see the [Apache Beam Python SDK Quickstart](https://beam.apache.org/get-started/quickstart-py/)) and Pandas version 1.0 or higher. You can use DataFrames as shown in the following example, which reads New York City taxi data from a CSV file, performs a grouped aggregation, and writes the output back to CSV. Note that this example processes a large dataset and should be run in a distributed environment:\n+\n+{{< highlight py >}}\n+from apache_beam.dataframe.io import read_csv\n+\n+with beam.Pipeline() as p:\n+  df = p | read_csv(\"gs://apache-beam-samples/nyc_taxi/misc/sample.csv\")\n+  agg = df[['passenger_count', 'DOLocationID']].groupby('DOLocationID').sum()\n+  agg.to_csv('output')\n+{{< /highlight >}}\n+\n+Pandas is able to infer column names from the first row of the CSV data, which is where `passenger_count` and `DOLocationID` come from.\n+\n+In this example, the only traditional Beam type is the `Pipeline` instance. Otherwise the example is written completely with the DataFrame API. This is possible because the Beam DataFrame API includes its own IO operations (for example, `read_csv` and `to_csv`) based on the Pandas native implementations. `read_*` and `to_*` operations support file patterns and any Beam-compatible file system. The grouping is accomplished with a group-by-key, and arbitrary Pandas operations (in this case, `sum`) can be applied before the final write that occurs with `to_csv`.\n+\n+The Beam DataFrame API aims to be compatible with the native Pandas implementation, with a few caveats detailed below in [Differences from standard Pandas]({{< ref \"#differences_from_standard_pandas\" >}}).\n+\n+## Embedding DataFrames in a pipeline\n+\n+To use the DataFrames API in a larger pipeline, you can convert a PCollection to a DataFrame, process the DataFrame, and then convert the DataFrame back to a PCollection. In order to convert a PCollection to a DataFrame and back, you have to use PCollections that have [schemas](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#what-is-a-schema) attached. A PCollection with a schema attached is also referred to as a *schema-aware PCollection*.

The feature lets you convert a PCollection to a DataFrame and then interact with the DataFrame using the standard methods available on the Pandas DataFrame API. The DataFrame API is built on top of the Pandas implementation, and Pandas DataFrame methods are invoked on subsets of the datasets in parallel. The big difference between Beam DataFrames and Pandas DataFrames is that operations are deferred by the Beam API, to support the Beam parallel processing model.\n+\n+You can think of Beam DataFrames as a domain-specific language (DSL) for Beam pipelines. Similar to [Beam SQL](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/dsls/sql/overview/), DataFrames is a DSL built into the Beam Python SDK. Using this DSL, you can create pipelines without referencing standard Beam constructs like [ParDo](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/transforms/python/elementwise/pardo/) or [CombinePerKey](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/transforms/python/aggregation/combineperkey/).\n+\n+The Beam DataFrame API is intended to provide access to a familiar programming interface within a Beam pipeline. In some cases, the DataFrame API can also improve pipeline efficiency by deferring to the highly efficient, vectorized Pandas implementation.\n+\n+## What is a DataFrame?\n+\n+If you\u2019re new to Pandas DataFrames, you can get started by reading [10 minutes to pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html), which shows you how to import and work with the `pandas` package. Pandas is an open-source Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures that simplify working with relational or labeled data. One of these data structures is the [DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html), which contains two-dimensional tabular data and provides labeled rows and columns for the data.\n+\n+## Using DataFrames\n+\n+To use Beam DataFrames, you need to install Apache Beam version 2.26.0 or higher (for complete setup instructions, see the [Apache Beam Python SDK Quickstart](https://beam.apache.org/get-started/quickstart-py/)) and Pandas version 1.0 or higher. You can use DataFrames as shown in the following example, which reads New York City taxi data from a CSV file, performs a grouped aggregation, and writes the output back to CSV. Note that this example processes a large dataset and should be run in a distributed environment:\n+\n+{{< highlight py >}}\n+from apache_beam.dataframe.io import read_csv\n+\n+with beam.Pipeline() as p:\n+  df = p | read_csv(\"gs://apache-beam-samples/nyc_taxi/misc/sample.csv\")\n+  agg = df[['passenger_count', 'DOLocationID']].groupby('DOLocationID').sum()\n+  agg.to_csv('output')\n+{{< /highlight >}}\n+\n+Pandas is able to infer column names from the first row of the CSV data, which is where `passenger_count` and `DOLocationID` come from.\n+\n+In this example, the only traditional Beam type is the `Pipeline` instance. Otherwise the example is written completely with the DataFrame API. This is possible because the Beam DataFrame API includes its own IO operations (for example, `read_csv` and `to_csv`) based on the Pandas native implementations. `read_*` and `to_*` operations support file patterns and any Beam-compatible file system. The grouping is accomplished with a group-by-key, and arbitrary Pandas operations (in this case, `sum`) can be applied before the final write that occurs with `to_csv`.\n+\n+The Beam DataFrame API aims to be compatible with the native Pandas implementation, with a few caveats detailed below in [Differences from standard Pandas]({{< ref \"#differences_from_standard_pandas\" >}}).\n+\n+## Embedding DataFrames in a pipeline\n+\n+To use the DataFrames API in a larger pipeline, you can convert a PCollection to a DataFrame, process the DataFrame, and then convert the DataFrame back to a PCollection. In order to convert a PCollection to a DataFrame and back, you have to use PCollections that have [schemas](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#what-is-a-schema) attached. A PCollection with a schema attached is also referred to as a *schema-aware PCollection*.

The DataFrame API is built on top of the Pandas implementation, and Pandas DataFrame methods are invoked on subsets of the datasets in parallel. The big difference between Beam DataFrames and Pandas DataFrames is that operations are deferred by the Beam API, to support the Beam parallel processing model.\n+\n+You can think of Beam DataFrames as a domain-specific language (DSL) for Beam pipelines. Similar to [Beam SQL](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/dsls/sql/overview/), DataFrames is a DSL built into the Beam Python SDK. Using this DSL, you can create pipelines without referencing standard Beam constructs like [ParDo](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/transforms/python/elementwise/pardo/) or [CombinePerKey](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/transforms/python/aggregation/combineperkey/).\n+\n+The Beam DataFrame API is intended to provide access to a familiar programming interface within a Beam pipeline. In some cases, the DataFrame API can also improve pipeline efficiency by deferring to the highly efficient, vectorized Pandas implementation.\n+\n+## What is a DataFrame?\n+\n+If you\u2019re new to Pandas DataFrames, you can get started by reading [10 minutes to pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html), which shows you how to import and work with the `pandas` package. Pandas is an open-source Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures that simplify working with relational or labeled data. One of these data structures is the [DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html), which contains two-dimensional tabular data and provides labeled rows and columns for the data.\n+\n+## Using DataFrames\n+\n+To use Beam DataFrames, you need to install Apache Beam version 2.26.0 or higher (for complete setup instructions, see the [Apache Beam Python SDK Quickstart](https://beam.apache.org/get-started/quickstart-py/)) and Pandas version 1.0 or higher. You can use DataFrames as shown in the following example, which reads New York City taxi data from a CSV file, performs a grouped aggregation, and writes the output back to CSV. Note that this example processes a large dataset and should be run in a distributed environment:\n+\n+{{< highlight py >}}\n+from apache_beam.dataframe.io import read_csv\n+\n+with beam.Pipeline() as p:\n+  df = p | read_csv(\"gs://apache-beam-samples/nyc_taxi/misc/sample.csv\")\n+  agg = df[['passenger_count', 'DOLocationID']].groupby('DOLocationID').sum()\n+  agg.to_csv('output')\n+{{< /highlight >}}\n+\n+Pandas is able to infer column names from the first row of the CSV data, which is where `passenger_count` and `DOLocationID` come from.\n+\n+In this example, the only traditional Beam type is the `Pipeline` instance. Otherwise the example is written completely with the DataFrame API. This is possible because the Beam DataFrame API includes its own IO operations (for example, `read_csv` and `to_csv`) based on the Pandas native implementations. `read_*` and `to_*` operations support file patterns and any Beam-compatible file system. The grouping is accomplished with a group-by-key, and arbitrary Pandas operations (in this case, `sum`) can be applied before the final write that occurs with `to_csv`.\n+\n+The Beam DataFrame API aims to be compatible with the native Pandas implementation, with a few caveats detailed below in [Differences from standard Pandas]({{< ref \"#differences_from_standard_pandas\" >}}).\n+\n+## Embedding DataFrames in a pipeline\n+\n+To use the DataFrames API in a larger pipeline, you can convert a PCollection to a DataFrame, process the DataFrame, and then convert the DataFrame back to a PCollection. In order to convert a PCollection to a DataFrame and back, you have to use PCollections that have [schemas](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#what-is-a-schema) attached. A PCollection with a schema attached is also referred to as a *schema-aware PCollection*. To learn more about attaching a schema to a PCollection, see [Creating schemas](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#creating-schemas).\n+\n+Here\u2019s an example that creates a schema-aware PCollection, converts it to a DataFrame using `to_dataframe`, processes the DataFrame, and then converts the DataFrame back to a PCollection using `to_pcollection`:\n+\n+{{< highlight py >}}\n+from apache_beam.dataframe.convert import to_dataframe\n+from apache_beam.dataframe.convert import to_pcollection\n+...\n+    # Read the text file[pattern] into a PCollection.\n+    lines = p | 'Read' >> ReadFromText(known_args.input)\n+\n+    words = (\n+        lines\n+        | 'Split' >> beam.FlatMap(\n+            lambda line: re.findall(r'[\\w]+', line)).with_output_types(str)\n+        # Map to Row objects to generate a schema suitable for conversion\n+        # to a dataframe.\n+        | 'ToRows' >> beam.Map(lambda word: beam.Row(word=word)))\n+\n+    df = to_dataframe(words)\n+    df['count'] = 1\n+    counted = df.groupby('word').sum()\n+    counted.to_csv(known_args.output)\n+\n+    # Deferred DataFrames can also be converted back to schema'd PCollections\n+    counted_pc = to_pcollection(counted, include_indexes=True)\n+\n+    # Do something with counted_pc\n+    ...\n+{{< /highlight >}}\n+\n+You can [see the full example on GitHub](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/wordcount_dataframe.py).\n+\n+It\u2019s also possible to use the DataFrame API by passing a function to `DataframeTransform`:\n+\n+{{< highlight py >}}\n+from apache_beam.dataframe.transforms import DataframeTransform\n+\n+with beam.Pipeline() as p:\n+  ...\n+  | beam.Select(trip_distance=lambda line: float(..),\n+                passenger_count=lambda line: int(..))\n+  | DataframeTransform(lambda df: df[['passenger_count', 'trip_distance']].groupby('passenger_count').sum())\n+  | beam.Map(lambda row: f\"{row.passenger_count}: {row.trip_distance}\")\n+  ...\n+{{< /highlight >}}\n+\n+`DataframeTransform` is similar to `SqlTransform` from the [Beam SQL](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/dsls/sql/overview/) DSL. Where `SqlTransform` translates a SQL query to a PTransform, `DataframeTransform` is a PTransform that applies a function that takes and returns DataFrames. A `DataframeTransform` can be particularly useful if you have a stand-alone function that can be called both on Beam and on ordinary Pandas DataFrames.\n+\n+`DataframeTransform` can accept and return multiple PCollections by name and by keyword, as shown in the following examples:\n+\n+{{< highlight py >}}\n+output = (pc1, pc2) | DataframeTransform(lambda df1, df2: ...)\n+\n+output = {'a': pc, ...} | DataframeTransform(lambda a, ...: ...)\n+\n+pc1, pc2 = {'a': pc} | DataframeTransform(lambda a: expr1, expr2)\n+\n+{...} = {a: pc} | DataframeTransform(lambda a: {...})\n+{{< /highlight >}}\n+\n+## Differences from standard Pandas {#differences_from_standard_pandas}\n+\n+The Beam DataFrames API is deferred, like the rest of the Beam API. As a result, there are some limitations on what you can do with Beam DataFrames, compared to the standard Pandas implementation:\n+\n+* Because all operations are deferred, the result of a given operation may not be available for control flow. For example, you can compute a sum, but you can't branch on the result.\n+* Result columns must be computable without access to the data. For example, you can\u2019t use [transpose](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.transpose.html).\n+* PCollections in Beam are inherently unordered, so Pandas operations that are sensitive to the ordering of rows are unsupported.\n+\n+With Beam DataFrames, computation doesn\u2019t take place until the pipeline runs. Before that, only the shape or schema of the result is known, meaning that you can work with the names and types of the columns, but not the result data itself.\n+\n+There are a few common exceptions you may see when attempting to use certain Pandas operations:\n+\n+* **WontImplementError**: Indicates that this is an operation or argument that isn\u2019t supported because it\u2019s incompatible with the Beam model. The largest class of operations that raise this error are operations that are order sensitive, such as [shift](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.shift.html), [cummax](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.cummax.html), [cummin](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.cummin.html), [head](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.head.html), and [tail](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.tail.html#pandas.DataFrame.tail). These cannot be trivially mapped to Beam because PCollections, representing distributed datasets, are unordered.\n+* **NotImplementedError**: Indicates this is an operation or argument that hasn\u2019t been implemented yet. Many Pandas operations are already available through Beam DataFrames, but there\u2019s still a long tail of unimplemented operations.\n+* **NonParallelOperation**: Indicates that you\u2019re attempting a non-parallel operation outside of an `allow_non_parallel_operations` block. Some operations don't lend themselves to parallel computation. They can still be used, but must be guarded:\n+```py\n+with beam.dataframe.allow_non_parallel_operations(True):\n+  ...\n+```", "originalCommit": "107ccc76f22b5bed96aa51b0c789b979aa44db54", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0NTEzNzg5Ng==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/13560#discussion_r545137896", "bodyText": "Ya, that reads much better.

The feature lets you convert a PCollection to a DataFrame and then interact with the DataFrame using the standard methods available on the Pandas DataFrame API. The DataFrame API is built on top of the Pandas implementation, and Pandas DataFrame methods are invoked on subsets of the datasets in parallel. The big difference between Beam DataFrames and Pandas DataFrames is that operations are deferred by the Beam API, to support the Beam parallel processing model.\n+\n+You can think of Beam DataFrames as a domain-specific language (DSL) for Beam pipelines. Similar to [Beam SQL](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/dsls/sql/overview/), DataFrames is a DSL built into the Beam Python SDK. Using this DSL, you can create pipelines without referencing standard Beam constructs like [ParDo](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/transforms/python/elementwise/pardo/) or [CombinePerKey](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/transforms/python/aggregation/combineperkey/).\n+\n+The Beam DataFrame API is intended to provide access to a familiar programming interface within a Beam pipeline. In some cases, the DataFrame API can also improve pipeline efficiency by deferring to the highly efficient, vectorized Pandas implementation.\n+\n+## What is a DataFrame?\n+\n+If you\u2019re new to Pandas DataFrames, you can get started by reading [10 minutes to pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html), which shows you how to import and work with the `pandas` package. Pandas is an open-source Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures that simplify working with relational or labeled data. One of these data structures is the [DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html), which contains two-dimensional tabular data and provides labeled rows and columns for the data.\n+\n+## Using DataFrames\n+\n+To use Beam DataFrames, you need to install Apache Beam version 2.26.0 or higher (for complete setup instructions, see the [Apache Beam Python SDK Quickstart](https://beam.apache.org/get-started/quickstart-py/)) and Pandas version 1.0 or higher. You can use DataFrames as shown in the following example, which reads New York City taxi data from a CSV file, performs a grouped aggregation, and writes the output back to CSV. Note that this example processes a large dataset and should be run in a distributed environment:\n+\n+{{< highlight py >}}\n+from apache_beam.dataframe.io import read_csv\n+\n+with beam.Pipeline() as p:\n+  df = p | read_csv(\"gs://apache-beam-samples/nyc_taxi/misc/sample.csv\")\n+  agg = df[['passenger_count', 'DOLocationID']].groupby('DOLocationID').sum()\n+  agg.to_csv('output')\n+{{< /highlight >}}\n+\n+Pandas is able to infer column names from the first row of the CSV data, which is where `passenger_count` and `DOLocationID` come from.\n+\n+In this example, the only traditional Beam type is the `Pipeline` instance. Otherwise the example is written completely with the DataFrame API. This is possible because the Beam DataFrame API includes its own IO operations (for example, `read_csv` and `to_csv`) based on the Pandas native implementations. `read_*` and `to_*` operations support file patterns and any Beam-compatible file system. The grouping is accomplished with a group-by-key, and arbitrary Pandas operations (in this case, `sum`) can be applied before the final write that occurs with `to_csv`.\n+\n+The Beam DataFrame API aims to be compatible with the native Pandas implementation, with a few caveats detailed below in [Differences from standard Pandas]({{< ref \"#differences_from_standard_pandas\" >}}).\n+\n+## Embedding DataFrames in a pipeline\n+\n+To use the DataFrames API in a larger pipeline, you can convert a PCollection to a DataFrame, process the DataFrame, and then convert the DataFrame back to a PCollection. In order to convert a PCollection to a DataFrame and back, you have to use PCollections that have [schemas](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#what-is-a-schema) attached.
