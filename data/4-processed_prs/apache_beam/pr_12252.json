Guide](/documentation/programming-guide/#combine).\n \n ## Examples\n-See [BEAM-7390](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-7390) for updates. \n \n-## Related transforms \n+In the following examples, we create a pipeline with a `PCollection` of produce.\n+Then, we apply `CombineGlobally` in multiple ways to combine all the elements in the `PCollection`.\n+\n+`CombineGlobally` accepts a function that takes a list of elements as an input, and combines them to return a single element.\n+\n+### Example 1: Combining with a function\n+\n+We define a function `get_common_items` which takes a list of sets as an input, and calculates the intersection (common items) of those sets.\n+\n+{{< highlight py >}}\n+{{< code_sample \"sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/snippets/transforms/aggregation/combineglobally.py\" combineglobally_function >}}\n+{{< /highlight >}}\n+\n+{{< paragraph class=\"notebook-skip\" >}}\n+Output `PCollection` after `CombineGlobally`:\n+{{< /paragraph >}}\n+\n+{{< highlight class=\"notebook-skip\" >}}\n+{{< code_sample

to `CombineGlobally`.\n+They are passed as additional positional arguments or keyword arguments to the function.\n+\n+In this example, the lambda function takes `sets` and `exclude` as arguments.\n+\n+{{< highlight py >}}\n+{{< code_sample \"sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/snippets/transforms/aggregation/combineglobally.py\" combineglobally_multiple_arguments >}}\n+{{< /highlight

value, such as the average from another computation,\n+passing the `PCollection` as a *singleton* accesses that value.\n+\n+In this example, we pass a `PCollection` the value `'\ud83e\udd55'` as a singleton.\n+We then use that value to exclude specific items.\n+\n+{{< highlight py >}}\n+{{< code_sample \"sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/snippets/transforms/aggregation/combineglobally.py\"

the `PCollection` has multiple values, pass the `PCollection` as an *iterator*.\n+This accesses elements lazily as they are needed,\n+so it is possible to iterate over large `PCollection`s that won't fit into memory.\n+\n+{{< highlight py >}}\n+{{< code_sample \"sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/snippets/transforms/aggregation/combineglobally.py\" combineglobally_side_inputs_iter >}}\n+{{<

but this requires that all the elements fit into memory.\n+\n+### Example 6: Combining with side inputs as dictionaries\n+\n+If a `PCollection` is small enough to fit into memory, then that `PCollection` can be passed as a *dictionary*.\n+Each element must be a `(key, value)` pair.\n+Note that all the elements of the `PCollection` must fit into memory for this.\n+If the `PCollection` won't fit into memory, use `beam.pvalue.AsIter(pcollection)` instead.\n+\n+{{< highlight py >}}\n+{{< code_sample

[`CombineFn.add_input()`](https://beam.apache.org/releases/pydoc/current/apache_beam.transforms.core.html#apache_beam.transforms.core.CombineFn.add_input):\n+  Called *once per element*.\n+  Takes an
