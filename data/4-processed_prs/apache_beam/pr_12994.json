On complete_work_status received (by the work progress updater thread), abort the corresponding map task executor thread.  This relies on Thread.interrupt() to unblock the worker thread if blocked and raise an exception -- the exception is actually ignored by the backend since the backend already decided to abort this thread.  Must also check the current thread for interrupts in the valuesiterator when it consumes a stream of values behind the same key, else control does not return to the runReadLoop() to check the interruption.", "committedDate": "2020-10-01T20:55:00Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "42a4957793a9d49d50c6da4ab9ea05a2a4fdbdf9", "url":
