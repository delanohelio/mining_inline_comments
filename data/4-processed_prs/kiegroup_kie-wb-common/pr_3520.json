In AbstractDiagramEditorMenuSessionItems.setEnable we clearly invoke setUndoRedoCommandDisabled. Both are handling menu items accessibility.\nHowever we are facing here wrong architecture from my point of view. as setEnable is parameterized with a boolean parameter. I find it as non intuitive. We handle accessibility for most menu items in setEnable however for some of them we ignore the boolean parameter and just disable them.\nThis 'always disable' caused RHDM-1458. That is why I think this moving [1] from AbstractDiagramEditorMenuSessionItems#setEnabled to AbstractDiagramEditorMenuSessionItems#populateItems could be more proper way to fix this issue.\nI can not invest more time to this investigation. Will take me a lot of time to write automated UI test to verify this PR.\n[1]\nsetItemEnabled(UndoSessionCommand.class, false);\nsetItemEnabled(RedoSessionCommand.class, false);", "author": "jomarko", "createdAt": "2021-01-20T13:14:00Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU1MzE3MjE0NA=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "2f6490bddbb985e9823007baffafa21649ae4a54", "url": "https://github.com/kiegroup/kie-wb-common/commit/2f6490bddbb985e9823007baffafa21649ae4a54", "message": "RHDM-1458: [DMN Designer] Multiple DRDs support - The undo/read are lost when user changes between diagrams", "committedDate": "2021-01-19T12:54:35Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"oid": "5fee9f438af499d3302ad94028ab53ad1ae1ee2c", "url": "https://github.com/kiegroup/kie-wb-common/commit/5fee9f438af499d3302ad94028ab53ad1ae1ee2c", "message": "RHDM-1458: [DMN Designer] Multiple DRDs support - The undo/read are lost when user changes between diagrams", "committedDate": "2021-01-21T19:36:09Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "5fee9f438af499d3302ad94028ab53ad1ae1ee2c", "url": "https://github.com/kiegroup/kie-wb-common/commit/5fee9f438af499d3302ad94028ab53ad1ae1ee2c", "message": "RHDM-1458: [DMN Designer] Multiple DRDs support - The undo/read are lost when user changes between diagrams", "committedDate": "2021-01-21T19:36:09Z", "type": "forcePushed"}]}
