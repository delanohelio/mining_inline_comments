Fixed JDBC thin client SELECT hangs under 2.8.0\n+* Fixed Cache stopping on supplier during rebalance causes NPE and supplying failure.\n+* Fixed Node stops on type mismatch error between index type and type of value from searched row\n+* Fixed SQL: local queries cursors must be closed or full read to unlock the GridH2Table.\n+* Fixed Pages leak suspicion in PDS\n+* Fixed Dynamic SQL index recreate after cache clear may result in AssertionError or JVM crash\n+* Fixed An empty cluster falls if wal segment size small\n+* Fixed SQL: H2Connection leaks on INSERT\n+* Fixed Scan query/iterator on a replicated cache may get wrong results\n+* Fixed Cluster restart may lead to cluster activation error\n+* Fixed Long exchange on deactivation process\n+* Fixed NullPointerException is thrown by ExchangeLatchManager during cache creation\n+* Fixed Memory leak on unstable topology caused by partition reservation\n+* Fixed Fix consistency issues for atomic and mixed tx-atomic cache groups.\n+* Fixed Intermittent [Failed to notify direct custom event listener] exception on node shutdown\n+* Fixed IllegalArgumentException on activation of LogExporterSpi\n+* Fixed NPE while initializing Cassandra Store\n+* Fixed Node leave may cause NullPointerException during IO message processing if security is enabled\n+* Fixed Continuously generated thread dumps in failure processor slow down the whole system\n+* Fixed Metric exporter implementation could lead to NullPointerException from gauge which invoke communication\n+* Fixed Query annotations are not working if statement keywords are in lower case\n+* Fixed SQL: Potential race on MapResult close.\n+* Fixed MetricRegistryMBean doesn't show histogram values in case when histogram name contains underscore character\n+*

stop\n+* Fixed MetricRegistryMBean and OpenCensusExporterSpi have memory leak\n+* Fixed Incorrect rewriting wal record type in marshalled mode during iteration\n+* Fixed Java thin client: Wrong typeId generation for system types\n+* Fixed Affinity cache for version of last server event can be wiped from history\n+* Fixed Destroy of big cache which is not only cache in cache group causes IgniteOOME\n+* Fixed Partition desync if a partition is evicted then owned again and historically rebalanced\n+* Fixed MERGE INTO query is failing on Ignite client node\n+* Fixed H2Tree goes into illegal state when non-indexed columns are dropped\n+* Fixed Can't set serialized enum to a BinaryObject's field\n+* Fixed Prevent partitions owned by other nodes switch their state to MOVING due to counter difference on node join.\n+* Fixed Some of rentingFutures in GridDhtPartitionTopologyImpl may accumulate a huge number of eviction callbacks\n+* Fixed It is needed to set used cache for Spring Data dynamically\n+* Fixed Inconsistency between cache data and indexes when cache operation is interrupted\n+* Fixed MetricRegistryMBean is not thread safe\n+* Fixed Update of partition's states can stuck when rebalance completed during exchange\n+* Fixed Non-comparable keys for eviction policy cause failure handle and node shutdown\n+* Fixed Historical (WAL) rebalance can start on a cleared
