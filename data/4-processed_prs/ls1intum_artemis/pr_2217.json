All student information will not be displayed to the assessors.\n+- The \u00b4*Tutor Exam dashboard* provides an overview over the current assessment progress per exercise. For each exercise, you can view how many submissions have already been assessed and how many are still left. The status of the student complaints is also displayed here. \n+\n+    - **Hint:** To check for plagiarism, you must navigate to the individual exercise. This can be done by navigating to:\n+\n+     *Exam Management* -> *Exercise Groups* -> *View* on the specific exercise.\n+\n+     At the bottom of the page you will find the option ``check for plagiarism``.\n+\n+.. figure:: instructor/tutor_dashboard.png\n+   :alt: Tutor Exam Dashboard\n+   :align: center\n+\n+   Tutor Exam Dashboard\n+\n+- To assess a submission for an exercise, you can click on ``Exercise Dashboard``.\n+- First you must go through the example submissions and assessments to review how a specific exercise should be evaluated. \n+- If there is a submission which has not been assessed yet, you can click ``Start new assessment``. This will fetch a random student submission of this exercise which you can then assess.\n+- Programming exercises are graded automatically but if ``manual assessment`` is allowed, see `Add Exercises`_, you can review and enhance the automatic results. \n+\n+.. figure:: instructor/programming_assessment.png\n+   :alt: Programming Submission Assessment\n+   :align: center\n+\n+   Manually Assessing a Programming Submission\n+\n+- Quiz exercises are graded automatically via the student exam page, see `Manage Student Exams`_, and therefore do not appear in the *Tutor Exam Dashboard*.\n+- Students can complain about their results during the :ref:`student review <student_review>` period. You can evaluate these complaints also in the *Tutor Exam Dashboard*. \n+- The original assessor may not respond to the complaint about his assessment, this must be done by a second assessor. \n+\n+Exam Scores\n+^^^^^^^^^^^\n+- You can view the exam scores from the *Scores* page. This view aggregates the results of the students and combines them to provide an overview over the students\u2019 performance. \n+- You can view the spread between different achieved scores, the average results per exercise as well as the individual students' results.\n+- Additionally, you can choose to modify the dataset by selecting ``only include submitted exams`` or ``only include exercises with at least one non-empty submission``.\n+- The exam scores can also be exported via ``Export Results as CSV``.\n+\n+.. figure:: instructor/exam_statistics.png\n+   :alt: Exam Scores page\n+   :align: center\n+\n+   Exam Scores Page\n+\n+Conducting Test Runs\n+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n+- Test runs are designed to offer the instructors confidence that the :ref:`exam conduction <exam_conduction>` will run smoothly. They allow you to experience the exam from the student\u2019s perspective. A ``test run`` is distinct from a ``student exam`` and is not taken into consideration during the calculation of the exam scores. \n+- You can manage your test runs from the *Test Run* page.\n+- To create a new test run you can press ``Create a Test Run``. This will open a modal where you can select an exercise for each exercise group. You can also set the ``working time``. A test run will have as many exercises, as there are exercise groups. It does not take the ``number of exercises`` set in the exam configuration under consideration.\n+\n+    - **Hint:** Exercise groups with no exercises are ignored.\n+\n+- When you start the test run, you conduct the exam similar to how a student would. You can create submissions for the different exercises and end the test run. \n+- An instructor can also assess his test run submissions. To do this, you must have completed at least one test run. To navigate to the assessment screen of the test runs click ``Assess your Test Runs``. \n+\n+    - **Hint:** Only the creator of the test run is able to assess his submissions.\n+\n+- You can view the results of the assessment of the test run by clicking on ``Summary``. This page simulates the *Student Exam Summary* where the students can view their submissions and the results once they are published. \n+- Here instructors can also use the ``complaint`` feature and respond to it to conclude the full  :ref:`exam timeline <timeline>`.", "originalCommit": "1e1a10137117056dbcb8ee4ab4c8990de3d3f12c", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "ae12cea8040adb437a8590c9677b617ac887986e", "url": "https://github.com/ls1intum/Artemis/commit/ae12cea8040adb437a8590c9677b617ac887986e", "message": "Add feedback from Jan-Philipp to feature overview", "committedDate": "2020-10-19T15:01:13Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "b09ca4cec55a82f84264970df9aa0aa85e88b694", "url": "https://github.com/ls1intum/Artemis/commit/b09ca4cec55a82f84264970df9aa0aa85e88b694", "message": "update screenshots", "committedDate": "2020-10-19T17:26:00Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "cd017ceeac5b88c3a3d1eb309daf658f961a4427", "url": "https://github.com/ls1intum/Artemis/commit/cd017ceeac5b88c3a3d1eb309daf658f961a4427", "message": "Merge branch 'chore/exam-mode-documentation' of github.com:ls1intum/Artemis into chore/exam-mode-documentation", "committedDate": "2020-10-19T17:30:42Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "73b649056e5593b0d91ac438333b9fbc1a4e931e", "url": "https://github.com/ls1intum/Artemis/commit/73b649056e5593b0d91ac438333b9fbc1a4e931e", "message": "add delete test run image", "committedDate": "2020-10-19T22:13:36Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "1ab1c4ee4f632b3242c0e23bd6d5d449988d95e6", "url": "https://github.com/ls1intum/Artemis/commit/1ab1c4ee4f632b3242c0e23bd6d5d449988d95e6", "message": "update the instructor documentation based on the feedback", "committedDate": "2020-10-19T22:40:11Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "3bbfe1da22a38cdc64551b8cd77f99033188939c", "url": "https://github.com/ls1intum/Artemis/commit/3bbfe1da22a38cdc64551b8cd77f99033188939c", "message": "Improve text and layout", "committedDate": "2020-10-19T23:10:12Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "70af458bae13f5f57ce3f449a79817563319255c", "url": "https://github.com/ls1intum/Artemis/commit/70af458bae13f5f57ce3f449a79817563319255c", "message": "Merge branch 'develop' into chore/exam-mode-documentation", "committedDate": "2020-10-19T23:13:13Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwNzE4NTU3NA==", "url": "https://github.com/ls1intum/Artemis/pull/2217#discussion_r507185574", "bodyText": "Spell Version Control and Continuous Integration out if you haven't defined the abbreviation before.", "author": "kloessst", "createdAt": "2020-10-18T16:49:53Z", "path": "docs/user/exams/instructors_guide.rst", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,192 @@\n+===================\n+Instructors\u2019 Guide\n+===================\n+\n+.. _timeline:\n+\n+Timeline of an Artemis Online Exam\n+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n+\n+    .. _exam_creation_and_configuration:\n+\n+- **Exam Creation and Configuration**\n+    During the exam creation and configuration, you can create your exam and configure it to fit your needs.

The results are then updated automatically. \n+\n+\n+Accessing the Exam Management Page\n+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n+- Log in to Artemis with your account credentials.\n+- Head to ``Course Management``.\n+- Click on ``Exams`` for your course. It will open the *Exam Management Screen*.\n+\n+    - Here you have access to all the exams of your course. All aspects of the exam are managed from the management screen. \n+\n+- You can create an exam by clicking on ``Create new Exam``. \n+\n+Create and Configure Exam\n+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n+- When you click on ``create an exam`` you are presented with the *Create Exam* view. Here you can set the basic information such as ``title``, ``examiner`` etc. The :ref:`timeline of the exam <timeline>` is defined by the dates: ``visible from``, ``start of working time``, ``end of working time``, ``release date of results``, ``begin of student review``, ``end of student review``. \n+- The first three dates are mandatory when you create an exam. The rest can be set when required. \n+- The ``grace period`` defines the amount of time the students have at their disposal to hand in their exam after the ``working time`` is over. This is set to 3 minutes by default. \n+- You can also define the ``number of exercises`` in the exam. You can leave this out initally, however it must be set before you can generate the student exams. For more information, see `Exercise Groups`_. \n+- If you activate ``randomize order of exercise groups``, the order of the exercises will be random for each student. \n+- Finally, you can fill out the ``exam start-`` and ``end texts``. These will be displayed during the :ref:`exam conduction <exam_conduction>` to the students, at the *Start-* and *End* page respectively.\n+\n+.. figure:: instructor/exam_configuration.png\n+   :alt: Create and Configure\n+   :align: center\n+\n+   Create and Configure the Exam\n+\n+Exercise Groups\n+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n+- Artemis exam mode allows you to define multiple exercise variants so that each student can receive a unique exam. This is done through the exercise groups. Exercise groups represent an individual exercise slot for each student exam. Within one exercise group you can define different exercises. \n+- Artemis selects one exercise per exercise group randomly to generate the individual student exams. \n+- You can distinguish between ``mandatory`` exercise groups and ``non-mandatory`` exercise groups. By default, every exercise group is mandatory. You can set the ``mandetory`` flag when you add a exercise group initially, or later by clicking ``edit`` on the exercise group.\n+\n+.. figure:: instructor/exercise_variants.png\n+   :alt: Exercise Groups with different Exercise Variants\n+   :align: center\n+\n+   Exercise Groups with different Exercise Variants\n+\n+Add Exercises\n+^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n+- Exercises are grouped by exercise groups. For every student exam, one exercise per exercise group will be chosen, see `Exercise Groups`_. \n+\n+     - **Hint:** If you want all student to have the same exam, define only one exercise per exercise group.\n+\n+- To add exercises navigate to the *Exercise Groups* of the exam. On the header of each exercise group you will find the available exercise types. You can choose between ``creating a new exercise`` or ``importing an existing one`` from your courses. \n+\n+    - **Hint:** For programming exercises you can check the option to ``allow manual assessment``. If you do not set this flag, your assessors will not be able to manually assess the student's submissions during the :ref:`assessment process <exam_assessment>`.\n+\n+- For exercise types ``text``, ``programming``, and ``modeling``, you can also define example submissions and example assessments to guide your assessor team.\n+\n+.. figure:: instructor/add_exercises.png\n+   :alt: Add different Exercises\n+   :align: center\n+\n+   Add different Exercises\n+\n+Registering Students\n+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n+- To register students to the exam, navigate from the exam management to the *Students* page.

The rest can be set when required. \n+- The ``grace period`` defines the amount of time the students have at their disposal to hand in their exam after the ``working time`` is over. This is set to 3 minutes by default. \n+- You can also define the ``number of exercises`` in the exam. You can leave this out initally, however it must be set before you can generate the :ref:`student exams <student_exams>`. For more information, see `1.3 Exercise Groups`_. \n+- Artemis will randomize the order of the exercises for each student if you you activate ``randomize order of exercise groups``.\n+- Finally, you can fill out the exam ``start text`` and ``end text``.

Artemis achieves this through exercise groups. Exercise groups represent an individual exercise slot for each :ref:`student exam <student_exams>`. Within one exercise group you can define different exercises. \n+- Artemis selects one exercise per exercise group randomly, to generate the individual :ref:`student exams <student_exams>`. \n+- You can distinguish between ``mandatory`` exercise groups and ``non-mandatory`` exercise groups. \n+- Artemis always includes ``mandatory`` exercise groups in the individual exam of a student. \n+- ``non-mandatory`` exercise groups can be left out, if there are more exercise groups than the ``number of exercises`` defined in the :ref:`exam configuration <exam_creation_and_configuration>`.\n+- By default, every exercise group is mandatory. You can set the ``mandetory`` flag when you add a exercise group initially, or later by clicking |edit| on the exercise group.", "originalCommit": "dcfe4576a90c2cdeff73be2913e7322763b9705a", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwODM4MTg5Mg==", "url": "https://github.com/ls1intum/Artemis/pull/2217#discussion_r508381892", "bodyText": "Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n            - At the end of the online exercise, you must be online within a given ``grace period`` and submit your exam, otherwise it will not be graded\n          \n          \n            \n            - At the end of the online exercise, you must be online within a given ``grace period`` and submit your exam, otherwise it will not be graded.", "author": "FuchsDominik", "createdAt": "2020-10-20T10:18:19Z", "path": "docs/user/exams/students_guide.rst", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,340 @@\n+===================\n+Students\u2019 Guide\n+===================\n+\n+General Information\n+-------------------\n+\n+Prerequisites\n+^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n+- **Stable internet connection**\n+\n+    **Recommendation:** Use a LAN connection if possible.\n+\n+- **Browser**\n+    \n+    **Recommendation:** Chromium (based), e.g. Google Chrome, newest version.\n+\n+- The following prerequisites are only required if your exam contains programming exercises: \n+\n+    - **Java IDE with JDK 15**\n+        \n+        **Recommendation:** Eclipse IDE 2020\u201109.\n+    \n+    - **Git Client**\n+        \n+        **Recommendation:** SourceTree\n+\n+\n+Offline Mode\n+^^^^^^^^^^^^\n+- The exam mode in Artemis tolerates issues with the Internet connection.\n+- In case you are not connected, you can continue working on text-, quiz- and modeling exercises, but you might get warnings that your solutions cannot be saved.\n+- If your Internet connection recovers, Artemis will save your solution.\n+- Artemis tries to save your solution every 30 seconds, when you navigate between exercises and when you click |save| or |save_continue|.\n+- Programming exercises have 2 modes.\n+\n+    1. **Online code editor:** can only be used when you are online. \n+\n+        .. note::\n+            You have to click on Submit!
