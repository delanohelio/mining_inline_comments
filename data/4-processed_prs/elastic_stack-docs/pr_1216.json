So one asciidoc file = one HTML file.\n2 - To control TOC nesting, we should explore using level offsets. I've done this in the ingest management docs with mixed success. (The strategy worked for +1 and +2 offsets, but broke for anything nested more deeply.) We should follow up with other teams to see if they've had more success, but I think it's the best way forward to make it easier to decouple TOC/navigation from heading levels.", "author": "dedemorton", "createdAt": "2020-06-27T02:16:14Z", "path": "docs/en/observability/observability-introduction.asciidoc", "diffHunk": "@@ -1,9 +1,36 @@\n [[observability-introduction]]\n [role=\"xpack\"]\n-\n-= Observability \n-++++\n-<titleabbrev>What is Elastic Observability?</titleabbrev>\n-++++\n+== What is Elastic Observability?
