I know it seems odd, but lots of users still search on \"ELK\" when they're first getting started. So here's the backstory:\nOriginally I used \"ELK tutorial\" in the opening paragraph of this topic because forum users kept searching on \"ELK tutorial\" and finding a topic on the Digital Ocean website that recommended old Beats settings. These settings were causing major problems. Adding \"ELK tutorial\" pushed us up quite a bit in the rankings.\nIt looks like @szabosteve removed \"tutorial\" from the topic, but that might be OK because the Digital Ocean tutorial isn't completely broken now.", "author": "dedemorton", "createdAt": "2020-05-21T22:22:13Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyODc2NDgyNA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyOTc1ODgxNA==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/pull/1099#discussion_r429758814", "bodyText": "@dedemorton\nYes, it was me back in the DEVO days. Our working group dealt with Getting started/Tutorial/Quickstart definitions and content. As part of that effort, we tried to streamline the wording of the respective pieces. Sometimes it was just to remove a word that defines the function of the piece, like here. I wasn't aware that time the reasoning behind calling it a tutorial or that you are the author of this piece, DeDe, that's why I didn't ask you about it.
