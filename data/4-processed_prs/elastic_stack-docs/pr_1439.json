Set it to `true`.\n+\n+* `include`: Set this to `definition` for the API to include the definition in \n+the response.\n+\n+* `decompress_definition`: It specifies in what format the included model \n+definition should be returned. Set it to `false` for getting a custom compressed \n+format. It is also valid to use the JSON format, but it is not optimal. As the \n+decompressed definition may be significantly larger, it is recommended to use \n+the compressed format.\n+   \n+The following call is an example to get the trained model definition.
