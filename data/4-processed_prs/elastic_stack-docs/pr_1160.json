The recommended way to assess this is to go straight to {es} data queries, or maybe just use {kib} Discover app. Look for any data in the index your {agent} is sending to (metrics-* for example) and see if the name.host of your host machine shows. If not, then perhaps the data is getting trapped / blocked in the network or isn't sent off of the {agent} host correctly in the first place due to some Firewall or security reason. While it should be redundant, it is all the same potentially helpful to install the stand-alone Metricbeat (see the Elastic docs for information) to see if that works to send data into ES, which would indicate a bug or problem in the {agent} side.\n+If {elastic-agent} is set up and running, but you don't see data in {kib}:\n \n-[float]\n-[[i-deleted-my-agent]]\n-== I deleted {agent} in the {fleet} {ingest-manager} app how can I get it back?\n \n-Its ok, we got your back!

For example:\n++\n+[source,console]\n+----\n+GET metrics-*/_search\n+----\n++\n+Or if you prefer, go to the **Discover** app.\n \n-To stop the {agent} and relating executables running on my hosts is as easy as stopping the {agent} process. If you installed it as a service on Windows you will need to manage that, as well. After that, if needed, on Windows you can use Task Manager and shut down {agent} which will kill it and the sub-processes it created ({beats}). On Linux / macOS you can kill the `elastic-agent` process running, look with a `ps | grep elastic-agent` call to get the id to kill.\n+.

For\n+more information, see\n+{metricbeat-ref}/metricbeat-getting-started.html[Get started with {metricbeat}].\n \n-If you installed {agent} on Windows as a service with powershell, the agent should still be running after a reboot of the host. On macOS and Linux you will need to start the agent again from the command line each time as noted in the prior Agent start up steps. Adding support to install as a service on all supported systems will be done in a future release. To achieve this in the meantime, you can add the start command to a user's start up profile.\n+If {metricbeat} is able to send data to {es}, there is possibly a bug or\n+problem with {agent}, and you should report it.\n \n [float]\n-[[what-is-the-endpoint-package]]\n-== The {ingest-manager} app shows an Integration called 'Endpoint', what is it?\n+[[i-deleted-my-agent]]\n+== How do I restore an {agent} that I deleted from {fleet}?\n \n-In 7.8, the Endpoint Integration is non-functional. It cannot be used yet. It exists as an artifact of the current feature development, please watch for announcements during coming release cycles. As a teaser, Endpoint is the integration that will allow the Elastic Security app to have a dedicated executable running like a beat to protect the host and allow responses to security concerns that are found. It will be managed by {agent} as other beats are.\n+It's ok, we've got your back! The data is still in {es}.

To do this you must modify both the {es} and {kib} configs as well as adhering to all 'security enabled' requirements, like modifying the default elastic user password, see below for details:\n+To stop {agent} and its related executables, stop the {agent} process.\n \n-For {es}, file `config/elasticsearch.yml` you must set these startup options:\n+On Windows, if you installed the agent as a service, stop the service.
