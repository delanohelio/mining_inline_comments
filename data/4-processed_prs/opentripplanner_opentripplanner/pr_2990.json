In a very large graph build for multiple Northeast US states, the time it took to download the elevation data and calculate all of the elevations took 5,509 seconds (roughly 1.5 hours).\n+\n+If you are using cloud computing for your OTP instances, it is recommended to create prebuilt images that contain the elevation data you need. This will save time because all of the data won't need to be downloaded.\n+\n+However, the bulk of the time will still spent calculating elevations for all of the street edges. Therefore, a further optimazation can be done to calculate and save the elevation data during a graph build and then save it for future use.\n+\n+In order to write out the precalculated elevation data, add this to your `build-config.json` file:\n+\n+```JSON\n+// build-config.json\n+{  \n+  \"writeCachedElevations\": true\n+}\n+```\n+\n+After building the graph, a file called `cached_elevations.obj` will be written to the cache directory. By default, this file is not written during graph builds. There is also a graph build parameter called `readCachedElevations` which is set to `true` by default.\n+\n+In graph builds, the elevation module will attempt to read the `cached_elevations.obj` file from the cache directory. The cache directory defaults to `/var/otp/cache`, but this can be overriden via the CLI argument `--cache <directory>`. For the same graph build for multiple Northeast US states, the time it took with using this predownloaded and precalculated data became 543.7 seconds (roughly 9 minutes).\n+\n+The cached data is a lookup table where the coordinate sequences of respective street edges are used as keys for calculated data. Therefore, it is expected that over time various edits to OpenStreetMap will cause this cached data to become stale and not include new OSM ways. Therefore, periodic update of this cached data is recommended.\n+", "originalCommit": "c564b0ad2df98f2bb7bc49288973967578a8f697", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5ODg2ODAyMA==", "url": "https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/pull/2990#discussion_r398868020", "bodyText": "I don't understand what you mean by accessed flag.

The reasoning behind not immediately creating a coverage instance is that it can cause a lot of blocking in the beginning when the ForkJoinPool begins. When using the cached elevations, it is highly likely that most edges will already have a value present in the cache and therefore not even need a coverage instance. By lazy-creating the coverage instances other threads can continue to process edges that are available in the cache that don't need a coverage instance, otherwise, a lot of threads will be waiting for each other at the start until a coverage instance has been calculated for each thread.\nRegarding the thread-safe assignment, I don't fully understand how it would not be thread-safe to assign the value in this way since the field would only be accessed by the thread doing the assignment and not by anything else.
