However, the https://github.com/wildfly-security/wildfly-openssl-natives[WildFly OpenSSL Natives project]\n+contains modules that can be used to build WildFly OpenSSL native libraries for other platforms as well. The steps needed to build and make\n+use of a WildFly OpenSSL native library for a different platform than the ones provided by default will be described below.\n+\n+=== Building the Native Library\n+\n+Make sure you have cloned the https://github.com/wildfly-security/wildfly-openssl-natives[WildFly OpenSSL Natives] project\n+locally. We'll use `$WILDFLY_OPENSSL_NATIVES` to denote the path to this project. Next, `cd` to the module that you want\n+to build. In this example, we'll use the `linux-i386` module but similar steps can be used to build and make use of another\n+module instead.\n+\n+[source,shell]\n+----\n+cd $WILDFLY_OPENSSL_NATIVES/linux-i386\n+mvn clean install\n+----\n+\n+Notice that this now results in a `wildfly-openssl-linux-i386-VERSION.jar` in the `$WILDFLY_OPENSSL_NATIVES/linux-i386/target` directory.\n+We'll make use of this in the next step.\n+\n+=== Adding a New Module to WildFly\n+\n+First, add a new module that contains the WildFly OpenSSL Java artifact:", "originalCommit": "d8b8e7bf5bb5fddf5fa361f5c8ae4dbd2e8b264b", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxMTAzODU3OQ==", "url": "https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly/pull/13667#discussion_r511038579", "bodyText": "Good point, I've updated this section to mention that.
