Publishing is a very important operation, and if the user does not specify which variant they are trying to publish, then it's wrong and dangerous to think we can correctly guess what they want.

There is a Design pattern \"\" Null Object Pattern \"\" which provides more information on this.\nif I were to do the same, I would typically prefer to return an empty collection  or String rather than null as it means my client code is cleaner.\nRegarding my second query tagging  @xdavidson   to provide some more inputs.", "author": "rednitish", "createdAt": "2020-08-26T14:55:01Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ3NzE1MzM0MA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ3NzQyNTMxOQ==", "url": "https://github.com/redhataccess/pantheon/pull/383#discussion_r477425319", "bodyText": "Thanks for clarifying, Nitish.\nI think I understand what you're describing, but I have two thoughts.\n1st and more relevant: the code is not any different and/or cleaner if we replace a null check with an empty string check. It is practically identical.\n2nd and less relevant, but still related: saying that something is a \"good design pattern\" or \"bad design pattern\" generally may be true, but that doesn't mean it's the right or wrong tool for the job in any specific circumstance. I would agree that if we were in some hypothetical example where we were building a collection, then returning an empty collection would be more appropriate than returning null, and the pattern you refer to might apply nicely to that. However, the situation we have here is different. We are asking for input that the user supplied, and the value of null has the special meaning of \"the user did not supply anything\" which would be distinct from \"the user supplied a value of nothing.\"\nUltimately, this is splitting hairs. Avoiding the use of null does not gain us anything tangible here, so I'm not in favor of making that code change.", "author": "benradey", "createdAt": "2020-08-26T16:19:00Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ3NzE1MzM0MA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ3ODE3NDU1NQ==", "url": "https://github.com/redhataccess/pantheon/pull/383#discussion_r478174555", "bodyText": "Thanks Ben & Thanks again for putting forward your thoughts, But i still strongly disagree with point 1 you mentioned.\nand yes, we opt for different design patterns according to our requirement, and I can see a lot of points where we should include them.
