However, the only supported way to get documents into an \"official Pantheon repository\" is to do a git sync via the Pantheon UI. Users would be specifically prevented from a command line invocation as described here.\nHaving said that, in the future, we'll be supporting user sandboxes that the users can use as a skunkworks area for whatever they like (previewing in-progress docs with CP chroming, sharing those links internally, verifying cross-repo includes when we have them, etc). Docs in a sandbox will not be publishable so we're less strict about how they get there, and therefore CLI upload will be an option for that. However, sandboxes don't exist today, and when they do, we'll likely require an additional 'pantheon push' parameter or another pantheon2.yml entry.\nFor now, I would recommend keeping the section that involves setting up the yaml, and breaking out the CLI portion into a separate doc to be saved for later when we do have sandbox functionality implemented.", "author": "benradey", "createdAt": "2020-06-11T17:14:22Z", "path": "pantheon-bundle/src/main/resources/SLING-INF/content/docs/modules/proc_command-line-interface.adoc", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,52 @@\n+[id=\"command-line-interface_{context}\"]\n+\n+= Using the Command Line Interface\n+\n+Some operations available in the Pantheon user interface can also be performed using commands in the command line interface.\n+\n+.Using the `Pantheon uploader` via the command line\n+\n+.
