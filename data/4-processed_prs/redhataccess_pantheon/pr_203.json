For MS2, we only support getting docs into the system through git. The CLI also currently works for that, but that is unsupported and that functionality will be disabled at some point.\nLong term, we will introduce sandboxes, which are transient workspaces that house documents that cannot be published, and the method to populate those will primarily be the CLI tool, among other possible methods.
