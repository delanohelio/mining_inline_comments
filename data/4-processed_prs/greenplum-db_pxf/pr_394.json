This lack of\ncommunication that an IOException has occurred is causing problems with\nsubsequent requests. Re-throwing the exception allows Spring MVC to\ncatch it and mark the connection as broken so it stops writing.\n\nThe short version of what happens is:\n- client drops connection async thread is writing to\n- Tomcat cleans this up\n- Request/Response/Processor gets put back in pool\n- New connections come in\n- Processor above gets allocated to one of them\n- Original async thread tries writing again, fails and puts the processor into an error state\n- Tomcat tries to process the new connection\n- Processor is in an error state so the connection is closed before the request is even read\n\nCo-authored-by: Mark Thomas <thomasma@vmware.com>\nCo-authored-by: Francisco Guerrero <aguerrero@pivotal.io>", "committedDate": "2020-06-23T20:41:23Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0NTExOTc5MQ==", "url": "https://github.com/greenplum-db/pxf/pull/394#discussion_r445119791", "bodyText": "I don't know if we even should log this as error, since this is not really an error condition when GPDB routinely does this. maybe use WARN ?", "author": "denalex", "createdAt": "2020-06-24T19:24:56Z", "path": "server/pxf-service/src/main/java/org/greenplum/pxf/service/rest/BridgeResponse.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -73,17 +73,24 @@ private Void writeToInternal(OutputStream out) throws IOException {\n                 ++recordCount;\n             }\n             LOG.debug(\"Finished streaming fragment {} of resource {}, {} records.\", fragment, dataDir, recordCount);\n-        } catch (ClientAbortException e) {\n-            // Occurs whenever client (GPDB) decides to end the connection\n-            if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {\n-                // Stacktrace in debug\n-                LOG.debug(\"Remote connection closed by GPDB\", e);\n+        } catch (Exception e) {\n+            IOException ioe;\n+            if (e instanceof ClientAbortException) {\n+                // Occurs whenever client (GPDB) decides to end the connection\n+                if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {\n+                    // Stacktrace in debug\n+                    LOG.debug(\"Remote connection closed by GPDB\", e);\n+                } else {\n+                    LOG.error(\"Remote connection closed by GPDB (Enable debug for stacktrace)\");", "originalCommit": "9f29fea0939f93011c18f38f02ebdaa842551f6c", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0NTEyNjA1Nw==", "url": "https://github.com/greenplum-db/pxf/pull/394#discussion_r445126057", "bodyText": "true, it should be a warn", "author": "frankgh", "createdAt": "2020-06-24T19:37:19Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0NTExOTc5MQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0NTEyMzA0OQ==", "url": "https://github.com/greenplum-db/pxf/pull/394#discussion_r445123049", "bodyText": "I kinda like the previous logic better, where we handle ClientAbortException only and the common block of wrapping any exception as IOException, unless it is already an IOException.", "author": "denalex", "createdAt": "2020-06-24T19:31:20Z", "path": "server/pxf-service/src/main/java/org/greenplum/pxf/service/rest/BridgeResponse.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -73,17 +73,24 @@ private Void writeToInternal(OutputStream out) throws IOException {\n                 ++recordCount;\n             }\n             LOG.debug(\"Finished streaming fragment {} of resource {}, {} records.\", fragment, dataDir, recordCount);\n-        } catch (ClientAbortException e) {\n-            // Occurs whenever client (GPDB) decides to end the connection\n-            if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {\n-                // Stacktrace in debug\n-                LOG.debug(\"Remote connection closed by GPDB\", e);\n+        } catch (Exception e) {\n+            IOException ioe;\n+            if (e instanceof ClientAbortException) {\n+                // Occurs whenever client (GPDB) decides to end the connection\n+                if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {\n+                    // Stacktrace in debug\n+                    LOG.debug(\"Remote connection closed by GPDB\", e);\n+                } else {\n+                    LOG.error(\"Remote connection closed by GPDB (Enable debug for stacktrace)\");\n+                }\n+                ioe = (ClientAbortException) e;\n+            } else if (e instanceof IOException) {\n+                ioe = (IOException) e;\n             } else {\n-                LOG.error(\"Remote connection closed by GPDB (Enable debug for stacktrace)\");\n+                ioe = new IOException(e.getMessage(), e);\n             }\n-            throw e;\n-        } catch (Exception e) {\n-            throw e instanceof IOException ?
