The out-of-the-box experience for PXF with\nJDBC is not great because an error is encountered during writes for\nexample when we have a large amount of data. The same is true for reads\nthat transfer large amounts of data.\n\nThis error is encountered on segment hosts that have more than 5\nsegments per host. A typical use case for PXF is residing on a host with\n8 segments per hosts. This issue will surface right away on those\nsegment hosts. In some cases users have 12 segments per host. Increasing\nthe maximumPoolSize to 15 seems like a new sensible default that will\nallow the out-of-the-box experience be smoother for PXF.", "committedDate": "2020-10-14T21:42:47Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwNTg5NTY4MQ==", "url": "https://github.com/greenplum-db/pxf/pull/461#discussion_r505895681", "bodyText": "this will not take effect on pre-existing RPM installations after upgrade. we should release doc this, @lisakowen fyi", "author": "denalex", "createdAt": "2020-10-15T22:17:30Z", "path": "server/pxf-service/src/templates/user/templates/jdbc-site.xml", "diffHunk": "@@ -34,7 +34,7 @@\n \n     <property>\n         <name>jdbc.pool.property.maximumPoolSize</name>\n-        <value>5</value>\n+        <value>15</value>", "originalCommit": "ac22c3cadb17411fbe47962025c57e902dfdb61b", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwNTg5Nzk1Nw==", "url": "https://github.com/greenplum-db/pxf/pull/461#discussion_r505897957", "bodyText": "yes, anyone that has already configured the JDBC connector using the jdbc-site.xml will either manually have to modify their jdbc.pool.property.maximumPoolSize value to 15 in case they want to have the defaults that PXF provides", "author": "frankgh", "createdAt": "2020-10-15T22:23:35Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwNTg5NTY4MQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwNTkwMDc1OQ==", "url": "https://github.com/greenplum-db/pxf/pull/461#discussion_r505900759", "bodyText": "thanks for calling this out.  i was going to ask about upgrade implication for all of the *-xite.xml changes in 5.16:  the commenting out of pxf.service.user.name in pxf-site.xml, the new pxf.fs.basepath property in pxf-site.xml, and this.\nyes, we will release note each of these changes.  and upgrade should probably identify each and provide info to the user as to if/when they might want to change their current server definitions.", "author": "lisakowen", "createdAt": "2020-10-15T22:31:08Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwNTg5NTY4MQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwNTk0OTcwMQ==", "url": "https://github.com/greenplum-db/pxf/pull/461#discussion_r505949701", "bodyText": "this will NOT impact not only anyone that has already configured the JDBC connector, but everyone who already had a previous version installed (already ran pxf init, as we copy the templates to PXF_CONF/templates).", "author": "denalex", "createdAt": "2020-10-16T00:59:56Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwNTg5NTY4MQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwNjQ2NjIxMw==", "url": "https://github.com/greenplum-db/pxf/pull/461#discussion_r506466213", "bodyText": "Actually, we overwrite templates during init inside $PXF_CONF/templates, and you are required to re-init anyway.
