The performance degradation occurs at\norg.greenplum.pxf.api.io.Text#setCapacity. Once the original buffer size\nwas exceeded, the setCapacity call would increase the buffer size by 1\nand perform a copy of bytes. This became extremely slow when writing\nwide rows because org.greenplum.pxf.api.io.Text would consume from the\nbuffer until it encountered a line break delimiter (\\n). In this commit,\nwe delay consuming from the InputStream until the writing to HCFS\noccurs, we consume the InputStream during write. The downside of this\napproach is that we don't report the number of tuples written to the\nexternal system correctly anymore, as we will always report a single\ntuple written.", "committedDate": "2020-08-05T10:13:11Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2NjEwNDEwOQ==", "url": "https://github.com/greenplum-db/pxf/pull/416#discussion_r466104109", "bodyText": "being inside this if means external table was defined with FORMAT \"TEXT\" or \"CSV\", not that the actual profile will be:text, right ?
