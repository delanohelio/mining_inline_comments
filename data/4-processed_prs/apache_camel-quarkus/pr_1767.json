While native mode is clearly superior when it\n+comes to application start time, memory consumption and size on disk, the JVM mode may still be a valid option. Here is\n+why:\n+\n+First, Quarkus works really well on stock JVMs, such as OpenJDK. While the memory consumption and start times are not\n+as good as in native mode, they are still very good when\n+https://quarkus.io/blog/runtime-performance/#application-start-time[compared] to traditional JVM stacks.\n+\n+Second, JVM mode beats native mode in https://quarkus.io/blog/runtime-performance/#throughput-reqsec[peak throughput]\n+and https://quarkus.io/blog/runtime-performance/#response-times-ms[response latency]. You should prefer JVM mode if\n+these metrics matter to you.\n+\n+And third, creating a Quarkus extension that works well both in JVM and native mode requires some time and\n+xref:contributor-guide/create-new-extension.adoc[expertise]. In case some extension is needed quickly and the native\n+support is dispensable, relying on JVM-only extensions may make a lot of sense.\n+\n+== How to create a JVM-only extension\n+\n+The steps are the same as when xref:contributor-guide/create-new-extension.adoc[creating a native extension], except\n+for the following:\n+\n+* Add `-Dcq.nativeSupported=false` to `cq:create` mojo invocation:", "originalCommit": "04770c8c34cd62aaf8a9888b2b01310e49c85c48", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4NTYyMjYzNQ==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/pull/1767#discussion_r485622635", "bodyText": "Oh geez, have forgotten to paste it there?!?!
