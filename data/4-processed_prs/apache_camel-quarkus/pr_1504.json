Grok default patterns includes things like mac, ip, number and so on.\nThat said, patterns/patterns may be a bit vague but is not under our control. The test coverage must be correct as we are using mac, ip and so on in itests. Concerning the doc, I would let it in camel, maybe just clarify the predefined patterns section.\nWDYT ?", "author": "aldettinger", "createdAt": "2020-07-29T13:05:26Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2MjIyNzc5NA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2MjI5ODUyNw==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/pull/1504#discussion_r462298527", "bodyText": "Oh, I see, so, patterns/patterns is not intended to be used by end users, right?
