E.g. komoot returns a custom format probably unsimplified resulting in ~5MB (just picked a 200km route) where our route returns quickly and only needs <100KB :) (but probably this is more due to our compact path details representation and not so much due to the simplification. maybe interesting improvement @jtheuer ;) )", "author": "karussell", "createdAt": "2020-07-13T14:52:05Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ1MzM0Mjc4MQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}]}
