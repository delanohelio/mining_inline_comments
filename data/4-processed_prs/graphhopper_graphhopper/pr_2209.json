For example, here the speed factor of \n-a road segment that has `road_class=motorway` will be `0.5`, the speed factor of a road segment that additionally has \n-`road_environment=tunnel` will be `0.4` and the speed factor of a road segment that has `road_class=secondary` and \n-`road_environment=tunnel` will be `0.8`.\n+Here also quotes around every expression and a comma is used to write one statement per YAML line. \n+Which looks more like JSON which is also possible for server-side profiles and the only way to write custom models at \n+query time:\n \n-Instead of setting the speed factors for certain values you can instead set the speed factors for all *other* values using\n-as special key (`\"*\"`), like this:\n-```yaml\n-speed_factor: \n-  road_class: {\"*\": 0.5}\n-  road_environment: {tunnel: 0.8, \"*\": 0.6}\n+```json\n+{ \"speed\": [\n+    { \"if\": \"road_class == MOTORWAY\", \"multiply by\": 0.5 },\n+    { \"if\": \"road_environment == TUNNEL\", \"multiply by\": 0.8 }\n+  ]\n+}\n ```\n \n-So in this example we set a speed factor of `0.5` regardless of the `road_class` and all `road_environment` values yield\n-a speed factor of `0.6` *except* `tunnel` which gets a speed factor of `0.8`.

For example this is how you\n-can reduce the the speed of every edge that has the value 'motorway' for the category 'road_class' to fifty percent of \n+For every road segment a default speed is inherited from the base vehicle and you have multiple options to adjust it.\n+The first thing you can do is rescaling the default speeds using `multiply by`. For example this is how you\n+can reduce the speed of every road segment that has the value `MOTORWAY` for the category 'road_class' to fifty percent of \n the default speed that is normally used by the base vehicle for this road class:\n ```yaml\n-speed_factor:\n-  road_class: {motorway: 0.5}\n-```  \n-Note that `road_class: {motorway: 0.5}` is an alternative YAML notation that is equivalent to:\n-```yaml\n-speed_factor:\n-  road_class:\n-    motorway: 0.5\n+speed:\n+  - if: road_class == MOTORWAY\n+    multiply by: 0.5\n ```\n \n-You can also setup speed factors for multiple road classes like this\n+You can also change the speed in case of different road classes like this\n ```yaml\n-speed_factor:\n-  road_class: {motorway: 0.5, primary: 0.7, tertiary: 0.9}\n+speed:\n+  - if: road_class == MOTORWAY\n+    multiply by: 0.5\n+  - if: road_class == PRIMARY || road_class == TERTIARY\n+    multiply by: 0.7\n ```\n \n-and use multiple categories to influence the speed factor\n+The OR-operator `||` means if the left **or** right expressions is true then the value `0.7` is used.\n+You can also use multiple categories in the expressions:\n+\n ```yaml\n-speed_factor:\n-  road_class: {motorway: 0.5}\n-  road_environment: {tunnel: 0.8}\n+speed:\n+  - if: \"road_class == MOTORWAY\",     multiply by: 0.5\n+  - if: \"road_environment == TUNNEL\", multiply by: 0.8\n ```\n \n-If an edge matches multiple rules the speed factor values will be multiplied. For example, here the speed factor of \n-a road segment that has `road_class=motorway` will be `0.5`, the speed factor of a road segment that additionally has \n-`road_environment=tunnel` will be `0.4` and the speed factor of a road segment that has `road_class=secondary` and \n-`road_environment=tunnel` will be `0.8`.\n+Here also quotes around every expression and a comma is used to write one statement per YAML line. \n+Which looks more like JSON which is also possible for server-side profiles and the only way to write custom models at \n+query time:\n \n-Instead of setting the speed factors for certain values you can instead set the speed factors for all *other* values using\n-as special key (`\"*\"`), like this:\n-```yaml\n-speed_factor: \n-  road_class: {\"*\": 0.5}\n-  road_environment: {tunnel: 0.8, \"*\": 0.6}\n+```json\n+{ \"speed\": [\n+    { \"if\": \"road_class == MOTORWAY\", \"multiply by\": 0.5 },\n+    { \"if\": \"road_environment == TUNNEL\", \"multiply by\": 0.8 }\n+  ]\n+}\n ```\n \n-So in this example we set a speed factor of `0.5` regardless of the `road_class` and all `road_environment` values yield\n-a speed factor of `0.6` *except* `tunnel` which gets a speed factor of `0.8`. And as mentioned above for edges that match\n-multiple of these rules the different factors get multiplied.\n+There are other categories like `get_off_bike` that are of `boolean` type. You use them via:\n \n-For encoded values with boolean values, like `get_off_bike` you set the speed factor like this:\n ```yaml\n-speed_factor:\n-  get_off_bike: {true: 0.6, false: 1.0}\n+speed:\n+  - if: get_off_bike\n+    multiply by: 0.6\n ```\n-which means that for edges with `get_off_bike=true` the speed factor will be `0.6` and otherwise it will be `1.0`.\n-You can skip any of these values to retain the default.\n \n-For encoded values with numeric values, like `max_width` you use the `<` and `>` operators, like this:\n+which means that for edges with `get_off_bike==true` the speed factor will be `0.6`.\n+\n+For encoded values with numeric values, like `max_width` you should not use \"equality\" or \"inequality\" but the\n+comparison operators \"bigger\" `>`, \"bigger or equals\" `>=`, \"smaller\" `<` or \"smaller or equals\" `<=`, e.g.:\n ```yaml\n-speed_factor:\n-  max_width: {\"<2.5\": 0.8}\n+speed:\n+  - if: \"max_width < 2.5\", multiply by: 0.8\n ``` \n-which means that for all edges with `max_width` smaller than `2.5m` the speed factor is `0.8`.\n+which means that for all edges with `max_width` smaller than `2.5m` the speed is multiplied by `0.8`.\n \n-In any case values of `speed_factor` have to be in the range `[0,1]` and it is not possible to *increase* the speed for\n-edges of certain types. \n+Then there are categories of `string` type. You use them via:\n \n-Another way to change the speed is using the `max_speed` section, for example:\n ```yaml\n-max_speed:\n-  surface: {gravel: 60}\n+speed:\n+- if: country == \"DEU\"\n+  multiply by: 0\n ```\n \n-implies that on all road segments with `surface=gravel` the speed will be at most `60km/h`, regardless of the default \n-speed of this edge or the adjustments made by the `speed_factor` section. Just like with `speed_factor` you can setup\n-`max_speed` values for multiple category values and different categories. If multiple rules match for a given edge the\n-most restrictive rule will determine the speed (the minimum `max_speed` will be applied). \n-Values for `max_speed` must be in the range `[0,max_vehicle_speed]` where `max_vehicle_speed` is the maximum speed that\n-is set for the base vehicle (which you cannot change).\n+Another way to change the speed is using `limit to`:\n+```yaml\n+speed:\n+  - if: \"surface != GRAVEL\", limit to: 60\n+```\n+\n+This implies that on all road segments with no `GRAVEL` value for `surface` the speed will be at most `60km/h`,\n+regardless of the default speed of this road segment or the previous `multiply by` statements. Just like\n+with `multiply by` you can use multiple category values and different categories in the expressions for `limit to`. \n+If multiple statements match for a given edge the most restrictive statement will determine the speed.\n+\n+Values for `limit to` must be in the range `[0, max_vehicle_speed]` where `max_vehicle_speed` is the maximum speed that\n+is set for the base vehicle, and you cannot change it.\n+\n+An unconditional statement can be used as the last statement to limit the speed to a certain value under all conditions:\n+```yaml\n+speed:\n+  - if: \"true\", limit to: 90\n+```\n+\n+This means that the speed is at most `90km/h` for any road segments regardless of its properties.\n+\n+#### `else`\n+\n+Every `if` statement can have an `else` statement which is evaluated only when the `if`-condition is `false`.\n+\n+#### `else if`\n \n-You can also modify the speed for all edges in a certain area. To do this first add some areas to the `areas` section\n-of the custom model and then use this name to set a `speed_factor` or `max_speed` for this area. In the following\n-example we set the `speed_factor` of an area called `my_area` to `0.7`. For `max_speed` it works the same way. All area\n-names need to be prefixed with `area_`.  \n+If a road segment matches multiple expressions the speed will be multiplied.

What purpose would this have?\n\nTo me there just seem to be two 'stories' here and it makes the code easier to understand, test and change when we keep them separated. One story is about interpreting our custom model language and extracting a mapping between edges and speeds/priorities. This is already quite a complex task which involves janino and giving a meaning to the keys and values we define in the custom model. The other story is about taking the edge->speed/priority mapping and calculating edge weights from this (applying the formula we use in CustomWeighting). To me this seems to be independent from creating this mapping and for example we should be able to use CustomWeighting with some mapping that does not use yaml, janino and our custom model language at all. This also becomes clear when we think about testing : Right now its hard to test the first story in isolation (and I guess this is why we do not have such tests yet). We cannot really test the custom model language, janino and all this without creating a CustomWeighting. We also cannot create a CustomWeighting without using ExpressionBuilder or CustomWeightingHelper which are both related to janino. At the same time this coupling seems easily avoidable, because the edge->speed/priority mapping provides a very small boundary between the CustomWeighting and the custom model language interpreting code.\nHave a look at this test in CustomWeightingTest:\n       EdgeIteratorState primary = graph.edge(0, 1).setDistance(10).\n                set(roadClassEnc, PRIMARY).set(avSpeedEnc, 80).set(accessEnc, true, true);\n        EdgeIteratorState secondary = graph.edge(1, 2).setDistance(10).\n                set(roadClassEnc, SECONDARY).set(avSpeedEnc, 70).set(accessEnc, true, true);\n\n        CustomModel vehicleModel = new CustomModel();\n        vehicleModel.getPriority().put(\"road_class != PRIMARY\", 0.5);\n\n        assertEquals(1.15, createWeighting(vehicleModel).calcEdgeWeight(primary, false), 0.01);\n        assertEquals(1.73, createWeighting(vehicleModel).calcEdgeWeight(secondary, false), 0.01);\nHere we create some edges and a custom model and what we really want to do is testing if our custom model rules yield the right speed/priority. But we cannot test this directly so we create a CustomWeighting and have to check the outcome of our custom model indirectly (we have to know the formula in CustomWeighting). So we need to compare the weight we get to some magic numbers like 1.15 and 1.73.\nI will try to refactor this a bit so you can see what I mean exactly.", "author": "easbar", "createdAt": "2020-12-13T10:54:27Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0MTE0NDUzMA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0MTkxNzQ1Mw==", "url": "https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/pull/2209#discussion_r541917453", "bodyText": "See this draft: #2211", "author": "easbar", "createdAt": "2020-12-13T12:39:51Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0MTE0NDUzMA=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0MTE0NTM3Mg==", "url": "https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/pull/2209#discussion_r541145372", "bodyText": "Why 'maximum' distance_influence?

In your example the value 80 will still be picked in case of road_class==MOTORWAY.\nSo if we scan for if: true this should work?

This is more about how we can share code/yaml between custom models for example when we have a complex configuration and need multiple similar variations of it.
