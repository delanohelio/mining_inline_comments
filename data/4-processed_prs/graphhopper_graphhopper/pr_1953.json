These two usages are different in that the first only can have an effect during import (after the first import it becomes meaningless unless we rebuild the graph) while the other could (at least in theory) be changed for every single request. Is that correct? For this reason I think it would be cleaner to use two parameters, e.g. one would go into the (not yet existing) ImporterConfig and the other would go to RouterConfig and the latter could also be changed via the routing hints in Router#createPathMerger. I just wonder if this is overkill and I do not think its urgent to separate this into two parameters already. In any case the parameter used for the import is a good default value for the one used during routing?\n\nShould we still keep the two variables?\n\nWhich two variables do you mean?
