Seems unusually long. I'll answer with informations that may hopefully answer.\nYou may note that this method is static and takes a simple string, the question template. It does not consider whether something is really a field or note. If the template contains {{cloze:foobar}}, then it adds foobar to the list, whether or not foobar is actually a field. The caller will process the list and figure out what is and what is not a field. That's not a problem, because what takes a lot of time is regexp, matching pattern.

If I understand that correctly then this could work.\nMy only fear now then is that question templates can get quite large, keeping a static cache of them could result in a great deal of memory use. If you only need the original question template string to do the regex the first time, and then after that you are just using it as a key, perhaps you could make the key the hashCode of the string itself, and check based on it directly?

Question template can be large, indeed. However, the string saved in the cache are in a card type in a note type in the model manager. That means that saving the string does not actually takes more space.\nOf course, if a string no longer exists (e.g. it is changed, card type removed, etc...) then this keep the string in memory, so I should actually use a WeakHashMap\nUsing the hash value as entry is theoretically a bad idea; it would only work if we assume that no two strings ever get the same hash value... which is clearly realistic.
