He is entirely right. I thought I checkde for all counts, and that it was\nalways called:\n* in getCard, so that it is really reset.\n* in order to increment/decrement it; in which case we would increment/decrement a wrong number, which is not actually a\n  problem since reset will take this change into account\n\nHowever, in answer Card, we actually need the number of cards to know whether we should put the new card in second\nposition instead of first one.\n\nThis probably is not related to any current problem however, because the only difference is whether the card is moved\nfrom first to second position. The problem we have is inverse, that a card is moved to first or last position.\n\nIn my opinion, a better solution if we have no counts would be to check whether new/rev queue is not empty. It's always\nnice to fill it. But that would change the code to much for a really small improvement", "committedDate": "2020-08-21T08:44:52Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ3NDY1NTM0OA==", "url": "https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/pull/6938#discussion_r474655348", "bodyText": "Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n                            if (getCol().getSched().count()>0 && mStudyOptionsView != null) {\n          \n          \n            \n                            if (getCol().getSched().count() > 0 && mStudyOptionsView != null) {", "author": "david-allison-1", "createdAt": "2020-08-21T12:07:05Z", "path": "AnkiDroid/src/main/java/com/ichi2/anki/StudyOptionsFragment.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -456,8 +456,7 @@ public void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent intent) {\n         } else if (requestCode == AnkiActivity.REQUEST_REVIEW) {\n             if (resultCode == Reviewer.RESULT_NO_MORE_CARDS) {\n                 // If no more cards getting returned while counts > 0 (due to learn ahead limit) then show a snackbar\n-                int[] counts = getCol().getSched().counts();\n-                if ((counts[0]+counts[1]+counts[2])>0 && mStudyOptionsView != null) {\n+                if (getCol().getSched().count()>0 && mStudyOptionsView != null) {", "originalCommit": "71803ebae2a52a93f3886e4c0e59167f4b222be7", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ3NDcxMzYxNw==", "url": "https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/pull/6938#discussion_r474713617", "bodyText": "Done", "author": "Arthur-Milchior", "createdAt": "2020-08-21T13:55:34Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ3NDY1NTM0OA=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "70dfd427dfcfaa0732cccae7ded781f6b5e31fe7", "url": "https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/commit/70dfd427dfcfaa0732cccae7ded781f6b5e31fe7", "message": "NF: count\n\nI believe that `count` is easier to read than getting an array and adding the three first elements", "committedDate": "2020-08-21T13:54:13Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "70dfd427dfcfaa0732cccae7ded781f6b5e31fe7", "url": "https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/commit/70dfd427dfcfaa0732cccae7ded781f6b5e31fe7", "message": "NF: count\n\nI believe that `count` is easier to read than getting an array and adding the three first elements", "committedDate": "2020-08-21T13:54:13Z", "type": "forcePushed"}]}
