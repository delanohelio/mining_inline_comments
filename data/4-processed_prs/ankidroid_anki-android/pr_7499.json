It seems we are going to use screenshot and not explanations, which is not a bad idea at all. If we don't have explanation for current strings, it's strange to ask for future strings.\nMy point is only that I want to avoid duplicate strings. Sometime duplicate strings are necessary because two translations can be possible. In this case, and in this case only, I really want a comment to explain what is going on. That's going to be useful for translators of course, but also for futur dev.\u00a0Indeed, if a dev' want to reuse the string at some point in time, they'll need to know what ressource to use. Currently, it's not easy to make a choice between different ressources with the same English string", "author": "Arthur-Milchior", "createdAt": "2020-10-25T00:36:13Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxMTUyNjM5Ng=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxMjA0OTk3NA==", "url": "https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/pull/7499#discussion_r512049974", "bodyText": "@Arthur-Milchior glad I asked, I did not understand your intent.
