I understand this requires a lot of work, but I'm not really looking forward doing a perfect class since I expect it to be thrown away.\nRegardless: I'm not sure what you mean by \"mutable class\". Do you mean that you fill bad that they are setters ? Before my sequence of PR, they were only public members, so I fell like there is already a progress as far as object oriented code goes.\nI do not see the point of factory method here; maybe because I did far more functional programming that object oriented programming. If it may help the answer, my goal is still to create multiple classes, one with numbers, one without numbers.\u00a0You can see it in the big PR.

This makes far more sens according to me, would not be hard to port to java; would be extremely more efficient (because it allows to use a single query to the database instead of doing three query by deck), but pointless if we eventually uses rust directly.\nThe only trouble I'd have porting it to java is that current code upstream removed the method DeckDueList, and we use this method a lot in tests and in the remainder.
