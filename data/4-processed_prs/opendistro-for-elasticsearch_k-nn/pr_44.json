If it is disabled, a user will not be able to index knn_vector fields nor run KNN queries. The default value is *true.*\n+\n+##### knn.algo_param.index_thread_qty\n+This setting specifies how many threads the NMS library should use to create the graph in memory. By default, the NMS library sets this value to the number of cores the machine has. However, because ES can spawn the same number of threads for searching, this could lead to (number of cores)^2 threads running and lead to 100% CPU utilization. The default value is *1.*\n+\n+#### Cache\n+The KNN Plugin uses a Guava cache to keep track of the graphs currently loaded into native memory. When a query is run against a graph for the first time, the graph is loaded into native memory (outside the Java heap). Because Elasticsearch runs inside of the JVM, it cannot manage native memory directly. So, it keeps track of native memory by adding an entry into a Guava cache that contains the pointer to the graph in native memory and how much memory it uses.  The cache\u2019s weight just means how much native memory all of the elements in the cache are taking up. If the maximum weight (this value is set by *knn.memory.circuit_breaker.limit*) of the cache is exceeded when it tries to load a graph into memory, the cache evicts an entry to make room for the new entry. Additionally, the cache can evict entries based on how long it has been since they were last accessed. \n+\n+##### knn.cache.item.expiry.enabled\n+This setting indicates that the cache should evict entries that have expired (not been accessed for *knn.cache.item.expiry.minutes*). The default value is *false.*\n+\n+##### knn.cache.item.expiry.minutes\n+This setting indicates how long an item can be in the cache without being accessed before it expires. When an entry expires, it gets evicted from the cache. The default value is *180 minutes.*\n+\n+#### Circuit Breaker\n+For KNN, the circuit breaker is used to indicate when performance may degrade because the graphs loaded into native memory are reaching the cluster\u2019s total limits. Currently, the system does not perform any action once this limit is reached.\n+\n+##### knn.memory.circuit_breaker.enabled\n+This setting enables or disables the circuit breaker feature.  Disabling this setting will keep you at risk of Out of memory as we do not have control on the memory usage for the graphs. The default value is *true*. \n+\n+##### knn.memory.circuit_breaker.limit\n+This setting indicates the maximum capacity of the cache. When the cache attempts to load in a graph that exceeds this limit, it is forced to evict an entry and *knn.circuit_breaker.triggered *is set to *true.* The default value for this setting is *60% *of the machines total memory outside the Elasticsearch jvm . However, a value in *KB* can be given as well.\n \n+###### Example\n+If a machine has 100GB RAM. Elasticsearch jvm uses 32GB. Then the default circuit breaker limit is set at 60% of the remaining memory(60% of (100GB -32GB) = 40.8GB)\n \n-curl -X PUT \"localhost:9200/myindex/_doc/4\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'\n+##### knn.circuit_breaker.triggered\n+This setting indicates whether  or not the circuit breaker has been triggered. The circuit breaker is triggered if any node in the cluster has had to evict an entry from the cache because the cache\u2019s capacity had been reached. The circuit breaker is untriggered when the size of the entries in the cache goes below *knn.circuit_breaker.unset.percentage. *This can occur when an index is deleted or entries in the cache expire when *knn.cache.item.expiry.enabled* is true. The default value is *False.*\n+\n+##### knn.circuit_breaker.unset.percentage\n+This setting indicates under what percentage of the cache\u2019s total capacity the cache\u2019s current size must be in order to untrigger the circuit breaker. The default value is *75% *of total cache\u2019s capacit*y.*\n+\n+###### Example\n+```\n+PUT /_cluster/settings\n {\n-\"my_vector\" : [5.5, 6.5],\n-\"price\":17\n+    \"persistent\" : {\n+        \"knn.plugin.enabled\" : true,\n+        \"knn.algo_param.index_thread_qty\" : 1,\n+        \"knn.cache.item.expiry.enabled\": true,\n+        \"knn.cache.item.expiry.minutes\": 15,\n+        \"knn.memory.circuit_breaker.enabled\" : true,\n+        \"knn.memory.circuit_breaker.limit\" : \"55%\",\n+        \"knn.circuit_breaker.unset.percentage\": 23\n+    }\n }\n-'\n+```\n+\n+## Stats\n+The KNN Stats API provides information about the current status of the KNN Plugin.

If it is disabled, a user will not be able to index knn_vector fields nor run KNN queries. The default value is *true.*\n+\n+##### knn.algo_param.index_thread_qty\n+This setting specifies how many threads the NMS library should use to create the graph in memory. By default, the NMS library sets this value to the number of cores the machine has. However, because ES can spawn the same number of threads for searching, this could lead to (number of cores)^2 threads running and lead to 100% CPU utilization. The default value is *1.*\n+\n+#### Cache\n+The KNN Plugin uses a Guava cache to keep track of the graphs currently loaded into native memory. When a query is run against a graph for the first time, the graph is loaded into native memory (outside the Java heap). Because Elasticsearch runs inside of the JVM, it cannot manage native memory directly. So, it keeps track of native memory by adding an entry into a Guava cache that contains the pointer to the graph in native memory and how much memory it uses.  The cache\u2019s weight just means how much native memory all of the elements in the cache are taking up. If the maximum weight (this value is set by *knn.memory.circuit_breaker.limit*) of the cache is exceeded when it tries to load a graph into memory, the cache evicts an entry to make room for the new entry. Additionally, the cache can evict entries based on how long it has been since they were last accessed. \n+\n+##### knn.cache.item.expiry.enabled\n+This setting indicates that the cache should evict entries that have expired (not been accessed for *knn.cache.item.expiry.minutes*). The default value is *false.*\n+\n+##### knn.cache.item.expiry.minutes\n+This setting indicates how long an item can be in the cache without being accessed before it expires. When an entry expires, it gets evicted from the cache. The default value is *180 minutes.*\n+\n+#### Circuit Breaker\n+For KNN, the circuit breaker is used to indicate when performance may degrade because the graphs loaded into native memory are reaching the cluster\u2019s total limits. Currently, the system does not perform any action once this limit is reached.\n+\n+##### knn.memory.circuit_breaker.enabled\n+This setting enables or disables the circuit breaker feature.  Disabling this setting will keep you at risk of Out of memory as we do not have control on the memory usage for the graphs. The default value is *true*. \n+\n+##### knn.memory.circuit_breaker.limit\n+This setting indicates the maximum capacity of the cache. When the cache attempts to load in a graph that exceeds this limit, it is forced to evict an entry and *knn.circuit_breaker.triggered *is set to *true.* The default value for this setting is *60% *of the machines total memory outside the Elasticsearch jvm . However, a value in *KB* can be given as well.\n \n+###### Example\n+If a machine has 100GB RAM. Elasticsearch jvm uses 32GB. Then the default circuit breaker limit is set at 60% of the remaining memory(60% of (100GB -32GB) = 40.8GB)\n \n-curl -X PUT \"localhost:9200/myindex/_doc/4\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'\n+##### knn.circuit_breaker.triggered\n+This setting indicates whether  or not the circuit breaker has been triggered. The circuit breaker is triggered if any node in the cluster has had to evict an entry from the cache because the cache\u2019s capacity had been reached. The circuit breaker is untriggered when the size of the entries in the cache goes below *knn.circuit_breaker.unset.percentage. *This can occur when an index is deleted or entries in the cache expire when *knn.cache.item.expiry.enabled* is true. The default value is *False.*\n+\n+##### knn.circuit_breaker.unset.percentage\n+This setting indicates under what percentage of the cache\u2019s total capacity the cache\u2019s current size must be in order to untrigger the circuit breaker.

If it is disabled, a user will not be able to index knn_vector fields nor run KNN queries. The default value is *true.*\n+\n+##### knn.algo_param.index_thread_qty\n+This setting specifies how many threads the NMS library should use to create the graph in memory. By default, the NMS library sets this value to the number of cores the machine has. However, because ES can spawn the same number of threads for searching, this could lead to (number of cores)^2 threads running and lead to 100% CPU utilization. The default value is *1.*\n+\n+#### Cache\n+The KNN Plugin uses a Guava cache to keep track of the graphs currently loaded into native memory. When a query is run against a graph for the first time, the graph is loaded into native memory (outside the Java heap). Because Elasticsearch runs inside of the JVM, it cannot manage native memory directly. So, it keeps track of native memory by adding an entry into a Guava cache that contains the pointer to the graph in native memory and how much memory it uses.  The cache\u2019s weight just means how much native memory all of the elements in the cache are taking up. If the maximum weight (this value is set by *knn.memory.circuit_breaker.limit*) of the cache is exceeded when it tries to load a graph into memory, the cache evicts an entry to make room for the new entry. Additionally, the cache can evict entries based on how long it has been since they were last accessed. \n+\n+##### knn.cache.item.expiry.enabled\n+This setting indicates that the cache should evict entries that have expired (not been accessed for *knn.cache.item.expiry.minutes*). The default value is *false.*\n+\n+##### knn.cache.item.expiry.minutes\n+This setting indicates how long an item can be in the cache without being accessed before it expires. When an entry expires, it gets evicted from the cache. The default value is *180 minutes.*\n+\n+#### Circuit Breaker\n+For KNN, the circuit breaker is used to indicate when performance may degrade because the graphs loaded into native memory are reaching the cluster\u2019s total limits. Currently, the system does not perform any action once this limit is reached.\n+\n+##### knn.memory.circuit_breaker.enabled\n+This setting enables or disables the circuit breaker feature.  Disabling this setting will keep you at risk of Out of memory as we do not have control on the memory usage for the graphs. The default value is *true*. \n+\n+##### knn.memory.circuit_breaker.limit\n+This setting indicates the maximum capacity of the cache. When the cache attempts to load in a graph that exceeds this limit, it is forced to evict an entry and *knn.circuit_breaker.triggered *is set to *true.* The default value for this setting is *60% *of the machines total memory outside the Elasticsearch jvm . However, a value in *KB* can be given as well.\n \n+###### Example", "originalCommit": "0ccc72dceed619ad97fee8fc058642f0f4a3f35c", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3NjY2MjM4OQ==", "url": "https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/k-NN/pull/44#discussion_r376662389", "bodyText": "Should we have one example showing index creation with multiple knn_vector fields?", "author": "vamshin", "createdAt": "2020-02-08T00:04:47Z", "path": "README.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -57,89 +53,223 @@ The following code creates a KNN index with fields my_vector1, my_vector2, my_ve\n ```\n PUT /myindex\n {\n-  \"settings\" : {\n-    \"index\": {\n-      \"knn\": true\n+    \"settings\" : {\n+        \"number_of_shards\" :   1,\n+        \"number_of_replicas\" : 0,\n+        \"index\": {\n+            \"knn\": true\n+        }\n+    },\n+    \"mappings\": {\n+        \"properties\": {\n+            \"my_vector\": {\n+                \"type\": \"knn_vector\",\n+                \"dimension\": 2\n+            }\n+        }\n     }", "originalCommit": "0ccc72dceed619ad97fee8fc058642f0f4a3f35c", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3NjgwMzc4Mg==", "url": "https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/k-NN/pull/44#discussion_r376803782", "bodyText": "Will update thanks", "author": "jmazanec15", "createdAt": "2020-02-09T18:18:34Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3NjY2MjM4OQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3Njc5OTMwNw==", "url": "https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/k-NN/pull/44#discussion_r376799307", "bodyText": "we can remove these settings?", "author": "vamshin", "createdAt": "2020-02-09T17:09:41Z", "path": "README.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -57,89 +53,223 @@ The following code creates a KNN index with fields my_vector1, my_vector2, my_ve\n ```\n PUT /myindex\n {\n-  \"settings\" : {\n-    \"index\": {\n-      \"knn\": true\n+    \"settings\" : {\n+        \"number_of_shards\" :   1,\n+        \"number_of_replicas\" : 0,", "originalCommit": "0ccc72dceed619ad97fee8fc058642f0f4a3f35c", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3NjgwMjU2Nw==", "url": "https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/k-NN/pull/44#discussion_r376802567", "bodyText": "Will remove thanks", "author": "jmazanec15", "createdAt": "2020-02-09T18:01:50Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3Njc5OTMwNw=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3NjgwMDY0OQ==", "url": "https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/k-NN/pull/44#discussion_r376800649", "bodyText": "we should remove index from setting as we already wrapped settings in index?\nIt should be\n\"index\" : {\n        \"knn.algo_param.m\": 18, \n        \"knn.algo_param.ef_search\" : 20,\n        \"knn.algo_param.ef_construction\" : 40\n}", "author": "vamshin", "createdAt": "2020-02-09T17:31:58Z", "path": "README.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -57,89 +53,223 @@ The following code creates a KNN index with fields my_vector1, my_vector2, my_ve\n ```\n PUT /myindex\n {\n-  \"settings\" : {\n-    \"index\": {\n-      \"knn\": true\n+    \"settings\" : {\n+        \"number_of_shards\" :   1,\n+        \"number_of_replicas\" : 0,\n+        \"index\": {\n+            \"knn\": true\n+        }\n+    },\n+    \"mappings\": {\n+        \"properties\": {\n+            \"my_vector\": {\n+                \"type\": \"knn_vector\",\n+                \"dimension\": 2\n+            }\n+        }\n     }\n-  },\n-  \"mappings\": {\n-    \"my_images\": {\n-      \"properties\": {\n-        \"my_vector1\": {\n-          \"type\": \"knn_vector\"\n-        },\n-        \"my_vector2\": {\n-          \"type\": \"knn_vector\"\n-        },\n-        \"my_vector3\": {\n-        \"type\": \"knn_vector\"\n-      }\n-    }\n-  }\n }\n ```\n \n * Indexing sample docs to KNN index\n \n ```\n-curl -X POST \"localhost:9200/myindex/_doc/1\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'\n+PUT /myindex/_doc/2?refresh=true\n {\n-\"my_vector\" : [1.5, 2.5],\n-\"price\":10\n+    \"my_vector\" : [1.5, 2.5],\n+    \"price\":10\n }\n-'\n+```\n+\n+* Querying K-Nearest neighbors\n \n-curl -X PUT \"localhost:9200/myindex/_doc/2\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'\n+```\n+POST /myindex/_search\n {\n-\"my_vector\" : [2.5, 3.5],\n-\"price\":12\n+    \"size\" : 10,\n+    \"query\": {\n+        \"knn\": {\n+            \"my_vector\": {\n+                \"vector\": [3, 4],\n+                \"k\": 2\n+            }\n+        }\n+    }\n }\n-'\n+```\n+\n+## Java Native library usage\n+For plugin installations from archive(.zip), it is necessary to ensure ```.so``` file for linux OS and ```.jnilib``` file for Mac OS are present in the java library path.
