Lucene's IndexSearcher will search over all of the segments in a shard to find the 'size' best results. But, because the complexity of search for the HNSW algorithm is logarithmic with respect to the number of vectors, searching over 5 graphs with a 100 vectors each and then taking the top size results from ```5*k``` results will take longer than searching over 1 graph with 500 vectors and then taking the top size results from k results. \n+Ideally having 1 segment per shard will give the optimal performance with respect to search latency. We could configure index to have multiple shards to aviod having giant shards and achieve more parallelism.\n+\n+We can control the number of segments either during indexing by asking Elasticsearch to slow down the segment creation by disabling the refresh interval or choosing larger refresh interval.\n+\n+### Warm up\n+\n+The graphs are constructed during indexing, but they are loaded into memory during the first search. The way search works in Lucene is that each segment is searched sequentially (so, for k-NN, each segment returns up to k nearest neighbors of the query point) and the results are aggregated together and ranked based on the score of each result (higher score --> better result). \n+\n+Once a graph is loaded(graphs are loaded outside Elasticsearch JVM), we cache the graphs in memory. So the initial queries would be expensive in the order of few seconds and subsequent queries should be faster in the order of milliseconds(assuming knn circuit breaker is not hit).\n+\n+In order to avoid this latency penalty during your first queries, a user should use the warmup API on the indices they want to search. The API looks like this:\n+\n+GET /_opendistro/_knn/warmup/index1,index2,index3?pretty\n+{\n+  \"_shards\" : {\n+    \"total\" : 6,\n+    \"successful\" : 6,\n+    \"failed\" : 0\n+  }\n+}\n+\n+The API loads all of the graphs for all of the shards (primaries and replicas) for the specified indices into the cache. Thus, there will be no penalty to load graphs during initial searches. *Note \u2014 * this API only loads the segments of the indices it sees into the cache. If a merge or refresh operation finishes after this API is ran or if new documents are added, this API will need to be re-ran to load those graphs into memory.\n+\n+### Avoid reading stored fields\n+\n+If the use case is to just read the nearest neighbors Ids and scores, then we could disable reading stored fields which could save some time retrieving the vectors from stored fields. \n+To understand more about stored fields, \n+please refer this [page.](https://discuss.elastic.co/t/what-does-it-mean-to-store-a-field/5893/5)\n+```\n+{\n+ \"size\": 5,\n+ \"stored_fields\": \"_none_\",\n+ \"docvalue_fields\": [\"_id\"],\n+ \"query\": {\n+   \"knn\": {\n+    \"v\": {\n+      \"vector\": [-0.16490704,-0.047262248,-0.078923926],\n+      \"k\": 50\n+     }       \n+   }\n+ }\n+}\n+```\n+##Improving Recall ", "originalCommit": "330076a7c161280ab679c26226c2f44ec1e19d5a", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2MTgyNjk4MQ==", "url": "https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/k-NN/pull/177#discussion_r461826981", "bodyText": "Done", "author": "vamshin", "createdAt": "2020-07-28T19:39:23Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2MTc5NTU2MQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2MTc5NTYzOQ==", "url": "https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/k-NN/pull/177#discussion_r461795639", "bodyText": "Add space", "author": "jmazanec15", "createdAt": "2020-07-28T18:45:17Z", "path": "PerformanceTuning.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,157 @@\n+#KNN Performance Tuning\n+\n+\n+In this document we provide recommendations for performance tuning to improve indexing/search performance with the k-NN plugin.

Lucene's IndexSearcher will search over all of the segments in a shard to find the 'size' best results. But, because the complexity of search for the HNSW algorithm is logarithmic with respect to the number of vectors, searching over 5 graphs with a 100 vectors each and then taking the top size results from ```5*k``` results will take longer than searching over 1 graph with 500 vectors and then taking the top size results from k results. \n+Ideally having 1 segment per shard will give the optimal performance with respect to search latency. We could configure index to have multiple shards to aviod having giant shards and achieve more parallelism.\n+\n+We can control the number of segments either during indexing by asking Elasticsearch to slow down the segment creation by disabling the refresh interval or choosing larger refresh interval.\n+\n+### Warm up\n+\n+The graphs are constructed during indexing, but they are loaded into memory during the first search. The way search works in Lucene is that each segment is searched sequentially (so, for k-NN, each segment returns up to k nearest neighbors of the query point) and the top ```size``` number of results based on the score would be returned from all of the results returned by segements at a shard level(higher score --> better result). \n+\n+Once a graph is loaded(graphs are loaded outside Elasticsearch JVM), we cache the graphs in memory. So the initial queries would be expensive in the order of few seconds and subsequent queries should be faster in the order of milliseconds(assuming knn circuit breaker is not hit).\n+\n+In order to avoid this latency penalty during your first queries, a user should use the warmup API on the indices they want to search. The API looks like this:\n+\n+GET /_opendistro/_knn/warmup/index1,index2,index3?pretty", "originalCommit": "d0e889c7428d6c059236bacdaa0ffeb6055301c1", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2MTg5MDkxMw==", "url": "https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/k-NN/pull/177#discussion_r461890913", "bodyText": "Done", "author": "vamshin", "createdAt": "2020-07-28T21:29:21Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2MTg4NjA5Ng=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2MTg4NjM4Ng==", "url": "https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/k-NN/pull/177#discussion_r461886386", "bodyText": "Minor: add \".\" after numbering", "author": "jmazanec15", "createdAt": "2020-07-28T21:20:09Z", "path": "PerformanceTuning.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,154 @@\n+# KNN Performance Tuning\n+\n+In this document we provide recommendations for performance tuning to improve indexing/search performance with the k-NN plugin.
