That avoids having to persist additional data, particularly since we'd only be persisting it for a very narrow UI concern.\nIn addition, because a Job document may encompass multiple steps, and each step may be associated with a different entity type, we can't have a single \"targetEntityType\" on a Job document, because we may need multiple values.\nBut the RunFlowResponse returned by running a step has a Map of step responses, so we can have a targetEntityType on each step response (if one exists).\nWe also have multiple scenarios to account for here - 1) running a mapping step with a legacy mapping (can't happen in HC, but we need to account for it); 2) running a mapping step via HC; 3) running a matching/merging/mastering step that currently uses \"targetEntity\" instead of \"targetEntityType\". Regardless of the approach we take, we need to account for all of these scenarios so that users aren't confused when targetEntityType is only set some of the time.\nI recommend opening up a backend task for this, as we'll need to properly define it for the scenarios listed above.", "author": "rjrudin", "createdAt": "2020-06-22T16:13:08Z", "path": "marklogic-data-hub-central/ui/src/pages/Run.tsx", "diffHunk": "@@ -317,19 +338,25 @@ const Run = (props) => {\n                         return axios.get('/api/jobs/' + jobId);\n                     }, pollConfig.interval)\n                     .then(function(response: any) {\n+                        let entityName;", "originalCommit": "0bb003755e6e0e23fee909a3d906797c1b398ea5", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0MzY5Mjc1MA==", "url": "https://github.com/marklogic/marklogic-data-hub/pull/4123#discussion_r443692750", "bodyText": "@rjrudin This was done by me as a backend task and the commits have since been squashed.
