More verbose names are also useful when searching for references to functions/classes/etc, as you get fewer false positives. So let's not do \"src\" and \"tgt\" - let's use \"source\" and \"target\", the same words we normally use (using these abbreviations also raises the question of why we abbreviate some words but not others - like if we're doing src/tgt, why not do colls instead of collections? Not abbreviating means we don't have to think through that or explain it).", "author": "rjrudin", "createdAt": "2020-05-27T21:24:33Z", "path": "marklogic-data-hub-central/ui/src/components/advanced-settings/advanced-settings-dialog.module.scss", "diffHunk": "@@ -76,6 +83,18 @@ span.readOnlyLabel {\n     margin-bottom: 8px !important;\n }\n \n+.formItemTgtCollections { ", "originalCommit": "1d69fdbf93946094ca9c49cbbc1bc0093b9aea26", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzMTQ5NTc4OQ==", "url": "https://github.com/marklogic/marklogic-data-hub/pull/4005#discussion_r431495789", "bodyText": "Done", "author": "xnikhil08", "createdAt": "2020-05-27T23:17:51Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzMTQ1MTEwOA=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzMTQ1MjU0MA==", "url": "https://github.com/marklogic/marklogic-data-hub/pull/4005#discussion_r431452540", "bodyText": "Same thing here - let's do provenanceGranularityOptions. A benefit - let's say someone wants to search the codebase for all references to granularity options. One approach would be to search for \"granularity\", ignoring case.
