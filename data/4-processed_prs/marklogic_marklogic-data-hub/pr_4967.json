The assertion messages can state that we expect the step to not fail, even though fine is not supported for a mapping step.", "author": "rjrudin", "createdAt": "2020-12-09T13:44:25Z", "path": "marklogic-data-hub/src/test/resources/test-projects/provenance-test/flows/inline.flow.json", "diffHunk": "@@ -29,6 +29,7 @@\n           \"name\": \"SimpleCustomerMapping\",\n           \"version\": 1\n         },\n+        \"provenanceGranularityLevel\": \"fine\",", "originalCommit": "afaa84c4394b4cae4696e7172ee14ee4cd346ea3", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "3d478ea891f132145984158960f4afb946858841", "url": "https://github.com/marklogic/marklogic-data-hub/commit/3d478ea891f132145984158960f4afb946858841", "message": "DHFPROD-6231:Mapping step fails when provenance is set to \"fine\"", "committedDate": "2020-12-09T18:59:06Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"oid": "be6236e85a4334e66bf36cc3667c4c569fc3dab3", "url": "https://github.com/marklogic/marklogic-data-hub/commit/be6236e85a4334e66bf36cc3667c4c569fc3dab3", "message": "DHFPROD-6231:Mapping step fails when provenance is set to \"fine\"", "committedDate": "2020-12-10T21:42:44Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "be6236e85a4334e66bf36cc3667c4c569fc3dab3", "url": "https://github.com/marklogic/marklogic-data-hub/commit/be6236e85a4334e66bf36cc3667c4c569fc3dab3", "message": "DHFPROD-6231:Mapping step fails when provenance is set to \"fine\"", "committedDate": "2020-12-10T21:42:44Z", "type": "forcePushed"}]}
