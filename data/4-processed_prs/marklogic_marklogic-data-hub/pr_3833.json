Also, the \"skipWeb\" property is included to avoid building the QuickStart application in \n+the \"./web\" directory, which can require a couple minutes to complete. \n+\n+Now, you just need to make a build.gradle file that uses this version of the Data Hub Gradle plugin that you published. \n+For example, if you're working on the develop branch for the 5.3.0 release, then when you publish the DH Gradle plugin, \n+it will have a version of 5.3-SNAPSHOT.
