Amps are a way to grant temporary roles inside a designated function. The function can then institute guardrails to ensure the roles are only used for the narrow intended purpose.

For other privileges, consider if the privilege can be used beyond the intended purpose. Where possible use granular privileges (See [Granular Privileges](https://docs.marklogic.com/guide/security/granular)). If the user role can't use granular privileges and the required privilege would be too broad, (1) a new narrow execute privilege should be created, (2) the function that requires the privilege should check for the narrow privilege, and (3) the function should be amped with the broader privilege.\n+\n+Roles to be used with amps should be suffixed with `-internal` to indicate that the role is used for amps and NOT intended to be assigned to users.\n+\n+## Data Hub Roles and Privileges\n+\n+### data-hub-common\n+\n+Data Hub role containing the common privileges across Data Hub roles.\n+\n+#### Inherited Roles\n+ - data-hub-module-reader\n+ - rest-reader\n+\n+#### Privileges\n+\n+Privilege | Notes\n+---------|----------\n+ xdmp-eval-in | Required to specify database for REST Client.
