Whereas, STOP_EXECUTION did not have any handling -- i.e. all tasks in execution were treated like any other in-progress tasks, and were being tracked until the completion (In pre Kafka 2.4.* versions, the role of STOP_EXECUTION was just avoid submitting a new batch of execution and wait for the completion of the ongoing batch).\nHowever, the current logic in the initial version of this patch was incomplete. More specifically, we should handle the rollback for gracefully stopped inter-broker replica reassignments. And also we should avoid running a rollback for force-stopped executions -- i.e. they are already handled without rollback.\nI updated the handling logic along with comments to explain the reasoning.
