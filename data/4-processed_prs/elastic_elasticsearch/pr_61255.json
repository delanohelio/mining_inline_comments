For instance, this can happen if a node briefly leaves the cluster\nholding a primary with no in-sync replicas.\n\nThe message in this case is typically as follows:\n\n    obtaining shard lock timed out after 5000ms, previous lock details: [shard creation] trying to lock for [shard creation]\n\nThis is pretty hard to interpret, and doesn't raise the important\nquestion: \"why didn't the shard shut down sooner?\"\n\nWith this change we reword the message a bit, report the age of the\nshard lock, and adjust the details to report that the lock is held by a\nclosing shard:\n\n    obtaining shard lock for [starting shard] timed out after [5000ms], lock already held for [closing shard] with age [12345ms]\n\nRelates #38807", "committedDate": "2020-08-18T08:58:34Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ3MjA1OTMzMA==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/61255#discussion_r472059330", "bodyText": "NIT: setDetails(details);", "author": "original-brownbear", "createdAt": "2020-08-18T09:55:00Z", "path": "server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/env/NodeEnvironment.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -854,17 +860,23 @@ private void decWaitCount() {\n         void acquire(long timeoutInMillis, final String details) throws ShardLockObtainFailedException {\n             try {\n                 if (mutex.tryAcquire(timeoutInMillis, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)) {\n-                    lockDetails = details;\n+                    lockDetails = Tuple.tuple(System.nanoTime(), details);", "originalCommit": "00666f4a2f2a898556143ff9c3c50b3c227606b5", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "ab94d42dbbc66c46405d911a4483593b0c0acb4a", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/ab94d42dbbc66c46405d911a4483593b0c0acb4a", "message": "Merge branch 'master' into 2020-08-18-log-shard-lock-age", "committedDate": "2020-08-18T09:59:49Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "48bf874ec27eb0a8debd30d6a798331c155249e8", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/48bf874ec27eb0a8debd30d6a798331c155249e8", "message": "CR", "committedDate": "2020-08-18T10:00:42Z", "type": "commit"}]}
