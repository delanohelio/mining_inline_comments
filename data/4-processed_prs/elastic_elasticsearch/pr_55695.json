This seems to do the opposite. It's unclear from my reading of this PR what this method actually does, since there are no example or test implementations, but based on the one use inside Node, it seems like this is used as a way to callback to actually add the breaker to the CircuitBreakerService. I think the root of the problem is CircuitBreakerService should not have a registerBreaker method. Instead, Node should collect all the breaker settings, and pass them to the service's ctor, as we don't need the ability to add these dynamically.\nAdditionally, the BreakerSettings concept seems like it needs a little work to make this all truly extendable. Currently it takes in all the values, but the plugin must read these values on its own, and the getCircuitBreakers() method above then relies on the plugin having Settings from its ctor, which cannot be relied on. Even if we passed the real Settings to getCircuitBreakers(), it seems opposite of what we want. IMO any new breakers that are added should be configurable in the same way our existing breakers are configured, ie through the same yaml settings with the new breaker name substituted.  This would mean replacing the hardcoded settings that exist for the builtin breakers with affix settings, so that they can be used with any breaker.", "author": "rjernst", "createdAt": "2020-04-27T16:45:44Z", "path": "server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/plugins/CircuitMemoryBreakerPlugin.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,53 @@\n+/*\n+ * Licensed to Elasticsearch under one or more contributor\n+ * license agreements.

There are ways to make the writing use locking but the read side, which is more common, not slow down. Also, after looking at the register method again, I've noticed the comment noting registering the same name replaces the existing breaker. This is leniency which I think makes having this available to plugins error prone. What if two plugins provide the same breaker name? Then the plugin registration order matters, and one  silently replaces the other. This is yet another reason I think we need to statically define the breakers at node startup, but still have them available.\n\nHow can different plugins provide their appropriate setting defaults?\n\nThis is a good point and something I hadn't considered. There are ways around this though. For example, in ScriptService we now use affix settings for context specific cache values, where the defaults for those are defined in the contexts themselves (ie like circuit breakers types here). It means the default defined in the setting is ignored and we apply the defaults dynamically based on whether the setting exists, rather than calling setting.get always.", "author": "rjernst", "createdAt": "2020-04-29T20:44:06Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQxNTk3NTk5Ng=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQxODI3MzYzMw==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/55695#discussion_r418273633", "bodyText": "There are ways to make the writing use locking but the read side, which is more common, not slow down.\n\nKeeping the reference the same across threads will require overhead & limit to be volatile on read no?
