We can set up the snapshot directly in one single step to simplify the state machine.\n\nThis is a big help for building concurrent snapshots because it allows us to establish a deterministic order of operations between snapshot create and delete operations since all of their entries now contain a repository generation. With this change simple queuing up of snapshot operations can and will be added in a follow-up.", "committedDate": "2020-07-12T21:35:22Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "81e2b9bfebe037b3cb055cb383c6d5a2d8621f33", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/81e2b9bfebe037b3cb055cb383c6d5a2d8621f33", "message": "backport missing piece", "committedDate": "2020-07-13T08:37:54Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ1MzUwNTEyOQ==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/59374#discussion_r453505129", "bodyText": "This and the other *Legacy method rename (and the way they're selectively called from the transport action) is the only real difference between this commit and the original one that went into master.
