In case of this transport\naction it was specifically moved to the `MANAGEMENT` thread to avoid the high cost of processing\nthe stats requests on the nodes during fan-out but that did not cover the final execution\non the node that received the initial request.", "committedDate": "2020-09-22T10:05:39Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "9a9095fda727c0173d35a1b9eade2b66811b24d4", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/9a9095fda727c0173d35a1b9eade2b66811b24d4", "message": "Merge remote-tracking branch 'elastic/master' into fix-mapping-monitoring-serialization", "committedDate": "2020-09-24T10:35:46Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "19028898559535391b3c8ba21a12dc104b0e876e", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/19028898559535391b3c8ba21a12dc104b0e876e", "message": "adjust to be more specific", "committedDate": "2020-09-24T10:55:21Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5NTg3MjE5OQ==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/62753#discussion_r495872199", "bodyText": "nit: this reintroduces double firing the listener if listener.onResponse fails (will also invoke onFailure now).

The problem here is, that we really need this safe-guard here I think. Otherwise an exception in listener.onResponse (highly likely a bug in the transport code but still) would lead to the request never getting a response back leaking memory on the caller. We have the same issue when we run this on the same thread actually (the transport handler upstream brings the exception back around to the listener in that case).\n-> no easy fix here for now I'm afraid. But I do think we should look into adding more assertions for this kind of thing to ActionRunnable like you did to ActionListener.map and clean these things up more for sure.", "author": "original-brownbear", "createdAt": "2020-09-28T11:57:39Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5NTg3MjE5OQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "7fba4787d4254e824dd7dfb52294459430790aa0", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/7fba4787d4254e824dd7dfb52294459430790aa0", "message": "Merge remote-tracking branch 'elastic/master' into fix-mapping-monitoring-serialization", "committedDate": "2020-09-28T11:59:53Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "474d4cbb5b3188b50ad8cbfd31be3be191c4088c", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/474d4cbb5b3188b50ad8cbfd31be3be191c4088c", "message": "assert not on transport thread", "committedDate": "2020-09-28T12:02:51Z", "type": "commit"}]}
