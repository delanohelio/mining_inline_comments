Last time I added\nids = Strings.hasText(id) == false ? null : new String[] { id };\n\nin the constructor with StreamInput. Looking back now, this introduced a tiny inconsistency of how empty id is handled in different constructors. Your change here fixed this inconsistency. Thanks!\nNow I have a new question: since a single empty string is now handled and excluded from the constructor, should we also apply the empty check for the string array of ids, i.e., should we move the validation logic of ids into here as well? On one hand, relocating the check for ids is good for consistency in that validate() is more about interactions between multiple fields. On the other hand, it complicates the constructors and also could be considered as a slight behaviour change.
