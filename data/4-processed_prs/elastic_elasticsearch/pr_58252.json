read/write lock is over complication.  The things that are going on inside the locked sections of code are very simple operations.  In my experience you need to be doing a lot of stuff in the locked sections to make the cost of a read/write lock worthwhile.  The amount of work the lock is doing to ensure fairness probably dwarfs the amount of work in these methods.  Then each LongAdder is doing its own synchronization internally too.  It is probably the case that it would be more efficient to simply make all the methods that use the read/write lock synchronized, replace the LongAdders with simple longs, and just use ++ to increment them.", "author": "droberts195", "createdAt": "2020-06-18T10:49:46Z", "path": "x-pack/plugin/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/xpack/core/ml/inference/trainedmodel/InferenceStats.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -263,6 +289,15 @@ public Accumulator incFailure() {\n             }\n         }\n \n+        public Accumulator incCacheMiss() {\n+            readWriteLock.readLock().lock();", "originalCommit": "352f3b2157cb8bf07211dc7d9147f3c09ff4ec7e", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0MjE2NzExMA==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/58252#discussion_r442167110", "bodyText": "I will do some measurements and see which is better :)", "author": "benwtrent", "createdAt": "2020-06-18T11:48:40Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0MjEzODY5NQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0MjI5OTk1MA==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/58252#discussion_r442299950", "bodyText": "Yet again, it is better to measure before making a decision about \"what is faster\".\nHere are average microsecond timed benchmarks for 1 and 128 threads.\nexample code:\nfor (int i = 1; i < 100_001; ++i) {\n    bh.consume(accumulator.incMissingFields().incFailure().incInference());\n}\n\nThe scenario was the BEST cast scenario for the RW lock (only ever doing increments, and never resetting with a full write lock).\nBenchmark                                                   Mode  Cnt        Score        Error  Units\nMultiThreadedStatsAccumulatorBenchmark.rwAccumulator_1      avgt   20     5957.399 \u00b1    112.892  us/op\nMultiThreadedStatsAccumulatorBenchmark.rwAccumulator_128    avgt   20  7480921.908 \u00b1 255364.820  us/op\nMultiThreadedStatsAccumulatorBenchmark.syncAccumulator_1    avgt   20      421.662 \u00b1      2.616  us/op\nMultiThreadedStatsAccumulatorBenchmark.syncAccumulator_128  avgt   20   792910.927 \u00b1  52219.577  us/op\n\nfull benchmark code: https://gist.github.com/benwtrent/b74254bf64aba0c55d4b24a474f9eff1\n@droberts195 ^", "author": "benwtrent", "createdAt": "2020-06-18T15:09:10Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0MjEzODY5NQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0MjMwMzUxNg==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/58252#discussion_r442303516", "bodyText": "Yes, that tallies with what I've always seen in the past, which is that you have to do a lot of work in the locked sections for the benefit of an RW lock to outweigh the complexity of its internal code.\nUp to you if you want to change it in this PR or a different one though.", "author": "droberts195", "createdAt": "2020-06-18T15:14:32Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0MjEzODY5NQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "f94ca472877bc099f8f942363e49f77e5dc69d14", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/f94ca472877bc099f8f942363e49f77e5dc69d14", "message": "addressing pr comments", "committedDate": "2020-06-18T12:08:04Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "fa74013e6360975b3e546c915d4cfad51411d173", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/fa74013e6360975b3e546c915d4cfad51411d173", "message": "Merge remote-tracking branch 'upstream/master' into feature/ml-inference-count-cache-misses", "committedDate": "2020-06-18T12:08:09Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0MTczNDg2NA==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/58252#discussion_r441734864", "bodyText": "Could be higher than the number of items...\n\nCan we explain when/why this would be true?
