However, that was changed many\nrefactorings ago, but the complex support for registering a java home\nversion needed that fails at configuration time still exists. The only\nremaining use of grabbing java home is within bwc tests, and must be at\nruntime since that is when we have the checkout and know what version is\nneeded.\n\nThis commit consolidates the java home finding method into a utility\nunassociated with BuildPlugin.", "committedDate": "2020-04-22T23:34:39Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "f8d516f86649d8c359b779dbe3c03249dd88f511", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/f8d516f86649d8c359b779dbe3c03249dd88f511", "message": "fix checkstyle", "committedDate": "2020-04-22T23:48:12Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQxMzQ1MzExMw==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/55635#discussion_r413453113", "bodyText": "This could be simplified to java.orElseThrow(() -> new GradleException(\"message\"))", "author": "mark-vieira", "createdAt": "2020-04-23T01:58:42Z", "path": "buildSrc/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/gradle/util/JavaUtil.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,42 @@\n+/*\n+ * Licensed to Elasticsearch under one or more contributor\n+ * license agreements.
