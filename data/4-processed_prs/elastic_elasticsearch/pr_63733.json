Boosting a\nfield does not imply that it is more important relative to other fields.\nIt simply means that the score is multiplied by the supplied boost\nvalue. Due to the differences in each field's term and document\nstatistics, it's not possible to imply relative importance of fields\nbased on the per-field boost value alone.", "committedDate": "2020-10-15T12:30:58Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwNTUyNTgwNA==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/63733#discussion_r505525804", "bodyText": "Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n            <1> The `subject` field's score is multipled by three while the `message` field's score is\n          \n          \n            \n            unchanged.
