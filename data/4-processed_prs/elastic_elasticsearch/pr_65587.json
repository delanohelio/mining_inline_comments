With\ntraditional backups you take a large and relatively infrequent \"full\"\nbackup and then a sequence of smaller \"incremental\" ones, and this whole\nsequence of backups is required for a restore so it must be kept around\nuntil at least the next full backup. In contrast, Elasticsearch\nsnapshots are logically independent and each can be deleted without\naffecting the integrity of the others.\n\nThis distinction frequently causes confusion amongst newer users, so\nthis commit clarifies what we mean by \"incremental\" in the docs.", "committedDate": "2020-11-30T10:40:01Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUzMjU5NjE5OQ==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/65587#discussion_r532596199", "bodyText": "Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n            Snapshots are taken incrementally: the snapshotting process only copies data to\n          \n          \n            \n            {es} takes snapshots incrementally.
