The default implementation of\n`rewriteBuckets` throws the same exception that was thrown when you\nattempted to run a `SiblingPipelineAggregator` on an aggregation without\nbuckets. It is overridden by `InternalSingleBucketAggregation` and\n`InternalMultiBucketAggregation` to correctly rewrite their buckets.", "committedDate": "2020-03-04T22:52:10Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "9ae0c9d533f7c6b4969c5ef09e7f9ca137b4f8d8", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/9ae0c9d533f7c6b4969c5ef09e7f9ca137b4f8d8", "message": "Revert", "committedDate": "2020-03-05T00:18:57Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "4cd44217a9922aa3ba2a98790c0299d08152d6a2", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/4cd44217a9922aa3ba2a98790c0299d08152d6a2", "message": "Ooops", "committedDate": "2020-03-05T00:24:10Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "dfc9c2c9cafdf9c77e6c15447a26652a7978c72b", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/dfc9c2c9cafdf9c77e6c15447a26652a7978c72b", "message": "Merge branch 'master' into untwist_aggs", "committedDate": "2020-03-05T11:52:44Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4ODM3NDQzNg==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/53144#discussion_r388374436", "bodyText": "I believe this only skips sibling pipeline aggs?
