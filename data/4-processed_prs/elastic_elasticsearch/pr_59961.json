The most expensive of these weighed in at a\n+couple of kilobytes each. So for an aggregation like:\n+\n+----\n+POST _search\n+{\n+  \"aggs\": {\n+    \"date\": {\n+      \"date_histogram\": { \"field\": \"timestamp\", \"calendar_interval\": \"day\" },\n+      \"aggs\": {\n+        \"ips\": {\n+          \"terms\": { \"field\": \"ip\" }\n+        }\n+      }\n+    }\n+  }\n+}\n+----\n+\n+When run over three years, this aggregation spends a couple of megabytes\n+just on bucket accounting. More deeply nested aggregations spend even more\n+on this overhead. {es} {minor-version} removes all of this overhead, which\n+should allow us to run better in lower memory environments.\n+\n+As a bonus we wrote quite a few Rally benchmarks for aggregations to make\n+sure that these tests didn't slow down aggregations, so now we can think\n+much more scientifically about aggregation performance. The benchmarks\n+suggest that these changes don't affect simple aggregation trees and speed\n+up complex aggregation trees of similar or higher depth than the example\n+above.
