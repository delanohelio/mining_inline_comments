By formalization, I mean something like, have it in a separate class, place it in a shared package which is more accessible, name each feature more consistently (more on this below).\nIncluding Feature, we now have three different but related concepts: Feature, Setting, Plugin. Plugin seems to be the highest level, in that it provides one or multiple Features and Settings. I am not sure whether Feature has an 1-to-1 relationship with a Setting. If so, I feel the associated Setting should be reflected in this class and this could be useful for users to act accordingly.\nIf the relationship between Feature and Setting is more complex, e.g. a feature corresponds to multiple Settings working together, it may need to be more carefully defined and promoted to be a first level concept. I am a bit surprised that Feature is not already an existing concept since both Setting and Plugin sound too technical when talking to users, while Feature seem to be a more accessible term.\nI am aware that it is not something inherent to this PR so we don't need to solve it all with this PR. One possible actionable item is to move this class to a more common package for reuse by places other than security.", "author": "ywangd", "createdAt": "2020-02-27T07:35:22Z", "path": "x-pack/plugin/security/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/xpack/security/support/FeatureNotEnabledException.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,40 @@\n+/*\n+ * Copyright Elasticsearch B.V. and/or licensed to Elasticsearch B.V. under one\n+ * or more contributor license agreements.
