How are you currently building and publishing your images? Does Elastic have access to arm64 hardware that you will build the arm docker images on? Or are you planning on using qemu and  binfmt_misc to emulate the architectures so you can build all the images on x86 hardware?\nI am happy to lend a hand if you need when it comes to building multi-arch containers and building out manifests. Being at IBM, I do that quite a lot! \ud83d\ude04\nAre you planning on producing manifests for your arm64 and amd64 images? That would be really cool to see!!\nOne quick note with using qemu and  binfmt_misc is that there are some bugs you might run into. Images might seem like they built correctly, but when ran on the specific hardware you will run into errors. Hence why I encourage people to build on platform if they can. I am currently helping the Jenkins Docker team to build on platform for each of their images.
