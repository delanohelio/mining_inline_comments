This uses a bunch of memory. Exactly how much\nisn't clear but each `Aggregator` ends up making its own objects to read\ndoc values which have non-trivial buffers. And it forces all of it\nsub-aggregations to do the same. We allocate a new `Aggregator` per\nbucket for two reasons:\n\n1. We didn't have an appropriate data structure to track the\n   sub-ordinals of each parent bucket.\n2. You can only make a single call to `runDeferredCollections(long...)`\n   per `Aggregator` which was the only way to delay collection of\n   sub-aggregations.\n\nThis change adds a way to return \"deferred\" aggregations from any\nbucket aggregation and undefers them as part of regular collections.\nThis mechanism allows you to defer without\n`runDeferredCollections(long...)`.\n\nThis change also adds a fairly simplistic data structure to track the\nsub-ordinals for `long`-keyed buckets.\n\nIt uses both of those to power numeric `terms` aggregations and removes\nthe per-bucket allocation of their `Aggregator`. This fairly\nsubstantially reduces memory consumption of numeric `terms` aggregations\nthat are not the \"top level\", especially when those aggregations contain\nmany sub-aggregations.\n\nI picked numeric `terms` aggregations because those have the simplest\nimplementation. At least, I could kind of fit it in my head. And I\nhaven't fully understood the \"bytes\"-based terms aggregations, but I\nimagine I'll be able to make similar optimizations to them in follow up\nchanges.", "committedDate":
