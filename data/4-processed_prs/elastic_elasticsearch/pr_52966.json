It also checks the\nlicense level when parsing all analytics aggregations. This is how we\nwere checking them before but we did it in an easy to forget way. This\nway is slightly simpler, I think.", "committedDate": "2020-02-28T18:12:04Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4NjUwMTQ4Ng==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/52966#discussion_r386501486", "bodyText": "Having a trackFoo and getFooUsage for each aggregation seems like a lot of boiler plate to me.  If I was writing this, I'd make an enum of things to track, have an EnumMap of AtomicLongs, and just one track and one getUsage method which accept that enum as an additional argument.  EnumMap uses an efficient array implementation, so we wouldn't be paying much in overhead for that.   This would mean that adding a new counter to this class would just. require adding an entry to the enum, rather than also copying and modifying the track and get methods.
