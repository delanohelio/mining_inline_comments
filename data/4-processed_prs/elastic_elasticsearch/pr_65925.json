This means it\ncan't properly interpret a timestamp range filter in a query and must\ninvolve a copy of every shard in at least the `can_match` phase. It\ntherefore cannot cope with cases when shards are temporarily not started\neven if those shards are irrelevant to the search.\n\nThis commit captures the mapping of the `@timestamp` field for indices\nwhich expose a timestamp range in their index metadata.", "committedDate": "2020-12-07T07:44:38Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUzNzI5MzkyMA==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/65925#discussion_r537293920", "bodyText": "@pgomulka I've asked for you to take a look at this backport because this test is having trouble with locales and older JDK versions and I think you have expertise in this area.
