Whenever the name of a new index on\n+the remote cluster matches the auto-follow pattern, a corresponding follower\n+index is added to the local cluster.\n \n-With an auto-follow pattern, you reference the\n-<<ccr-getting-started-remote-cluster,remote cluster>> connected to your\n-local cluster. You must also specify a collection of patterns that match the\n-indices you want to automatically follow.\n+An auto-follow pattern specifies the remote cluster you want to replicate from,\n+and one or more index patterns that specify the rolling time series indices you\n+want to replicate. When the auto-follow pattern matches the specified index\n+pattern, {es} creates new time series indices on the remote cluster.", "originalCommit": "f982405a145614babf743f5db4c70f2be87477d9", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "8051f85a9e511b81a97e1ea279cda0c16c3ceebc", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/8051f85a9e511b81a97e1ea279cda0c16c3ceebc", "message": "Update docs/reference/ccr/getting-started.asciidoc\n\nCo-authored-by: debadair <debadair@elastic.co>", "committedDate": "2020-09-16T18:07:48Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "7a999edf0be412671d6fa9741ac75b125608d3fc", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/7a999edf0be412671d6fa9741ac75b125608d3fc", "message": "Merge branch 'master' into docs__ccr-tutorial-updates", "committedDate": "2020-09-16T18:51:25Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "fe6d047538a7391fc20081508ee1f262a18358f7", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/fe6d047538a7391fc20081508ee1f262a18358f7", "message": "Swapping GIF for mp4 hosted on web team CMS.", "committedDate": "2020-09-16T19:57:19Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "80b3239d23dba030afa1d0aac1fd2c5aa1e6ba54", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/80b3239d23dba030afa1d0aac1fd2c5aa1e6ba54", "message": "Merge branch 'docs__ccr-tutorial-updates' of github.com:lockewritesdocs/elasticsearch into docs__ccr-tutorial-updates", "committedDate": "2020-09-16T20:01:03Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "318d7da9c0ff2bf8694266ac34d3bfd6c5c7b971", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/318d7da9c0ff2bf8694266ac34d3bfd6c5c7b971", "message": "Removing GIF in favor of mp4.", "committedDate": "2020-09-16T20:01:30Z", "type": "commit"}]}
