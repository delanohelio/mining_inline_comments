This can lead to the request count\nmap containing a `null` for the request count key.\nThe assertion is not correct and we should not NPE here\n(as that might also hide the original exception since we are running this code in\na `finally` block from within the S3 SDK).\n\nCloses #61670", "committedDate": "2020-08-30T15:05:15Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ3OTc4NTE3Mw==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/61686#discussion_r479785173", "bodyText": "This has never happened on Cloud ever and I believe the original issue reporting this is likely some error with the credentials or an S3 SDK bug (can't reproduce it) but I still think we should log it as we really only get here if there's a problem.", "author": "original-brownbear", "createdAt": "2020-08-30T15:47:27Z", "path": "plugins/repository-s3/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/repositories/s3/S3BlobStore.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -105,8 +109,10 @@ public void collectMetrics(Request<?> request, Response<?> response) {\n     private long getRequestCount(Request<?> request) {\n         Number requestCount = request.getAWSRequestMetrics().getTimingInfo()\n             .getCounter(AWSRequestMetrics.Field.RequestCount.name());\n-        assert requestCount != null;\n-\n+        if (requestCount == null) {\n+            logger.warn(\"Expected request count to be tracked for request [{}] but found not count.\", request);", "originalCommit": "1139614f3be858b24801166ce9650304f5e3ebe1", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ3OTk1MzgwMQ==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/61686#discussion_r479953801", "bodyText": "Yes, that seems strange.
