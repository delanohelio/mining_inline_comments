S3-compatibility in\nthird-party systems has matured in recent years and users today report\nsuccess with a good number of them. In contrast, we effectively claim\nsupport for any old NFS implementation when used with the\nshared-filesystem repository.\n\nThis commit weakens this statement, removing the absolute claim of\nunsupportedness and instead spelling out that the user is responsible\nfor ironing out any incompatibilities with the storage supplier.", "committedDate": "2020-10-05T12:33:11Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwMzA5OTIyMA==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/63238#discussion_r503099220", "bodyText": "Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n            compatibility with S3.
