The test could fail for any number of reasons some including general infrastructure problems retrying would add noise.\nLooking at the test, in the setup it waits for the datafeed to complete before closing the job which should have prevented flush happening after the job failed.\n\n  \n    \n      elasticsearch/x-pack/plugin/ml/src/test/java/org/elasticsearch/xpack/ml/integration/MlDistributedFailureIT.java\n    \n    \n         Line 215\n      in\n      071b60d\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n        \n          \n           waitForDatafeed(jobId, numDocs1); \n        \n    \n  \n\n\nwaitForDatafeed waits for the data counts to be indexed which the datafeed does asynchronously before flushing the job. It is amazing that the race between the writing the datacounts and calling flush is sometimes lost to a thread doing an assertBusy searching the index for the new datacounts and then failing the job but that is whats happening here. This is so unlikely (the first time its been reported) it's not worth rewriting the test.", "author": "davidkyle", "createdAt": "2020-02-21T17:24:29Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4MjU0MTgyOA=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "08ec002b705363cb5c76d34887d9c23a7ff5dcef", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/08ec002b705363cb5c76d34887d9c23a7ff5dcef", "message": "Handle case where datafeed has stopped", "committedDate": "2020-02-24T10:56:43Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "f61e53e1948e889fec48d90279ecdf7e4868519f", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/f61e53e1948e889fec48d90279ecdf7e4868519f", "message": "assume false", "committedDate": "2020-02-24T10:56:43Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "f61e53e1948e889fec48d90279ecdf7e4868519f", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/f61e53e1948e889fec48d90279ecdf7e4868519f", "message": "assume false", "committedDate": "2020-02-24T10:56:43Z", "type": "forcePushed"}]}
