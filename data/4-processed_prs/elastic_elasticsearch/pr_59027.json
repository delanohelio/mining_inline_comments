Currently this can result in attempts\nto search the newly created index before its shards have initialized.\n\nThis change makes the method that creates the internal ML indices\nthat have been affected by this problem (state and stats) wait for\nthe shards to be initialized before returning.\n\nFixes #54887\nFixes #55221\nFixes #55807\nFixes #57102\nFixes #58841\nFixes #59011",
