If users have used the http subcommand, they have copied the files already ( as suggested in previous step ) , if not, they have their keys and certificates ready at hand. We can still use http.p12 for consistency here and also use node1_http.key and node1_http.crt in the PEM example to denote that these are usually different than the ones used for transport TLS.
