For starters, we will use the\n-<<ilm-put-lifecycle,Put Policy>> API to define our first policy. Lifecycle\n-policies are defined in JSON and include specific\n-<<ilm-policy-definition,phases and actions>>.\n+A lifecycle policy specifies the phases in the index lifecycle\n+and the actions to perform in each phase. A lifecycle can have up to four  phases:\n+`hot`, `warm`, `cold`, and `delete`. Policies are defined in JSON \n+and added through the {ilm-init} Put policy API. \n+\n+For example, the following request creates a `data_stream` policy with two phases:\n+ \n+* The `hot` phase defines a `rollover` action to specify that an index rolls over when it \n+reaches either a `max_size` of 50 gigabytes or a `max_age` of 30 days.\n+* The `delete` phase uses `min_age` to remove the index 90 days after rollover.\n+Note that this value is relative to the rollover time, not the index creation time. \n \n [source,console]\n ------------------------\n-PUT _ilm/policy/datastream_policy   <1>\n+PUT _ilm/policy/datastream_policy \n {\n-  \"policy\": {                       <2>\n+  \"policy\": {                       \n     \"phases\": {\n-      \"hot\": {                      <3>\n+      \"hot\": {                      <1>\n         \"actions\": {\n-          \"rollover\": {             <4>\n-            \"max_size\": \"50GB\",\n+          \"rollover\": {             \n+            \"max_size\": \"50GB\",     <2>\n             \"max_age\": \"30d\"\n           }\n         }\n       },\n       \"delete\": {\n-        \"min_age\": \"90d\",           <5>\n+        \"min_age\": \"90d\",           <3>\n         \"actions\": {\n-          \"delete\": {}              <6>\n+          \"delete\": {}              <4>\n         }\n       }\n     }\n   }\n }\n ------------------------\n+<1> The `min_age` defaults to `0ms`, so new indices enter the hot phase immediately. \n+<2> Trigger the `rollover` action when either of the conditions are met.\n+<3> Move the index into the delete phase 90 days after rollover.\n+<4> Trigger the `delete` action when the index enters the delete phase.\n \n-<1> call to the <<ilm-put-lifecycle,put lifecycle API>> endpoint to create\n-    a new policy named \"datastream_policy\"\n-<2> policy definition sub-object\n-<3> the hot phase defined in the \"phases\" section.

We are using the <<ilm-rollover-action, Rollover Action>> in our policy, which\n-requires that our index name ends with a number. In our case, we used\n-`000001`. This is important so that Rollover can increment this number when\n-naming the new index created from rolling over.\n-\n-Our index creation request leverages its template to apply our settings,\n-but we must also configure our rollover alias: \"datastream\". To do this,\n-we take advantage of <<aliases-write-index,write indices>>. This is a way\n-to define an alias to be used for both reading and writing, with only one\n-index being the index that is being written to at a time. Rollover swaps\n-the write index to be the new index created from rollover, and sets the\n-alias to be read-only for the source index.\n+When the rollover conditions are met, the rollover action:\n+\n+* Creates a new index called `datastream-000002`. \n+This matches the `datastream-*` pattern, so the settings from `datastream_template` are applied to the new index.\n+* Designates the new index as the write index and makes the bootstrap index read-only.\n+\n+This process will repeat each time the rollover conditions are met. \n+You can search across all of the indices managed by the `datastream_policy` with the `datastream` alias. \n+Write operations are routed to the current write index. \n+\n+For more information about write indices and rollover, see the <<rollover-index-api-desc, Rollover API>>.\n \n [float]\n [[ilm-gs-check-progress]]\n === Checking progress\n \n-Now that we have an index managed by our policy, how do we tell what is going\n-on? Which phase are we in? Is something broken? This section will go over a\n-few APIs and their responses to help us inspect our indices with respect\n-to {ilm-init}.\n+To get status information for {ilm-init}-managed indices, you use the Explain API.
