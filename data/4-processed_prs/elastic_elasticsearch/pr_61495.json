Logic by Pooling Resources (#61358)\n\nThis is mostly motivated by the performance issues we are seeing around the GET mappings\nREST API which (in case of a large number of indices) will create decompressing streams in a hot loop\nwhich takes a significant amount of time for the system calls involved in instantiating deflaters\nand inflaters.\nAlso, this fixes a leaked deflater when deserializing cached repository data.", "committedDate": "2020-08-24T16:21:13Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "3ae4b5c3e547452cd947d1dfca6e3e877e77b216", "url":
