Tests like `MlDistributedFailureIT` and\n`NetworkDisruptionIT`. However, it is unfortunate to have to set the value\nto an explicit value in production. In addition, and most important, the dynamically\nchoosing the value for this setting makes it impossible to adopt static index template configs\nthat we register via `IndexTemplateRegistry`, which we need to use in order to start\nregistering ILM policies for the ML indices.\n\nThis commit removes this setting from our templates. I run the tests a few times and could\nnot see execution time differing significantly.", "committedDate": "2020-01-31T13:18:03Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "e5034044539d3961076b7614a9d3664e72d847a4", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/e5034044539d3961076b7614a9d3664e72d847a4", "message": "Set delayed timeout to relevant tests", "committedDate": "2020-01-31T14:17:24Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3MzUxNzIyNQ==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/51740#discussion_r373517225", "bodyText": "Since both classes where this has been added extend BaseMlIntegTestCase it's probably worth putting this code in a utility method in that base class.\nI also wonder if NetworkDisruptionIT might need it, depending on which random form of network disruption is chosen.
