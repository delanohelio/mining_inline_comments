The\n+ * master node sets up these shard allocations in the cluster state (see {@link org.elasticsearch.cluster.routing.ShardRouting}).\n+ * If a data node finds shard allocations that require recovery on itself, it will execute the required recoveries by executing the\n+ * logic starting at {@link org.elasticsearch.indices.cluster.IndicesClusterStateService#createOrUpdateShards}. As the data nodes execute\n+ * the steps of the recovery state machine they report back success or failure to do so to the master node via the transport actions in\n+ * {@link org.elasticsearch.cluster.action.shard.ShardStateAction}, which will then update the shard routing in the cluster state\n+ * accordingly to reflect the status of the recovered shards or to handle failures in the recovery process. Recoveries can have various\n+ * kinds of sources that are modeled via the {@link org.elasticsearch.cluster.routing.RecoverySource} that is communicated to the recovery\n+ * target by {@link org.elasticsearch.cluster.routing.ShardRouting#recoverySource()} for each shard routing. These sources and their state\n+ * machines will be described below. The actual recovery process for all of them is started by invoking\n+ * {@link org.elasticsearch.index.shard.IndexShard#startRecovery}.\n+ *\n+ * <h3>Checkpoints</h3>\n+ *\n+ * Aspects of the recovery logic are based on the concepts of local and global checkpoints. Each operation on a shard is tracked by a\n+ * sequence number as well as the primary term during which it was applied to the index. The sequence number up to which operations have\n+ * been fully processed on a shard is that shard's local checkpoint. The sequence number up to which operations on all replicas for a shard\n+ * have been fully processed is referred to as the global checkpoint. Comparing the local checkpoints of shard copies enables determining\n+ * which operations would have to be replayed to a shard copy to bring it in-sync with the primary shard. By retaining operations in the\n+ * {@link org.elasticsearch.indices.recovery.RecoveryState.Translog} or in soft deletes, they are available for this kind of replay that\n+ * moves a shard lower local checkpoint up to a higher local checkpoint. The global checkpoint allows for determining which operations have\n+ * been safely processed on all shards and thus don't have to be retained on the primary node for replay to replicas.\n+ *\n+ * The primary node tracks the global checkpoint for a shard via the {@link org.elasticsearch.index.seqno.ReplicationTracker}. The primary\n+ * term is tracked by the master node and stored in the cluster state and incremented each time the primary node for a shard changes.\n+ *\n+ * <h3>Retention Leases</h3>\n+ *\n+ * The duration for which a shard retains individual operations for replay during recovery is governed by the\n+ * {@link org.elasticsearch.index.seqno.RetentionLease} functionality.

Peer Recovery</h3>\n+ *\n+ * Peer recovery is the process of bringing a shard copy on one node, referred to as the target node below, in-sync with the shard copy on\n+ * another node, referred to as the source node below. It is always the primary node of a shard that serves as the source of the recovery.\n+ * On a high level, recovery happens by a combination of comparing and subsequently synchronizing files and operations from the target to\n+ * the source.\n+ * Synchronizing the on-disk file structure on the target with those on the source node is referred to as file-based recovery.\n+ * Synchronizing operations based on comparing checkpoints is commonly referred to as ops-based recovery. As primaries and replicas are\n+ * independent Lucene indices that will execute their Lucene level merges independently the concrete on-disk file structure on a pair of\n+ * primary and replica nodes for a given shard will diverge over time even if both copies of the shard hold the exact same set of documents\n+ * and operations. Peer recovery will therefore try to avoid file-based recovery where possible to reduce the amount of data that has to be\n+ * transferred. It will prefer replaying just those operations missing on the target relative to the source instead as this\n+ * avoids copying files from source to target that could contain data that is for the most part already present on the target.\n+ * Replaying operations is possible as long as the primary node retains the missing operations in its", "originalCommit": "066a5c64a8a02abbf7f06cd716d7829e5489d0e9", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "7a9ea984e844af6957ab58183eb3e8412a3b093c", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/7a9ea984e844af6957ab58183eb3e8412a3b093c", "message": "Merge remote-tracking branch 'elastic/master' into doc-peer-recovery", "committedDate": "2020-11-16T09:06:00Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "b9de73c0bb5ede93a0172bee2c1df32075ccc7ed", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/b9de73c0bb5ede93a0172bee2c1df32075ccc7ed", "message": "CR: comments", "committedDate": "2020-11-16T09:20:14Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "bdb150861d79b2e2995994683634cc4baff6be38", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/bdb150861d79b2e2995994683634cc4baff6be38", "message": "Merge remote-tracking branch 'elastic/master' into doc-peer-recovery", "committedDate": "2020-11-17T12:55:21Z", "type": "commit"}]}
