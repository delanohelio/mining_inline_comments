The correct\nfield is `username`.\n\nThis change adds DEBUG logging when an undefined field is referenced.\n\nThe choice to use DEBUG rather than INFO/WARN is that the set of\nfields is partially dynamic (e.g. the `metadata.*` fields), so\nit may be perfectly reasonable to check a field that is not defined\nfor that user. For example this rule:\n\n    \"rules\": { \"field\": { \"metadata.ranking\" : \"A\" } }\n\nwould generate a log message for an unranked user, which would\nerroneously suggest that such a rule is an error.\nThis DEBUG logging will assist in diagnosing problems, without\nintroducing that confusion.", "committedDate": "2020-08-18T04:20:02Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ3Mjc3OTM2MQ==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/61246#discussion_r472779361", "bodyText": "This string format will not be very useful if the value is an array.
