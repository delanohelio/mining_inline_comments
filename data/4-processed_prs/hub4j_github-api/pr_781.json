Yes, the creation of the reader and adding of injected values happens there.\nOther than the value injection for GitHub and ResponseInfo, binding happens just like it usually does.\nThe point of this change is that the setter methods for Jackson properties do not need to be public. Jackson can access internal or private setters, and will even automatically bind fields that do not have setters or constructor paramters (regardless of access limitations).
