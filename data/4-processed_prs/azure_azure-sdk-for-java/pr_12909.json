Please look for packages that contains \"azure-resourcemanager\" in the namespace.\n+\n+## General Changes\n+\n+The latest Azure Java SDK for management libraries is a result of our efforts to create a resource management client library that is user-friendly and idiomatic to the Java ecosystem.\n+\n+Apart from redesigns resulting from the [new Azure SDK Design Guidelines for Java](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/master/sdk/management/docs/DESIGN.md), the latest version improves on several areas from old version.\n+\n+While conforming to the new guideline, we have tried our best to minimize the breaking changes. Most of the interfaces / classes / methods have stayed the same to offer user an easier migration experience.\n+\n+The important breaking changes are listed in the following sections:\n+\n+### Authentication\n+\n+In old version (`com.microsoft.azure.management.**`), ApplicationTokenCredentials is created with all the credential parameters.\n+\n+In new version (`com.azure.resourcemanager.**`), in order to provide an unified authentication based on Azure Identity for all Azure Java SDKs, the authentication mechanism has been re-designed and improved to offer a simpler interface. \n+\n+To the show the code snippets for the change:\n+\n+**In old version (`com.microsoft.azure.management.**`)**\n+\n+```java\n+ApplicationTokenCredential = new ApplicationTokenCredentials(\"<ClientId>\", \"<TenantId>\", \"<ClientSecret>\", AzureEnvironment.AZURE)\n+    .withDefaultSubscriptionId(\"<SubscriptionId>\");\n+```        \n+\n+**Equivalent in new version (`com.azure.resourcemanager.**`)**\n+\n+```java\n+TokenCredential credential = new ClientSecretCredentialBuilder()\n+    .clientId(\"<ClientId>\")\n+    .clientSecret(\"<ClientSecret>\")\n+    .tenantId(\"<TenantId>\")\n+    .build();\n+AzureProfile profile = new AzureProfile(\"<TenantId>\", \"<SubscriptionId>\", AzureEnvironment.AZURE);\n+``` \n+\n+In addition to this change, the **support for using auth file has been removed**. In old version, the user can choose to authenticate via the auth file, like this:\n+\n+**In old version (`com.microsoft.azure.management.**`)**\n+\n+```java\n+Azure azure = Azure.authenticate(new File(\"my.azureauth\")).withDefaultSubscription();\n+```\n+**In new version, this feature has been removed.** If this creates concern on your side, please file an issue to let us know.\n+\n+For detailed information on the benefits of using the new authentication classes, please refer to [this page](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/master/sdk/management/docs/AUTH.md)\n+\n+## Customized Policy\n+\n+Because of adopting Azure Core which is a shared library across all Azure SDKs, there is also a minor change regarding how customized policy in configured. \n+\n+In old version (`com.microsoft.azure.management.**`), we use `withInterceptor` and pass the customized interceptor class to the Azure object \n+\n+In new version (`com.azure.resourcemanager.**`), we use `WithPolicy` instead and pass the customized policy to the Azure object. It's also worth mentioning that the implementation of `HttpPipelinePolicy` is different from that of `Interceptor` from okhttp. \n+\n+So:\n+\n+**In old version (`com.microsoft.azure.management.**`)**\n+\n+```java\n+Azure azure = Azure.configure()\n+    .withInterceptor(new CustomizedInterceptor())\n+    .authenticate(credential)\n+    .withDefaultSubscription();\n+```\n+\n+**Equivalent in new version (`com.azure.resourcemanager.**`)**\n+\n+```java\n+Azure azure = Azure.configure()\n+    .withPolicy(new CustomizedPolicy())\n+    .authenticate(credential, profile)\n+    .withDefaultSubscription();\n+```\n+\n+## Custom HTTP Client\n+\n+Similar to the customized policy, there are changes regarding how the custom HTTP client is configured as well. The re-designed HTTP client builder in the new version is more flexible and the user can choose their own implementation of HTTP client and plug in what they need into the configuration.\n+\n+**In old version (`com.microsoft.azure.management.**`)**\n+\n+```java\n+OkHttpClient.Builder builder = new OkHttpClient.Builder().proxy(new Proxy(Proxy.Type.HTTP, new InetSocketAddress(\"127.0.0.1\", 8888)));\n+RestClient client = new RestClient.Builder(builder, new Retrofit.Builder())\n+    .withCredentials(credential)\n+    .build();\n+\n+Azure azure = Azure.authenticate(client, \"<TenantId>\")\n+    .withDefaultSubscription();\n+```\n+\n+**Equivalent in new version (`com.azure.resourcemanager.**`)**\n+\n+```java\n+HttpClient client = new OkHttpAsyncHttpClientBuilder()\n+    .proxy(new ProxyOptions(ProxyOptions.Type.HTTP, new InetSocketAddress(\"127.0.0.1\", 8888)))\n+    .build();\n+\n+Azure azure = Azure.configure()\n+    .withHttpClient(client)\n+    .authenticate(credential, profile)\n+    .withDefaultSubscription();\n+```    \n+    \n+## Error Handling\n+\n+There is a minor namespace change in the exception class.
