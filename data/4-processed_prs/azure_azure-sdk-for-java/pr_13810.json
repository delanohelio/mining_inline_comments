Internally, Key Vault stores and manages secrets as sequences of octets (8-bit bytes), with a maximum size of 25k bytes each. The Key Vault service doesn't provide semantics for secrets. It merely accepts the data, encrypts it, stores it, and returns a secret identifier (\"id\"). The identifier can be used to retrieve the secret at a later time.\n+\n+For highly sensitive data, clients should consider additional layers of protection for data. Encrypting data using a separate protection key prior to storage in Key Vault is one example.\n+\n+Key Vault also supports a contentType field for secrets. Clients may specify the content type of a secret to assist in interpreting the secret data when it's retrieved. The maximum length of this field is 255 characters. There are no pre-defined values. The suggested usage is as a hint for interpreting the secret data. For instance, an implementation may store both passwords and certificates as secrets, then use this field to differentiate. There are no predefined values.\n+\n+## Examples", "originalCommit": "eaf950bde07ed4030b72e9dd48c1592a4f43c13c", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2NTcyNTc1OQ==", "url": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/13810#discussion_r465725759", "bodyText": "Same here.", "author": "saragluna", "createdAt": "2020-08-05T13:27:48Z", "path": "sdk/spring/azure-spring-boot-starter-metrics/README.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -49,17 +54,24 @@ To solve this issue, you need to add the dependency below into your classpath:\n    <version>2.3.0</version>\n </dependency>\n ```\n+### Enable client logging\n+Azure SDKs for Java offer a consistent logging story to help aid in troubleshooting application errors and expedite their resolution.
