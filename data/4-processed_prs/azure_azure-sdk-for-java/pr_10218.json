The output of models trained with and without labels\n+differs as described below.\n+\n+#### Using models trained without labels\n+Models trained without labels consider each form page to be a different form type. For example, if you train your\n+model on 3-page forms, it will learn that these are three different types of forms.

For example, if you train your model on 3-page forms\n+with labels, it will learn to recognize field values from the locations you've labeled across all pages in the form.\n+If you sent a document containing two forms to it for analysis, it would return a collection of two forms,\n+where each form contains the field names, values, and locations, as well as table data, found in that form.\n+Fields and tables have page numbers to identify the pages where they were found.\n+\n+### Managing Custom Models\n+Using the `FormTrainingClient`, you can get, list, and delete the custom models you've trained.\n+You can also view the count of models you've trained and the maximum number of models your subscription will\n+allow you to store.\n \n ## Examples\n-The following sections provide several code snippets covering some of the most common Form Recognizer tasks, including:\n \n-### Form Recognizer Client\n-Form Recognizer support both synchronous and asynchronous client creation by using\n-`FormRecognizerClientBuilder`,\n+The following section provides several code snippets covering some of the most common Form Recognizer tasks, including:\n \n-<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/ai/formrecognizer/ReadmeSamples.java#L39-L42 -->\n-``` java\n-FormRecognizerClient formRecognizerClient = new FormRecognizerClientBuilder()\n-    .apiKey(new AzureKeyCredential(\"{api_key}\"))\n-    .endpoint(\"{endpoint}\")\n-    .buildClient();\n-```\n-<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/ai/formrecognizer/ReadmeSamples.java#L49-L52 -->\n-``` java\n-FormRecognizerAsyncClient formRecognizerAsyncClient = new FormRecognizerClientBuilder()\n-    .apiKey(new AzureKeyCredential(\"{api_key}\"))\n-    .endpoint(\"{endpoint}\")\n-    .buildAsyncClient();\n-```\n+* [Recognize Receipts](#recognize-receipts \"Recognize receipts\")\n+* [Recognize Content](#recognize-content \"Recognize Content\")\n+* [Recognize Forms Using a Custom Model](#recognize-forms-using-a-custom-model \"Recognize Forms Using a Custom Model\")\n+* [Train a Model](#train-a-model \"Train a model\")\n+* [Manage Your Models](#manage-your-models \"Manage Your Models\")\n \n ### Extract receipt information", "originalCommit": "12159894917fd767ea2353777ef71cd415892dd2", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQxMDI5NzI4Mg==", "url": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/10218#discussion_r410297282", "bodyText": "I think it'd be best to have the forms also in the samples folder, doesn't look great going into the test folder", "author": "iscai-msft", "createdAt": "2020-04-17T15:26:11Z", "path": "sdk/formrecognizer/azure-ai-formrecognizer/src/samples/java/com/azure/ai/formrecognizer/AdvancedDiffLabeledUnlabeledData.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,74 @@\n+// Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.

It provides both synchronous and\n-asynchronous operations to access a specific use of Form Recognizer, such as training custom models,\n-extracting layout and receipt information from documents.\n+### FormRecognizerClient\n+The [FormRecognizerClient][form_recognizer_sync_client] and [FormRecognizerAsyncClient][form_recognizer_async_client]\n+provide both synchronous and asynchronous operations to recognize data from forms using custom trained models, \n+recognizing content from forms, and analyzing receipts.\n+\n+### FormTrainingClient\n+The [FormTrainingClient][form_training_sync_client] and \n+[FormTrainingAsyncClient][form_training_async_client] provide both synchronous and asynchronous operations for \n+for training custom models, retrieving and deleting models, as well as understanding how close you are to \n+reaching subscription limits for the number of models you can train.\n+\n+### Long-Running Operations\n+Long-running operations are operations which consist of an initial request sent to the service to start an operation,\n+followed by polling the service at intervals to determine whether the operation has completed or failed, and if it has\n+succeeded, to get the result.\n+\n+Methods that train models or recognize values from forms are modeled as long-running operations. The client exposes\n+a `begin<method-name>` method that returns a `SyncPoller` or `PollerFlux` instance. \n+Callers should wait for the operation to completed by calling `getFinalResult()` on the returned operation from the\n+`begin<method-name>` method. Sample code snippets are provided to illustrate using long-running operations\n+[below](#Examples).\n+\n+### Training models\n+Using the `FormTrainingClient`, you can train a machine-learned model on your own form type. The resulting model will\n+be able to recognize values from the types of forms it was trained on.\n+You have the following options when you train custom models: [training with labeled data][service_doc_train_labeled]\n+and [train without labeled data][service_doc_train_labeled].\n+\n+### Recognizing values from forms\n+Using the `FormRecognizerClient`, you can use your own trained models to recognize field values and locations, as well as\n+table data, from forms of the type you trained your models on. The output of models trained with and without labels\n+differs as shown in this [sample][differentiate_custom_forms_with_labeled_and_unlabeled_models].\n+\n+### Managing Custom Models\n+Using the `FormTrainingClient`, you can get, list, and delete the custom models you've trained.\n+You can also view the count of models you've trained and the maximum number of models your subscription will\n+allow you to store.\n \n ## Examples\n-The following sections provide several code snippets covering some of the most common Form Recognizer tasks, including:\n \n-### Form Recognizer Client\n-Form Recognizer support both synchronous and asynchronous client creation by using\n-`FormRecognizerClientBuilder`,\n+The following section provides several code snippets covering some of the most common Form Recognizer tasks, including:\n \n-<!-- embedme ./src/samples/java/com/azure/ai/formrecognizer/ReadmeSamples.java#L39-L42 -->\n-``` java\n-FormRecognizerClient formRecognizerClient = new FormRecognizerClientBuilder()\n-    .apiKey(new AzureKeyCredential(\"{api_key}\"))\n-    .endpoint(\"{endpoint}\")\n-    .buildClient();\n+* [Recognize Forms Using a Custom Model](#recognize-forms-using-a-custom-model \"Recognize Forms Using a Custom Model\")\n+* [Recognize Content](#recognize-content \"Recognize Content\")\n+* [Recognize Receipts](#recognize-receipts \"Recognize receipts\")\n+* [Train a Model](#train-a-model \"Train a model\")\n+* [Manage Your Models](#manage-your-models \"Manage Your Models\")\n+\n+\n+### Recognize Forms Using a Custom Model\n+Recognize name/value pairs and table data from forms.
