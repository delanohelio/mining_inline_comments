The T that we accept as input isn't being used anywhere in the request (all classes are objects, so we pass it in as-is).

If not, then we will serialize it before sending it on the wire.\nAs for accepting T vs Object, since the T class info is unused in the request, it made more sense to me to have it as an object.

If the input parameter is T, and you set T to be BasicDigitalTwin, then you cannot pass in a json string. You'll get a compilation error since the json string is not of type BasicDigitalTwin.\n\nAs for accepting T vs Object, since the T class info is unused in the request, it made more sense to me to have it as an object.\n\nI understand that we don't need the parameter to be of type T, but I don't want customers using this API in ways where the return type and passed in type are different. That sounds like a promise that we won't be able to keep given how generic Object is. I'd rather keep it simple and restful and force the users to give and receive the same type here.\n\n... but now the public API is stating a contract that for you to be able to inspect a response as a BasicDigitalTwin, you need to pass in your input as a BasicDigitalTwin -> even though this is not a requirement.\n\nI think this is a good expectation to place on the user, though.
