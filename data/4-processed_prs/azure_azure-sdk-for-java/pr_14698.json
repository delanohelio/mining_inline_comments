Tables don't enforce a schema on entities, which means a single table can contain entities that have different sets of properties.\n+- **Entity** - An entity is a set of properties, similar to a database row. An entity in Azure Storage can be up to 1MB in size. An entity in Azure Cosmos DB can be up to 2MB in size. An entity has a partition key and a row key which together uniquely identify the entity within the table.\n+- **Properties** - A property is a name-value pair. Each entity can include up to 252 properties to store data. Each entity also has three system properties that specify a partition key, a row key, and a timestamp.\n+- **Partition Key** - An entity's partition key identifies the partition within the table to which the entity belongs. Entities with the same partition key can be queried more quickly, and inserted/updated in atomic operations.\n+- **Row Key** - An entity's row key is its unique identifier within a partition.\n+\n+Common uses of the Table service include:\n+\n+- Storing TBs of structured data capable of serving web scale applications\n+- Storing datasets that don't require complex joins, foreign keys, or stored procedures and can be de-normalized for fast access\n+- Quickly querying data using a clustered index\n+- Accessing data using the OData protocol\n+\n ## Examples\n-Use the client library for Tables to:\n-- manages tables\n-- edit and access table contents\n+\n+- [Authenticate a client](#authenticate-a-client)\n+  - [Authenticate with a connection string](#authenticate-with-a-connection-string)\n+  - [Authenticate with a Shared Key](#authenticate-with-a-shared-key)\n+  - [Authenticate with a Shared Access Signature (SAS)](#authenticate-with-a-shared-access-signature-sas)\n+- [Create, List, and Delete Azure tables](#create-list-and-delete-azure-tables)\n+  - [Construct a `TableServiceClient`](#construct-a-tableserviceclient)\n+  - [Create a table](#create-a-table)\n+  - [List tables](#list-tables)\n+  - [Delete a table](#delete-a-table)\n+- [Create, List, and Delete table entities](##create-list-and-delete-table-entities)\n+  - [Construct a `TableClient`](#construct-a-tableclient)\n+  - [Create an entity](#create-an-entity)\n+  - [List entities](#list-entities)\n+  - [Delete an entity](#delete-an-entity)\n+\n+### Authenticate a client\n+\n+#### Authenticate with a connection string\n+To use a connection string to authorize your client, call the builder's `connectionString` method with your connection string.\n+\n+```java\n+TableServiceClient tableServiceClient = new TableServiceClientBuilder()\n+    .connectionString(\"<your-connection-string>\")\n+    .buildClient();\n+```\n+\n+#### Authenticate with a Shared Key\n+To use a Shared Key to authorize your client, create an instance of `TablesSharedKeyCredential` with your account name and access key.

It relies on your account access keys and other parameters to produce an encrypted signature string that is passed on the request in the query string. See [Authenticate with a Shared Access Signature (SAS) token](#authenticate-with-a-shared-access-signature-sas-token) for an example of how to use shared access signatures with a `TableServiceClient`.\n+\n+To use SAS token authorization you'll need your account name and URL, as well as the SAS. You can obtain your SAS from the Azure Portal (click **Shared access signature** under **Settings** in the Portal Storage account blade) or using the Azure CLI:\n+\n+```bash\n+# Account-level SAS\n+az storage account generate-sas \\\n+    --account-name <storage-or-cosmosdb-account-name> \\\n+    --services t \\\n+    --resource-types <resource-types> \\\n+    --permissions <permissions> \\\n+    --expiry <expiry-date>\n+\n+# Table-level SAS\n+az storage table generate-sas \\\n+    --name <table-name>\n+```\n+\n ## Key concepts\n \n+- **TableServiceClient** - A `TableServiceClient` is a client object that enables you to interact with the Table Service in order to create, list, and delete tables.\n+- **TableClient** - A `TableClient` is a client object that enables you to interact with a specific table in order to create, update, list, and delete entities within it.\n+- **Table** - A table is a collection of entities. Tables don't enforce a schema on entities, which means a single table can contain entities that have different sets of properties.\n+- **Entity** - An entity is a set of properties, similar to a database row. An entity in Azure Storage can be up to 1MB in size. An entity in Azure Cosmos DB can be up to 2MB in size. An entity has a partition key and a row key which together uniquely identify the entity within the table.\n+- **Properties** - A property is a name-value pair. Each entity can include up to 252 properties to store data. Each entity also has three system properties that specify a partition key, a row key, and a timestamp.\n+- **Partition Key** - An entity's partition key identifies the partition within the table to which the entity belongs. Entities with the same partition key can be queried more quickly, and inserted/updated in atomic operations.\n+- **Row Key** - An entity's row key is its unique identifier within a partition.\n+\n+Common uses of the Table service include:\n+\n+- Storing TBs of structured data capable of serving web scale applications\n+- Storing datasets that don't require complex joins, foreign keys, or stored procedures and can be de-normalized for fast access\n+- Quickly querying data using a clustered index\n+- Accessing data using the OData protocol\n+\n ## Examples\n-Use the client library for Tables to:\n-- manages tables\n-- edit and access table contents\n+\n+- [Authenticate a client](#authenticate-a-client)\n+  - [Authenticate with a connection string](#authenticate-with-a-connection-string)\n+  - [Authenticate with a Shared Key](#authenticate-with-a-shared-key)\n+  - [Authenticate with a Shared Access Signature (SAS)](#authenticate-with-a-shared-access-signature-sas)\n+- [Create, List, and Delete Azure tables](#create-list-and-delete-azure-tables)\n+  - [Construct a `TableServiceClient`](#construct-a-tableserviceclient)\n+  - [Create a table](#create-a-table)\n+  - [List tables](#list-tables)\n+  - [Delete a table](#delete-a-table)\n+- [Create, List, and Delete table entities](##create-list-and-delete-table-entities)\n+  - [Construct a `TableClient`](#construct-a-tableclient)\n+  - [Create an entity](#create-an-entity)\n+  - [List entities](#list-entities)\n+  - [Delete an entity](#delete-an-entity)\n+\n+### Authenticate a client\n+\n+#### Authenticate with a connection string\n+To use a connection string to authorize your client, call the builder's `connectionString` method with your connection string.\n+\n+```java", "originalCommit": "681b140cd1fab637aa562b4d0878fe1d2b186f68", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4MzIyOTIxMQ==", "url": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/14698#discussion_r483229211", "bodyText": "Working on this now. @srnagar how do I embed code snippets that are just a single line or use example variables (e.g. those that aren't a complete, compilable sample?)
