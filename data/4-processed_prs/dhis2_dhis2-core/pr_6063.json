I see this PR more like a temporary fix: we discovered several design \"issues\" in the new Tracker with @stian-sandvold  and one of those is definitively the way Users are handled. Currently, without this PR, the new Tracker doesn't work AT ALL, so this is more a fix to allow the testing to proceed while we try to redesign some of the internals.
