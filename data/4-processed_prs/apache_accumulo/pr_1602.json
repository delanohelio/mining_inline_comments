The original code specified the constructor was the one that took a String explicitly. This code would work if the type was changed to URI, instead of String, but I'm not sure the behavior would be identical. The original version protects against subtle differences like that. For this reason, I'm not a big fan of method references for constructors, unless the type is very stable and well-known (like ArrayList::new).\nThe change you've made here is probably fine... but I'm not sure if we want to protect against possible subtle changes in this code by keeping the explicit String type declaration.", "author": "ctubbsii", "createdAt": "2020-04-29T00:32:57Z", "path": "server/base/src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/server/fs/VolumeManagerImpl.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -353,7 +353,7 @@ public Path matchingFileSystem(Path source, Set<String> options) {\n       URI optUri = URI.create(opt);\n       return sourceUri.getScheme().equals(optUri.getScheme())\n           && Objects.equals(sourceUri.getAuthority(), optUri.getAuthority());\n-    }).map((String opt) -> new Path(opt)).findFirst().orElse(null);\n+    }).map(Path::new).findFirst().orElse(null);", "originalCommit": "d77a5e2f02512058437c7d95e914e76a62a61918", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQxNzI3NzgzNw==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1602#discussion_r417277837", "bodyText": "@ctubbsii I reverted this particular change based upon your suggestion.
