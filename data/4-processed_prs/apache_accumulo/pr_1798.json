We could make the salt configurable or based on instance.secret, but there's no additional security added by doing so, since instance.secret is configurable and is already included in the message digest. So, a fixed salt would suffice here. If you're not interested in pursuing this, here, it can be done as a follow-on issue. Just let me know if that's the case, so I can create a new issue for it.\nAs you've identified, the one benefit to making it configurable and preserving the current one is to support rolling restart. However, we don't support rolling restarts very well already, and certainly not across major or minor releases, and we've likely already broken compatibility of that sort during 2.1's development (or will, if we upgrade Thrift).
