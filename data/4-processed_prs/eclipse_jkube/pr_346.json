It's an actual virtual virtual machine running Linux where Docker is hosted. Then the Docker daemon host is shared with windows environment. (Maybe check this (translated) article I wrote way back in 2015 so you understand what this is).\nThis sort of workaround is/was needed because Windows has no Linux Kernel and obviously Docker can't access to underlying cgroups or namespaces. So as a workaround, Docker runs on a VM and the daemon is shared with Windows. Similar to what happens eval $(minikube docker-env) if you may.\nYou are probably referring to Docker Swarm when talking about some sort of replacement for Kubernetes, right?", "author": "manusa", "createdAt": "2020-08-06T05:46:16Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2NjE1MDQxMw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2NjE2Mjc0Nw==", "url": "https://github.com/eclipse/jkube/pull/346#discussion_r466162747", "bodyText": "I got this from this article: https://stackshare.io/stackups/docker-machine-vs-kubernetes", "author": "rohanKanojia", "createdAt": "2020-08-06T05:55:23Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2NjE1MDQxMw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2NjE2NDExMw==", "url": "https://github.com/eclipse/jkube/pull/346#discussion_r466164113", "bodyText": "ohk, let me add it back.", "author": "rohanKanojia", "createdAt": "2020-08-06T05:59:52Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2NjE1MDQxMw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2NjE2NjI3MQ==", "url": "https://github.com/eclipse/jkube/pull/346#discussion_r466166271", "bodyText": "I can't see any article, it's just a comparison tool.
