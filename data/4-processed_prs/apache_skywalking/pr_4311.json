Users may wants to upgrade to an old release to new.\n+This is a guidance to tell users how to do that.\n+\n+**NOTICE**, the following ways are not the only ways to do upgrade.\n+\n+## Use Canary Release\n+Like all applications, SkyWalking could use `canary release` method to upgrade by following these steps\n+1. Deploy a new cluster by using the latest(or new) version of SkyWalking OAP cluster with new database cluster.\n+1. Once the target(being monitored) service has chance to upgrade the agent.jar(or just simply reboot), change the `collector.backend_service`\n+pointing to the new OAP backend, and use/add a new namespace(`agent.namespace` in [Table of Agent Configuration Properties](../setup/service-agent/java-agent/README.md#table-of-agent-configuration-properties)).\n+The namespace will avoid the conflict between different versions.\n+1. When all target services have been rebooted, the old OAP clusters could be discarded.\n+\n+`Canary Release` methods works for any version upgrade.\n+\n+## Online Hot Reboot Upgrade\n+The reason we required `Canary Release` is, SkyWalking agent has cache mechanisms, switching to a new cluster makes the \n+cache unavailable for new OAP cluster.\n+In the 6.5.0+(especially for agent version), we have [**Agent hot reboot trigger mechanism**](../setup/backend/backend-setup.md#agent-hot-reboot-trigger-mechanism-in-oap-server-upgrade).\n+By using that, we could do upgrade an easier way, **deploy a new cluster by using the latest(or new) version of SkyWalking OAP cluster with new database cluster**,\n+and shift the traffic to the new cluster once for all. Based on the mechanism, all agents will go into `cool_down` mode, then\n+back online. More detail, read the backend setup document.\n+\n+**NOTICE**, as a known bug in 6.4.0, its agent could have re-connection issue, so, even this bot reboot mechanism included in 6.4.0,\n+it may not work in some network scenarios, especially in k8s.\n+\n+## Agent Compatibility\n+All versions of SkyWalking 6.x(even 7.x) are compatible with each others, so users could not upgrade the agents.
