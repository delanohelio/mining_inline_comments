The \n+SDK may provide an autoconfiguration extension as an option which is not internal to the main SDK \n+components.\n+\n+## Configuring an instance of the SDK\n+\n+The SDK consists of configuration options for all the signals it supports. Users all have different\n+requirements for how they use the SDK, for example they may use different exporters depending on\n+their backend. Because we cannot guess the configuration the user needs, we expect that the SDK must\n+be configured by the user before it can be used.\n+\n+Goals for configuring the SDK are\n+\n+- Discoverability of options\n+- Ease of use by end users, e.g., less complicated code required\n+- Avoid requiring duplicate configuration, which can lead to errors or confusion\n+- Provide good defaults where possible\n+\n+In Java, the builder pattern is common for configuring instances. Let's look at what that may look\n+like. The simplest configuration will be when a user wants to get a default experience, exporting\n+with a specific exporter to an endpoint.\n+\n+```java\n+OpenTelemetrySdk openTelemetry = OpenTelemetrySdk.builder()\n+  .addSpanExporter(OtlpGrpcSpanExporter.builder()\n+    .setEndpoint(\"spans-service:4317\")\n+    .build())\n+  .addMetricExposition(PrometheusExposition.getDefault())\n+  .build();\n+```\n+\n+This\n+\n+- Exports spans using OTLP to spans-service\n+  - Uses the BatchSpanProcessor (or a batching exporter wraper) which we consider the best default \n+  for exporting. It has defaults for queue size, timeout, etc\n+- Exposes metrics using Prometheus format\n+- Uses ParentBased(AlwaysOn) sampler\n+- Uses standard random IDs\n+- Uses a default Resource which simply consists of the SDK (or any other resources we decide to)\n+include in the core SDK, not extensions\n+- Uses the default Clock, which uses Java 8 / 9+ optimized APIs for getting time\n+  - The only real reason a user would set this is for unit tests, not for production\n+- Enforces default numeric limits related to number of attribute, etc\n+\n+Because the exporting is often the only aspect an end user needs to configure, this is the simplest\n+possible API for configuring the SDK.\n+\n+Let's look at a more complicated example\n+\n+```java\n+OpenTelemetrySdk openTelemetry = OpenTelemetrySdk.builder()\n+  .setResource(Resource.getDefault().merge(CoolResource.getDefault()))\n+  .setClock(AtomicClock.create())\n+  .setPropagators(B3Propagator.getInstance())\n+  .addSpanExporter(OtlpGrpcSpanExporter.builder()\n+    .setEndpoint(\"spans-service:4317\")\n+    .setTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(10))\n+    .setBatchQueueSize(10000)\n+    .build())\n+  .addSpanExporter(ZipkinExporter.builder()\n+    .setEndpoint(\"spans-service:4317\")\n+    .disableBatching()\n+    .build())\n+  .addSpanExporter(FullyAsyncZipkinExporter.create())\n+  .addSpanProcessor(CustomAttributeAddingProcessor.create())\n+  .addSpanProcessor(CustomEventAddingProcessor.create())\n+  .setTraceSampler(Sampler.rateLimiting())\n+  .setTraceLimits(TraceLimits.builder().setMaxAttributes(10).build())\n+  .setIdGenerator(TimestampedIdGenerator.create())\n+  .setMeterStuff(InProgressMetricsStuff.create())\n+  .build()\n+```\n+\n+This configures resource, clock, exporters, span processors, sampler, trace limits, and metrics.\n+Everything is exposed on the `OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder` to provide discoverability of all the parts\n+of the SDK and to let the SDK manage shared components - it is not possible to configure a different\n+`Resource` for tracing and metrics, something that would be a gotcha. Exporters are handled natively\n+given they are so important - even though the exporters are specified before span processors, they\n+will always be executed last to make sure all span processors appy to them. The exporter builders\n+inherit from a `ExporterBuilder` type of abstract class - it takes cafe of batching configuration to\n+avoid having to understand separate concepts like `BatchSpanProcessor`. Exporters that don't support\n+batching at all, like the custom `FullyAsyncZipkinExporter` don't have to. Note this can be\n+similarly achieved by having wrappers like `BatchExporter.wrap(OtlpGrpcSpanExporter.builder()...`\n+as well and is presented as one option.\n+\n+Note that parts can be separated to separate subconfig classes if it seems to make the API easier to\n+use. We would want to avoid duplication though, e.g., having two configurations that expect a\n+`Resource`.\n+\n+One thing to keep in mind is that it will be less common for an application developer to go this far\n+and we can expect it is actually framework developers that use the full configuration capabilities\n+of the SDK, likely by tying it to a separate configuration system.\n+\n+### Why build instances\n+\n+We have found that even at such an early stage of user adoption, users want to build instances of\n+the SDK.\n+\n+- Integrates with dependency injection, e.g., Spring, in a similar way as many other libraries\n+- Can allow having multiple instances in the same app, in multi-concern single-classloader scenarios\n+- Allow managing lifecycle of SDK, e.g., shutting down and starting along with the lifecycle of a\n+serverless runtime\n+\n+### Configuring the SDK in a framework\n+\n+It is extremely common for Java apps to be written using a dependency injection framework like\n+Spring, Guice, Dagger, HK, and many more. They will all follow a very similar pattern though.\n+\n+```java\n+@Component\n+public class OpenTelemetryModule {\n+  \n+  @Bean\n+  public OpenTelemetry openTelemetry(MonitoringConfig config) {\n+    OpenTelemetrySdk.builder()\n+      .setResource(Resource.getDefault().merge(CoolResource.getDefault()))\n+      .setClock(AtomicClock.create())\n+      .setPropagators(B3Propagator.getInstance())\n+      .addSpanExporter(OtlpGrpcSpanExporter.builder()\n+        .setEndpoint(config.getOtlpExporter().getEndpoint())\n+        .setTimeout(config.getOtlpExporter().getTimeout())\n+        .setBatchQueueSize(config.getOtlpExporter().getQueueSize())\n+        .build())\n+      .addSpanExporter(ZipkinExporter.builder()\n+        .setEndpoint(config.getZipkinExporter().getEndpoint())\n+        .disableBatching()\n+        .build())\n+      .addSpanExporter(FullyAsyncZipkinExporter.create())\n+      .addSpanProcessor(CustomAttributeAddingProcessor.create())\n+      .addSpanProcessor(CustomEventAddingProcessor.create())\n+      .setTraceSampler(config.getSamplingRate() != 0 \n+          ?

Because it\n+has a easy-to-reason lifecycle, being tied into the dependency ordering (even if dependency \n+injection happened to be done manually through constructor invocation), we encourage application\n+developers to only use it.\n+\n+However, there are corner cases where an instance cannot be injected. The famous example is MySQL -\n+MySQL interceptors are initialized by calling a default constructor, and there is no way to pass a\n+built instance of a signal provider. For this case, we must store an SDK instance into a global\n+variable. To reduce gotchas for application developers, the first SDK that is instantiated is stored\n+automatically in the global variable.\n+\n+Before an SDK has been set, access to the global SDK will throw an exception and will not return a\n+default. The global can only be used after an SDK has been configured. SDKs must be configured early\n+in an application to ensure it applies to all of the logic in the app, and this will generally be\n+ensured by the configuration framework such as Spring. For application developers, this restriction\n+should not have any effect one way or the other in the vast majority of cases.\n+\n+MySQL is the only known corner case that requires the global SDK instance.

It is a\n+continuation of discussion started with https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/issues/2022.\n+\n+## Target audiences\n+\n+There are a few different target audiences that are related to our configuration story.\n+\n+- Application developers, aka end-users. Often have no knowledge of tracing but want to add \n+OpenTelemetry to their app and see traces show up in a console. Application developers will increase\n+in number forever, while the below are more constant.\n+\n+- Dev-ops / framework developers. Write components or frameworks to support providing tracing to\n+their application developers. May write custom SDK extensions such as exporters, samplers, to fit\n+with their internal infrastructure and as such have some familiarity with tracing at least as the\n+SDK presents it.\n+\n+- OpenTelemetry maintainers. Write the SDK code.\n+\n+When making decisions, especially about complexity, we always prioritize the application developers,\n+then framework developers, then maintainers. This is because we expect those with less domain\n+knowledge about tracing to require a simpler experience than those with more. There is also more\n+bang-for-the-buck by making the end-user experience as streamlined as possible since we expect there\n+to be much more of them than other audiences.\n+\n+## Goals and non-goals\n+\n+### Goals\n+\n+- Provide a single entrypoint to configuring the SDK. For end-users, less familiar with the SDK, we\n+want to have everything together to provide discoverability and simpler end-user code.\n+\n+- Fit well with common Java idioms such as dependency injection, or common frameworks like Spring.\n+\n+- Reduce the chance of gotchas or configuration mishaps.\n+\n+- Aim for optimal performance for the most common use case.\n+\n+### Non-goals\n+\n+- Provide the best possible experience for custom SDKs. Generally the burden of the experience for\n+custom SDKs can fall on their authors, we optimize for our standard usage, the full SDK. Any\n+reference to \"the SDK\" in this document refers to the full SDK with all signals.\n+\n+- Make sure everything is auto-configurable. This is out of the scope of the SDK, and instead is\n+left to auto-configuration layers, which are also described below but not as part of the core SDK. \n+In partiular, SignalProvider SPIs which currently exist are proposed to be removed from the SDK. The \n+SDK may provide an autoconfiguration extension as an option which is not internal to the main SDK \n+components.\n+\n+## Configuring an instance of the SDK\n+\n+The SDK consists of configuration options for all the signals it supports. Users all have different\n+requirements for how they use the SDK, for example they may use different exporters depending on\n+their backend. Because we cannot guess the configuration the user needs, we expect that the SDK must\n+be configured by the user before it can be used.\n+\n+Goals for configuring the SDK are\n+\n+- Discoverability of options\n+- Ease of use by end users, e.g., less complicated code required\n+- Avoid requiring duplicate configuration, which can lead to errors or confusion\n+- Provide good defaults where possible\n+\n+In Java, the builder pattern is common for configuring instances. Let's look at what that may look\n+like. The simplest configuration will be when a user wants to get a default experience, exporting\n+with a specific exporter to an endpoint.\n+\n+```java\n+OpenTelemetrySdk openTelemetry = OpenTelemetrySdk.builder()\n+  .addSpanExporter(OtlpGrpcSpanExporter.builder()\n+    .setEndpoint(\"spans-service:4317\")\n+    .build())\n+  .addMetricExposition(PrometheusExposition.getDefault())\n+  .build();\n+```\n+\n+This\n+\n+- Exports spans using OTLP to spans-service\n+  - Uses the BatchSpanProcessor (or a batching exporter wraper) which we consider the best default \n+  for exporting. It has defaults for queue size, timeout, etc\n+- Exposes metrics using Prometheus format\n+- Uses ParentBased(AlwaysOn) sampler\n+- Uses standard random IDs\n+- Uses a default Resource which simply consists of the SDK (or any other resources we decide to)\n+include in the core SDK, not extensions\n+- Uses the default Clock, which uses Java 8 / 9+ optimized APIs for getting time\n+  - The only real reason a user would set this is for unit tests, not for production\n+- Enforces default numeric limits related to number of attribute, etc\n+\n+Because the exporting is often the only aspect an end user needs to configure, this is the simplest\n+possible API for configuring the SDK.\n+\n+Let's look at a more complicated example\n+\n+```java\n+OpenTelemetrySdk openTelemetry = OpenTelemetrySdk.builder()\n+  .setResource(Resource.getDefault().merge(CoolResource.getDefault()))\n+  .setClock(AtomicClock.create())\n+  .setPropagators(B3Propagator.getInstance())\n+  .addSpanExporter(OtlpGrpcSpanExporter.builder()\n+    .setEndpoint(\"spans-service:4317\")\n+    .setTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(10))\n+    .setBatchQueueSize(10000)\n+    .build())\n+  .addSpanExporter(ZipkinExporter.builder()\n+    .setEndpoint(\"spans-service:4317\")\n+    .disableBatching()\n+    .build())\n+  .addSpanExporter(FullyAsyncZipkinExporter.create())\n+  .addSpanProcessor(CustomAttributeAddingProcessor.create())\n+  .addSpanProcessor(CustomEventAddingProcessor.create())\n+  .setTraceSampler(Sampler.rateLimiting())\n+  .setTraceLimits(TraceLimits.builder().setMaxAttributes(10).build())\n+  .setIdGenerator(TimestampedIdGenerator.create())\n+  .setMeterStuff(InProgressMetricsStuff.create())\n+  .build()\n+```\n+\n+This configures resource, clock, exporters, span processors, sampler, trace limits, and metrics.\n+Everything is exposed on the `OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder` to provide discoverability of all the parts\n+of the SDK and to let the SDK manage shared components - it is not possible to configure a different\n+`Resource` for tracing and metrics, something that would be a gotcha. Exporters are handled natively\n+given they are so important - even though the exporters are specified before span processors, they\n+will always be executed last to make sure all span processors appy to them. The exporter builders\n+inherit from a `ExporterBuilder` type of abstract class - it takes cafe of batching configuration to\n+avoid having to understand separate concepts like `BatchSpanProcessor`. Exporters that don't support\n+batching at all, like the custom `FullyAsyncZipkinExporter` don't have to. Note this can be\n+similarly achieved by having wrappers like `BatchExporter.wrap(OtlpGrpcSpanExporter.builder()...`\n+as well and is presented as one option.\n+\n+Note that parts can be separated to separate subconfig classes if it seems to make the API easier to\n+use. We would want to avoid duplication though, e.g., having two configurations that expect a\n+`Resource`.\n+\n+One thing to keep in mind is that it will be less common for an application developer to go this far\n+and we can expect it is actually framework developers that use the full configuration capabilities\n+of the SDK, likely by tying it to a separate configuration system.\n+\n+### Why build instances\n+\n+We have found that even at such an early stage of user adoption, users want to build instances of\n+the SDK.\n+\n+- Integrates with dependency injection, e.g., Spring, in a similar way as many other libraries\n+- Can allow having multiple instances in the same app, in multi-concern single-classloader scenarios\n+- Allow managing lifecycle of SDK, e.g., shutting down and starting along with the lifecycle of a\n+serverless runtime\n+\n+### Configuring the SDK in a framework\n+\n+It is extremely common for Java apps to be written using a dependency injection framework like\n+Spring, Guice, Dagger, HK, and many more. They will all follow a very similar pattern though.\n+\n+```java\n+@Component\n+public class OpenTelemetryModule {\n+  \n+  @Bean\n+  public OpenTelemetry openTelemetry(MonitoringConfig config) {\n+    OpenTelemetrySdk.builder()\n+      .setResource(Resource.getDefault().merge(CoolResource.getDefault()))\n+      .setClock(AtomicClock.create())\n+      .setPropagators(B3Propagator.getInstance())\n+      .addSpanExporter(OtlpGrpcSpanExporter.builder()\n+        .setEndpoint(config.getOtlpExporter().getEndpoint())\n+        .setTimeout(config.getOtlpExporter().getTimeout())\n+        .setBatchQueueSize(config.getOtlpExporter().getQueueSize())\n+        .build())\n+      .addSpanExporter(ZipkinExporter.builder()\n+        .setEndpoint(config.getZipkinExporter().getEndpoint())\n+        .disableBatching()\n+        .build())\n+      .addSpanExporter(FullyAsyncZipkinExporter.create())\n+      .addSpanProcessor(CustomAttributeAddingProcessor.create())\n+      .addSpanProcessor(CustomEventAddingProcessor.create())\n+      .setTraceSampler(config.getSamplingRate() != 0 \n+          ?

Because it\n+has a easy-to-reason lifecycle, being tied into the dependency ordering (even if dependency \n+injection happened to be done manually through constructor invocation), we encourage application\n+developers to only use it.\n+\n+However, there are corner cases where an instance cannot be injected. The famous example is MySQL -\n+MySQL interceptors are initialized by calling a default constructor, and there is no way to pass a\n+built instance of a signal provider. For this case, we must store an SDK instance into a global\n+variable. To reduce gotchas for application developers, the first SDK that is instantiated is stored\n+automatically in the global variable.\n+\n+Before an SDK has been set, access to the global SDK will throw an exception and will not return a\n+default. The global can only be used after an SDK has been configured. SDKs must be configured early\n+in an application to ensure it applies to all of the logic in the app, and this will generally be\n+ensured by the configuration framework such as Spring. For application developers, this restriction\n+should not have any effect one way or the other in the vast majority of cases.\n+\n+MySQL is the only known corner case that requires the global SDK instance. If such a corner case\n+didn't exist, we may not even support it in the first place.\n+\n+See special note with Java Agent below though.\n+\n+## Telemetry within SDK components\n+\n+SDK components, such as exporters or remote samplers, may want to emit telemetry for their own\n+processing. However, the SDK components must be initialized before the SDK can be fully built. We do\n+not support partially built SDK because one cannot reason about the behavior of it.

Because we cannot guess the configuration the user needs, we expect that the SDK must\n+be configured by the user before it can be used.\n+\n+Goals for configuring the SDK are\n+\n+- Discoverability of options\n+- Ease of use by end users, e.g., less complicated code required\n+- Avoid requiring duplicate configuration, which can lead to errors or confusion\n+- Provide good defaults where possible\n+\n+In Java, the builder pattern is common for configuring instances. Let's look at what that may look\n+like. The simplest configuration will be when a user wants to get a default experience, exporting\n+with a specific exporter to an endpoint.\n+\n+```java\n+OpenTelemetrySdk openTelemetry = OpenTelemetrySdk.builder()\n+  .addSpanExporter(OtlpGrpcSpanExporter.builder()\n+    .setEndpoint(\"spans-service:4317\")\n+    .build())\n+  .addMetricExposition(PrometheusExposition.getDefault())\n+  .build();\n+```\n+\n+This\n+\n+- Exports spans using OTLP to spans-service\n+  - Uses the BatchSpanProcessor (or a batching exporter wraper) which we consider the best default \n+  for exporting. It has defaults for queue size, timeout, etc\n+- Exposes metrics using Prometheus format\n+- Uses ParentBased(AlwaysOn) sampler\n+- Uses standard random IDs\n+- Uses a default Resource which simply consists of the SDK (or any other resources we decide to)\n+include in the core SDK, not extensions\n+- Uses the default Clock, which uses Java 8 / 9+ optimized APIs for getting time\n+  - The only real reason a user would set this is for unit tests, not for production\n+- Enforces default numeric limits related to number of attribute, etc\n+\n+Because the exporting is often the only aspect an end user needs to configure, this is the simplest\n+possible API for configuring the SDK.\n+\n+Let's look at a more complicated example\n+\n+```java\n+OpenTelemetrySdk openTelemetry = OpenTelemetrySdk.builder()\n+  .setResource(Resource.getDefault().merge(CoolResource.getDefault()))\n+  .setClock(AtomicClock.create())\n+  .setPropagators(B3Propagator.getInstance())\n+  .addSpanExporter(OtlpGrpcSpanExporter.builder()\n+    .setEndpoint(\"spans-service:4317\")\n+    .setTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(10))\n+    .setBatchQueueSize(10000)\n+    .build())\n+  .addSpanExporter(ZipkinExporter.builder()\n+    .setEndpoint(\"spans-service:4317\")\n+    .disableBatching()\n+    .build())\n+  .addSpanExporter(FullyAsyncZipkinExporter.create())\n+  .addSpanProcessor(CustomAttributeAddingProcessor.create())\n+  .addSpanProcessor(CustomEventAddingProcessor.create())\n+  .setTraceSampler(Sampler.rateLimiting())\n+  .setTraceLimits(TraceLimits.builder().setMaxAttributes(10).build())\n+  .setIdGenerator(TimestampedIdGenerator.create())\n+  .setMeterStuff(InProgressMetricsStuff.create())\n+  .build()\n+```\n+\n+This configures resource, clock, exporters, span processors, sampler, trace limits, and metrics.\n+Everything is exposed on the `OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder` to provide discoverability of all the parts\n+of the SDK and to let the SDK manage shared components - it is not possible to configure a different\n+`Resource` for tracing and metrics, something that would be a gotcha. Exporters are handled natively\n+given they are so important - even though the exporters are specified before span processors, they\n+will always be executed last to make sure all span processors appy to them. The exporter builders\n+inherit from a `ExporterBuilder` type of abstract class - it takes care of batching configuration to\n+avoid having to understand separate concepts like `BatchSpanProcessor`.

Note this can be\n+similarly achieved by having wrappers like `BatchExporter.wrap(OtlpGrpcSpanExporter.builder()...`\n+as well and is presented as one option.\n+\n+Note that parts can be separated to separate subconfig classes if it seems to make the API easier to\n+use.

Because it\n+has a easy-to-reason lifecycle, being tied into the dependency ordering (even if dependency \n+injection happened to be done manually through constructor invocation), we encourage application\n+developers to only use it.\n+\n+However, there are corner cases where an instance cannot be injected. The famous example is MySQL -\n+MySQL interceptors are initialized by calling a default constructor, and there is no way to pass a\n+built instance of a signal provider. For this case, we must store an SDK instance into a global\n+variable. To reduce gotchas for application developers, the first SDK that is instantiated is stored\n+automatically in the global variable.\n+\n+Before an SDK has been set, access to the global SDK will throw an exception and will not return a\n+default. The global can only be used after an SDK has been configured. SDKs must be configured early\n+in an application to ensure it applies to all of the logic in the app, and this will generally be\n+ensured by the configuration framework such as Spring. For application developers, this restriction\n+should not have any effect one way or the other in the vast majority of cases.\n+\n+MySQL is the only known corner case that requires the global SDK instance. If such a corner case\n+didn't exist, we may not even support it in the first place.\n+\n+See special note with Java Agent below though.\n+\n+## Telemetry within SDK components\n+\n+SDK components, such as exporters or remote samplers, may want to emit telemetry for their own\n+processing. However, the SDK components must be initialized before the SDK can be fully built. We do\n+not support partially built SDK because one cannot reason about the behavior of it. Similarly we\n+do not support using the global instance of the SDK before it has been built. Therefore, SDK\n+components that require `OpenTelemetry` must accept it lazily. This is a restriction, but given\n+such components are rarely developed by application developers, and generally developed by either\n+framework authors or OpenTelemetry maintainers, this restriction is deemed reasonable.\n+\n+If this mechanism was built into the SDK, it may look like\n+\n+```java\n+interface OpenTelemetryComponent {\n+  default void setOpenTelemetry(OpenTelemetry openTelemetry) {}\n+}\n+interface SpanExporter extends OpenTelemetryComponent {\n+}\n+public class BatchExporter implements SpanExporter {\n+  \n+  private volatile Tracer tracer;\n+  \n+  @Override\n+  public void setOpenTelemetry(OpenTelemetry openTelemetry) {\n+    traer = openTelemetry.getTracerProvider().get(\"spanexporter\");\n+  }\n+  \n+  @Override\n+  public void export() {\n+    tracer.spanBuilder(\"export\").startSpan();\n+  }\n+}\n+public class OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder {\n+  public OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder addSpanExporter(SpanExporter exporter) {\n+    tracerProvider.addSpanExporter(exporter);\n+    components.add(exporter);\n+  }\n+\n+  public OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder setSampler(Sampler sampler) {\n+    tracerProvider.setSampler(sampler);\n+    components.add(sampler);\n+  }\n+\n+  public OpenTelemetry build() {\n+    OpenTelemetrySdk sdk = new OpenTelemetrySdk(tracerProvider.build(), meterProvider.build());\n+    for (OpenTelemetryComponent component : components) {\n+      component.setOpenTelemetry(sdk);\n+    }\n+  }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+A framework author will have an even easier time since most dependency injection frameworks\n+natively support lazy injection.\n+\n+```java\n+@Component\n+public class MonitoringModule {\n+  \n+  @Bean\n+  @ForSpanExporter\n+  public Tracer tracer(TracerProvider tracerProvider) {\n+    return tracerProvider.get(\"spanexporter\");\n+  }\n+}\n+\n+@Component\n+public class MyExporter implements SpanExporter {\n+\n+  private Lazy<Tracer> tracer;\n+  \n+  @Inject\n+  public MyExporter(@ForSpanExporter Lazy<Tracer> tracer) {\n+    this.tracer = tracer;\n+  }\n+  \n+  @Override\n+  public void export() {\n+    tracer.get().spanBuilder(\"export\").startSpan();\n+  }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+## Immutability of OpenTelemetry configuration\n+\n+The above attempts to avoid allowing a built SDK to be mutated.

It is a\n+continuation of discussion started with https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/issues/2022.\n+\n+## Target audiences\n+\n+There are a few different target audiences that are related to our configuration story.\n+\n+- Application developers, aka end-users. Often have no knowledge of tracing but want to add \n+OpenTelemetry to their app and see traces show up in a console. Application developers will increase\n+in number forever, while the below are more constant.\n+\n+- Dev-ops / framework developers. Write components or frameworks to support providing tracing to\n+their application developers. May write custom SDK extensions such as exporters, samplers, to fit\n+with their internal infrastructure and as such have some familiarity with tracing at least as the\n+SDK presents it.\n+\n+- OpenTelemetry maintainers. Write the SDK code.\n+\n+When making decisions, especially about complexity, we always prioritize the application developers,\n+then framework developers, then maintainers. This is because we expect those with less domain\n+knowledge about tracing to require a simpler experience than those with more. There is also more\n+bang-for-the-buck by making the end-user experience as streamlined as possible since we expect there\n+to be much more of them than other audiences.\n+\n+## Goals and non-goals\n+\n+### Goals\n+\n+- Provide a single entrypoint to configuring the SDK. For end-users, less familiar with the SDK, we\n+want to have everything together to provide discoverability and simpler end-user code.\n+\n+- Fit well with common Java idioms such as dependency injection, or common frameworks like Spring.\n+\n+- Reduce the chance of gotchas or configuration mishaps.\n+\n+- Aim for optimal performance for the most common use case.\n+\n+### Non-goals\n+\n+- Provide the best possible experience for custom SDKs. Generally the burden of the experience for\n+custom SDKs can fall on their authors, we optimize for our standard usage, the full SDK. Any\n+reference to \"the SDK\" in this document refers to the full SDK with all signals.\n+\n+- Make sure everything is auto-configurable. This is out of the scope of the SDK, and instead is\n+left to auto-configuration layers, which are also described below but not as part of the core SDK. \n+In partiular, SignalProvider SPIs which currently exist are proposed to be removed from the SDK. The \n+SDK may provide an autoconfiguration extension as an option which is not internal to the main SDK \n+components.\n+\n+## Configuring an instance of the SDK\n+\n+The SDK consists of configuration options for all the signals it supports. Users all have different\n+requirements for how they use the SDK, for example they may use different exporters depending on\n+their backend. Because we cannot guess the configuration the user needs, we expect that the SDK must\n+be configured by the user before it can be used.\n+\n+Goals for configuring the SDK are\n+\n+- Discoverability of options\n+- Ease of use by end users, e.g., less complicated code required\n+- Avoid requiring duplicate configuration, which can lead to errors or confusion\n+- Provide good defaults where possible\n+\n+In Java, the builder pattern is common for configuring instances. Let's look at what that may look\n+like. The simplest configuration will be when a user wants to get a default experience, exporting\n+with a specific exporter to an endpoint.\n+\n+```java\n+OpenTelemetrySdk openTelemetry = OpenTelemetrySdk.builder()\n+  .addSpanExporter(OtlpGrpcSpanExporter.builder()\n+    .setEndpoint(\"spans-service:4317\")\n+    .build())\n+  .addMetricExposition(PrometheusExposition.getDefault())\n+  .build();\n+```\n+\n+This\n+\n+- Exports spans using OTLP to spans-service\n+  - Uses the BatchSpanProcessor (or a batching exporter wraper) which we consider the best default \n+  for exporting. It has defaults for queue size, timeout, etc\n+- Exposes metrics using Prometheus format\n+- Uses ParentBased(AlwaysOn) sampler\n+- Uses standard random IDs\n+- Uses a default Resource which simply consists of the SDK (or any other resources we decide to)\n+include in the core SDK, not extensions\n+- Uses the default Clock, which uses Java 8 / 9+ optimized APIs for getting time\n+  - The only real reason a user would set this is for unit tests, not for production\n+- Enforces default numeric limits related to number of attribute, etc\n+\n+Because the exporting is often the only aspect an end user needs to configure, this is the simplest\n+possible API for configuring the SDK.\n+\n+Let's look at a more complicated example\n+\n+```java\n+OpenTelemetrySdk openTelemetry = OpenTelemetrySdk.builder()\n+  .setResource(Resource.getDefault().merge(CoolResource.getDefault()))\n+  .setClock(AtomicClock.create())\n+  .setPropagators(B3Propagator.getInstance())\n+  .addSpanExporter(OtlpGrpcSpanExporter.builder()\n+    .setEndpoint(\"spans-service:4317\")\n+    .setTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(10))\n+    .setBatchQueueSize(10000)\n+    .build())\n+  .addSpanExporter(ZipkinExporter.builder()\n+    .setEndpoint(\"spans-service:4317\")\n+    .disableBatching()\n+    .build())\n+  .addSpanExporter(FullyAsyncZipkinExporter.create())\n+  .addSpanProcessor(CustomAttributeAddingProcessor.create())\n+  .addSpanProcessor(CustomEventAddingProcessor.create())\n+  .setTraceSampler(Sampler.rateLimiting())\n+  .setTraceLimits(TraceLimits.builder().setMaxAttributes(10).build())\n+  .setIdGenerator(TimestampedIdGenerator.create())\n+  .setMeterStuff(InProgressMetricsStuff.create())\n+  .build()\n+```\n+\n+This configures resource, clock, exporters, span processors, sampler, trace limits, and metrics.\n+Everything is exposed on the `OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder` to provide discoverability of all the parts\n+of the SDK and to let the SDK manage shared components - it is not possible to configure a different\n+`Resource` for tracing and metrics, something that would be a gotcha. Exporters are handled natively\n+given they are so important - even though the exporters are specified before span processors, they\n+will always be executed last to make sure all span processors appy to them. The exporter builders\n+inherit from a `ExporterBuilder` type of abstract class - it takes care of batching configuration to\n+avoid having to understand separate concepts like `BatchSpanProcessor`. Exporters that don't support\n+batching at all, like the custom `FullyAsyncZipkinExporter` don't have to.

Application developers will increase\n+in number forever, while the below are more constant.\n+\n+- Dev-ops / framework developers.

Write the SDK code.\n+\n+When making decisions, especially about complexity, we always prioritize the application developers,\n+then framework developers, then maintainers. This is because we expect those with less domain\n+knowledge about tracing to require a simpler experience than those with more. There is also more\n+bang-for-the-buck by making the end-user experience as streamlined as possible since we expect there\n+to be much more of them than other audiences.\n+\n+## Goals and non-goals\n+\n+### Goals\n+\n+- Provide a single entrypoint to configuring the SDK. For end-users, less familiar with the SDK, we\n+want to have everything together to provide discoverability and simpler end-user code.\n+\n+- Fit well with common Java idioms such as dependency injection, or common frameworks like Spring.\n+\n+- Reduce the chance of gotchas or configuration mishaps.\n+\n+- Aim for optimal performance for the most common use case.\n+\n+### Non-goals\n+\n+- Provide the best possible experience for custom SDKs. Generally the burden of the experience for\n+custom SDKs can fall on their authors, we optimize for our standard usage, the full SDK. Any\n+reference to \"the SDK\" in this document refers to the full SDK with all signals.\n+\n+- Make sure everything is auto-configurable. This is out of the scope of the SDK, and instead is\n+left to auto-configuration layers, which are also described below but not as part of the core SDK. \n+In partiular, SignalProvider SPIs which currently exist are proposed to be removed from the SDK. The \n+SDK may provide an autoconfiguration extension as an option which is not internal to the main SDK \n+components.\n+\n+## Configuring an instance of the SDK\n+\n+The SDK consists of configuration options for all the signals it supports. Users all have different\n+requirements for how they use the SDK, for example they may use different exporters depending on\n+their backend. Because we cannot guess the configuration the user needs, we expect that the SDK must\n+be configured by the user before it can be used.\n+\n+Goals for configuring the SDK are\n+\n+- Discoverability of options\n+- Ease of use by end users, e.g., less complicated code required\n+- Avoid requiring duplicate configuration, which can lead to errors or confusion\n+- Provide good defaults where possible\n+\n+In Java, the builder pattern is common for configuring instances. Let's look at what that may look\n+like. The simplest configuration will be when a user wants to get a default experience, exporting\n+with a specific exporter to an endpoint.\n+\n+```java\n+OpenTelemetrySdk openTelemetry = OpenTelemetrySdk.builder()\n+  .addSpanExporter(OtlpGrpcSpanExporter.builder()\n+    .setEndpoint(\"spans-service:4317\")\n+    .build())\n+  .addMetricExposition(PrometheusExposition.getDefault())\n+  .build();\n+```\n+\n+This\n+\n+- Exports spans using OTLP to spans-service\n+  - Uses the BatchSpanProcessor (or a batching exporter wraper) which we consider the best default \n+  for exporting. It has defaults for queue size, timeout, etc\n+- Exposes metrics using Prometheus format\n+- Uses ParentBased(AlwaysOn) sampler\n+- Uses standard random IDs\n+- Uses a default Resource which simply consists of the SDK (or any other resources we decide to)\n+include in the core SDK, not extensions\n+- Uses the default Clock, which uses Java 8 / 9+ optimized APIs for getting time\n+  - The only real reason a user would set this is for unit tests, not for production\n+- Enforces default numeric limits related to number of attribute, etc\n+\n+Because the exporting is often the only aspect an end user needs to configure, this is the simplest\n+possible API for configuring the SDK.\n+\n+Let's look at a more complicated example\n+\n+```java\n+OpenTelemetrySdk openTelemetry = OpenTelemetrySdk.builder()\n+  .setResource(Resource.getDefault().merge(CoolResource.getDefault()))\n+  .setClock(AtomicClock.create())\n+  .setPropagators(B3Propagator.getInstance())\n+  .addSpanExporter(OtlpGrpcSpanExporter.builder()\n+    .setEndpoint(\"spans-service:4317\")\n+    .setTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(10))\n+    .setBatchQueueSize(10000)\n+    .build())\n+  .addSpanExporter(ZipkinExporter.builder()\n+    .setEndpoint(\"spans-service:4317\")\n+    .disableBatching()\n+    .build())\n+  .addSpanExporter(FullyAsyncZipkinExporter.create())\n+  .addSpanProcessor(CustomAttributeAddingProcessor.create())\n+  .addSpanProcessor(CustomEventAddingProcessor.create())\n+  .setTraceSampler(Sampler.rateLimiting())\n+  .setTraceLimits(TraceLimits.builder().setMaxAttributes(10).build())\n+  .setIdGenerator(TimestampedIdGenerator.create())\n+  .setMeterStuff(InProgressMetricsStuff.create())\n+  .build()\n+```\n+\n+This configures resource, clock, exporters, span processors, sampler, trace limits, and metrics.\n+Everything is exposed on the `OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder` to provide discoverability of all the parts\n+of the SDK and to let the SDK manage shared components - it is not possible to configure a different\n+`Resource` for tracing and metrics, something that would be a gotcha. Exporters are handled natively\n+given they are so important - even though the exporters are specified before span processors, they\n+will always be executed last to make sure all span processors appy to them. The exporter builders\n+inherit from a `ExporterBuilder` type of abstract class - it takes care of batching configuration to\n+avoid having to understand separate concepts like `BatchSpanProcessor`. Exporters that don't support\n+batching at all, like the custom `FullyAsyncZipkinExporter` don't have to. Note this can be\n+similarly achieved by having wrappers like `BatchExporter.wrap(OtlpGrpcSpanExporter.builder()...`\n+as well and is presented as one option.\n+\n+Note that parts can be separated to separate subconfig classes if it seems to make the API easier to\n+use. We would want to avoid duplication though, e.g., having two configurations that expect a\n+`Resource`.\n+\n+One thing to keep in mind is that it will be less common for an application developer to go this far\n+and we can expect it is actually framework developers that use the full configuration capabilities\n+of the SDK, likely by tying it to a separate configuration system.\n+\n+### Why build instances\n+\n+We have found that even at such an early stage of user adoption, users want to build instances of\n+the SDK.\n+\n+- Integrates with dependency injection, e.g., Spring, in a similar way as many other libraries\n+- Can allow having multiple instances in the same app, in multi-concern single-classloader scenarios\n+- Allow managing lifecycle of SDK, e.g., shutting down and starting along with the lifecycle of a\n+serverless runtime\n+\n+### Configuring the SDK in a framework\n+\n+It is extremely common for Java apps to be written using a dependency injection framework like\n+Spring, Guice, Dagger, HK, and many more. They will all follow a very similar pattern though.\n+\n+```java\n+@Component\n+public class OpenTelemetryModule {\n+  \n+  @Bean\n+  public OpenTelemetry openTelemetry(MonitoringConfig config) {\n+    OpenTelemetrySdk.builder()\n+      .setResource(Resource.getDefault().merge(CoolResource.getDefault()))\n+      .setClock(AtomicClock.create())\n+      .setPropagators(B3Propagator.getInstance())\n+      .addSpanExporter(OtlpGrpcSpanExporter.builder()\n+        .setEndpoint(config.getOtlpExporter().getEndpoint())\n+        .setTimeout(config.getOtlpExporter().getTimeout())\n+        .setBatchQueueSize(config.getOtlpExporter().getQueueSize())\n+        .build())\n+      .addSpanExporter(ZipkinExporter.builder()\n+        .setEndpoint(config.getZipkinExporter().getEndpoint())\n+        .disableBatching()\n+        .build())\n+      .addSpanExporter(FullyAsyncZipkinExporter.create())\n+      .addSpanProcessor(CustomAttributeAddingProcessor.create())\n+      .addSpanProcessor(CustomEventAddingProcessor.create())\n+      .setTraceSampler(config.getSamplingRate() != 0 \n+          ?

Because it\n+has a easy-to-reason lifecycle, being tied into the dependency ordering (even if dependency \n+injection happened to be done manually through constructor invocation), we encourage application\n+developers to only use it.\n+\n+However, there are corner cases where an instance cannot be injected. The famous example is MySQL -\n+MySQL interceptors are initialized by calling a default constructor, and there is no way to pass a\n+built instance of a signal provider. For this case, we must store an SDK instance into a global\n+variable. To reduce gotchas for application developers, the first SDK that is instantiated is stored\n+automatically in the global variable.\n+\n+Before an SDK has been set, access to the global SDK will throw an exception and will not return a\n+default. The global can only be used after an SDK has been configured. SDKs must be configured early\n+in an application to ensure it applies to all of the logic in the app, and this will generally be\n+ensured by the configuration framework such as Spring. For application developers, this restriction\n+should not have any effect one way or the other in the vast majority of cases.\n+\n+MySQL is the only known corner case that requires the global SDK instance. If such a corner case\n+didn't exist, we may not even support it in the first place.\n+\n+See special note with Java Agent below though.\n+\n+## Telemetry within SDK components\n+\n+SDK components, such as exporters or remote samplers, may want to emit telemetry for their own\n+processing. However, the SDK components must be initialized before the SDK can be fully built. We do\n+not support partially built SDK because one cannot reason about the behavior of it. Similarly we\n+do not support using the global instance of the SDK before it has been built. Therefore, SDK\n+components that require `OpenTelemetry` must accept it lazily. This is a restriction, but given\n+such components are rarely developed by application developers, and generally developed by either\n+framework authors or OpenTelemetry maintainers, this restriction is deemed reasonable.\n+\n+If this mechanism was built into the SDK, it may look like\n+\n+```java\n+interface OpenTelemetryComponent {\n+  default void setOpenTelemetry(OpenTelemetry openTelemetry) {}\n+}\n+interface SpanExporter extends OpenTelemetryComponent {\n+}\n+public class BatchExporter implements SpanExporter {\n+  \n+  private volatile Tracer tracer;\n+  \n+  @Override\n+  public void setOpenTelemetry(OpenTelemetry openTelemetry) {\n+    traer = openTelemetry.getTracerProvider().get(\"spanexporter\");\n+  }\n+  \n+  @Override\n+  public void export() {\n+    tracer.spanBuilder(\"export\").startSpan();\n+  }\n+}\n+public class OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder {\n+  public OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder addSpanExporter(SpanExporter exporter) {\n+    tracerProvider.addSpanExporter(exporter);\n+    components.add(exporter);\n+  }\n+\n+  public OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder setSampler(Sampler sampler) {\n+    tracerProvider.setSampler(sampler);\n+    components.add(sampler);\n+  }\n+\n+  public OpenTelemetry build() {\n+    OpenTelemetrySdk sdk = new OpenTelemetrySdk(tracerProvider.build(), meterProvider.build());\n+    for (OpenTelemetryComponent component : components) {\n+      component.setOpenTelemetry(sdk);\n+    }\n+  }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+A framework author will have an even easier time since most dependency injection frameworks\n+natively support lazy injection.\n+\n+```java\n+@Component\n+public class MonitoringModule {\n+  \n+  @Bean\n+  @ForSpanExporter\n+  public Tracer tracer(TracerProvider tracerProvider) {\n+    return tracerProvider.get(\"spanexporter\");\n+  }\n+}\n+\n+@Component\n+public class MyExporter implements SpanExporter {\n+\n+  private Lazy<Tracer> tracer;\n+  \n+  @Inject\n+  public MyExporter(@ForSpanExporter Lazy<Tracer> tracer) {\n+    this.tracer = tracer;\n+  }\n+  \n+  @Override\n+  public void export() {\n+    tracer.get().spanBuilder(\"export\").startSpan();\n+  }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+## Immutability of OpenTelemetry configuration\n+\n+The above attempts to avoid allowing a built SDK to be mutated. Allowing mutation can make code\n+harder to reason about (any component, even deep in business logic, could update the SDK without\n+hindrance), can reduce performance (require volatile read on most operations), and produce thread\n+safety issues if not well implemented. In particular, compared to the current state as of writing,\n+\n+- `addSpanProcessor` is not needed because we instead push the complexity of handling telemetry\n+within telemetry components to those components, where the maintainers will have more domain\n+knowledge. It allows this mutator method to be removed from the end-user API.\n+\n+- `updateTraceConfig` - instead of allowing updates at the top level, we should consider making\n+`TraceConfig` an interface, and the SDK default implementation is static. It allows the above\n+benefits of immutability to be in place for the common case where dynamic updates are not needed.\n+Where dynamic updates are needed, it can be replaced with a mutable implementation instead of making\n+the SDK configuration mutable. This keeps update methods out of the end-user APIs and will generally\n+give framework developers more control by handling dynamicism themselves without the chance of\n+end-users to affect it negatively.\n+\n+Some highly buggy code that could be enabled by mutability.\n+\n+```java\n+\n+class SleuthUsingService {\n+  \n+  @Inject\n+  private OpenTelemetry openTelemetry;\n+\n+  public void doLogic() {\n+    // My logic is important, so always sample it!\n+    OpenTelemetrySdk.getTracerManagement().updateTraceConfig(config -> config.setSampler(ALWAYS_ON));\n+    // This service was able to affect other services, even though Sleuth intends to\n+    // \"manage the SDK\". Unlike the javaagent, it can't block access to SDK methods we may provide.\n+    doSampledLogicWhileOtherServicesAlsoGetSampled();\n+  }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+\n+## Auto-configuration\n+\n+The above presents programmatic configuration for the SDK and proposeds that the core SDK has no\n+other mechanism for configuration. There is no SPI nor processing of environment variables or\n+system properties. There are many mechanisms for configuration, for example Spring Boot. \n+Integration with these systems becomes easier to reason about if we consider auto-configuration at\n+a layer above the core SDK.\n+\n+### Java Auto-Instrumentation Agent\n+\n+Java Auto-Instrumentation Agent is the primary means of automatically configuring the SDK. It\n+contains system properties, environment variables, and SPIs for allowing a user to have a fully\n+setup tracing configuration just by applying the agent. In fact, the agent does not even allow a\n+user to use the SDK directly, actively blocking it. Instead of having a situation where some\n+configuration is automatic in the core SDK and some in the agent, we can move it all to the agent.\n+The agent already exposes exporter SPIs - it can also expose SPIs for customization of the SDK\n+components that are manually configured above.\n+\n+- We could consider having a very similar autoconfiguration wrapper artifact as an SDK extension too.\n+But we would assume the core SDK is always manually configured.\n+\n+To allow users of the agent to apply tracing to their own code, the agent should attempt to\n+instrument dependency injection to provide an instance of `OpenTelemetry` using the agent-configured\n+SDK, for example it should add it to the Spring `ApplicationContext`. For cases where dependency\n+injection is not available, though, there is no option but to provide access to the SDK through a\n+global variable. We can expect such usage to still function correctly even if the agent is removed\n+and a different configuration mechanism is used, such as manual configuration as above, or Spring\n+Sleuth.\n+\n+### Spring Sleuth\n+\n+[Spring Sleuth](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-sleuth) (or any similar observability-aware server framework such as \n+[curio-server-framework](https://github.com/curioswitch/curiostack/blob/master/common/server/framework/src/main/java/org/curioswitch/common/server/framework/monitoring/MonitoringModule.java)\n+or internal frameworks developed by devops teams at companies) is also a mechanism for automatically\n+configuring the SDK. In general, we would expect Sleuth users to not be using the java agent.\n+\n+Examples of how Sleuth could work are presented above in examples using `@Bean`. In particular, we\n+expect it to have its own set of configuration properties - by making sure we don't implement\n+configuration properties in the core SDK, only configuration layers like the agent or a possible\n+configuration wrapper, we avoid the possibility of confusion by having duplicate variables (in\n+practice, OpenTelemetry naming would likely be ignored and overwritten by Spring naming).\n+\n+## Partial SDKs", "originalCommit": "c60b399bbac5d863c1517a1c50d98279e1d7cffb", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0MDAyOTMyMw==", "url": "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/pull/2262#discussion_r540029323", "bodyText": "OpenTelwetrySdk is only present in the full SDK artifact (-all).

It has defaults for queue size, timeout, etc\n+- Exposes metrics using Prometheus format\n+- Uses ParentBased(AlwaysOn) sampler\n+- Uses standard random IDs\n+- Uses a default Resource which simply consists of the SDK (or any other resources we decide to)\n+include in the core SDK, not extensions\n+- Uses the default Clock, which uses Java 8 / 9+ optimized APIs for getting time\n+  - The only real reason a user would set this is for unit tests, not for production\n+- Enforces default numeric limits related to number of attribute, etc\n+\n+Because the exporting is often the only aspect an end user needs to configure, this is the simplest\n+possible API for configuring the SDK.\n+\n+Let's look at a more complicated example\n+\n+```java\n+OpenTelemetrySdk openTelemetry = OpenTelemetrySdk.builder()\n+  .setResource(Resource.getDefault().merge(CoolResource.getDefault()))\n+  .setClock(AtomicClock.create())\n+  .setPropagators(B3Propagator.getInstance())\n+  .addSpanExporter(OtlpGrpcSpanExporter.builder()\n+    .setEndpoint(\"spans-service:4317\")\n+    .setTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(10))\n+    .setBatchQueueSize(10000)\n+    .build())\n+  .addSpanExporter(ZipkinExporter.builder()\n+    .setEndpoint(\"spans-service:4317\")\n+    .disableBatching()\n+    .build())\n+  .addSpanExporter(FullyAsyncZipkinExporter.create())\n+  .addSpanProcessor(CustomAttributeAddingProcessor.create())\n+  .addSpanProcessor(CustomEventAddingProcessor.create())\n+  .setTraceSampler(Sampler.rateLimiting())\n+  .setTraceLimits(TraceLimits.builder().setMaxAttributes(10).build())\n+  .setIdGenerator(TimestampedIdGenerator.create())\n+  .setMeterStuff(InProgressMetricsStuff.create())\n+  .build()\n+```\n+\n+This configures resource, clock, exporters, span processors, sampler, trace limits, and metrics.\n+Everything is exposed on the `OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder` to provide discoverability of all the parts\n+of the SDK and to let the SDK manage shared components - it is not possible to configure a different\n+`Resource` for tracing and metrics, something that would be a gotcha. Exporters are handled natively\n+given they are so important - even though the exporters are specified before span processors, they\n+will always be executed last to make sure all span processors appy to them. The exporter builders\n+inherit from a `ExporterBuilder` type of abstract class - it takes care of batching configuration to\n+avoid having to understand separate concepts like `BatchSpanProcessor`. Exporters that don't support\n+batching at all, like the custom `FullyAsyncZipkinExporter` don't have to. Note this can be\n+similarly achieved by having wrappers like `BatchExporter.wrap(OtlpGrpcSpanExporter.builder()...`\n+as well and is presented as one option.\n+\n+Note that parts can be separated to separate subconfig classes if it seems to make the API easier to\n+use. We would want to avoid duplication though, e.g., having two configurations that expect a\n+`Resource`.\n+\n+One thing to keep in mind is that it will be less common for an application developer to go this far\n+and we can expect it is actually framework developers that use the full configuration capabilities\n+of the SDK, likely by tying it to a separate configuration system.\n+\n+### Why build instances\n+\n+We have found that even at such an early stage of user adoption, users want to build instances of\n+the SDK.\n+\n+- Integrates with dependency injection, e.g., Spring, in a similar way as many other libraries\n+- Can allow having multiple instances in the same app, in multi-concern single-classloader scenarios\n+- Allow managing lifecycle of SDK, e.g., shutting down and starting along with the lifecycle of a\n+serverless runtime\n+\n+### Configuring the SDK in a framework\n+\n+It is extremely common for Java apps to be written using a dependency injection framework like\n+Spring, Guice, Dagger, HK, and many more.

The \n+SDK may provide an autoconfiguration extension as an option which is not internal to the main SDK \n+components.\n+\n+## Configuring an instance of the SDK\n+\n+The SDK consists of configuration options for all the signals it supports. Users all have different\n+requirements for how they use the SDK, for example they may use different exporters depending on\n+their backend. Because we cannot guess the configuration the user needs, we expect that the SDK must\n+be configured by the user before it can be used.\n+\n+Goals for configuring the SDK are\n+\n+- Discoverability of options\n+- Ease of use by end users, e.g., less complicated code required\n+- Avoid requiring duplicate configuration, which can lead to errors or confusion\n+- Provide good defaults where possible\n+\n+In Java, the builder pattern is common for configuring instances. Let's look at what that may look\n+like. The simplest configuration will be when a user wants to get a default experience, exporting\n+with a specific exporter to an endpoint.\n+\n+```java\n+OpenTelemetrySdk openTelemetry = OpenTelemetrySdk.builder()\n+  .addSpanExporter(OtlpGrpcSpanExporter.builder()\n+    .setEndpoint(\"spans-service:4317\")\n+    .build())\n+  .addMetricExposition(PrometheusExposition.getDefault())\n+  .build();\n+```\n+\n+This\n+\n+- Exports spans using OTLP to spans-service\n+  - Uses the BatchSpanProcessor (or a batching exporter wraper) which we consider the best default \n+  for exporting.

Exporters are handled natively\n+given they are so important - even though the exporters are specified before span processors, they\n+will always be executed last to make sure all span processors appy to them. The exporter builders\n+inherit from a `ExporterBuilder` type of abstract class - it takes care of batching configuration to\n+avoid having to understand separate concepts like `BatchSpanProcessor`.

In particular, compared to the current state as of writing,\n+\n+- `addSpanProcessor` is not needed because we instead push the complexity of handling telemetry\n+within telemetry components to those components, where the maintainers will have more domain\n+knowledge. It allows this mutator method to be removed from the end-user API.\n+\n+- `updateTraceConfig` - instead of allowing updates at the top level, we should consider making\n+`TraceConfig` an interface, and the SDK default implementation is static. It allows the above\n+benefits of immutability to be in place for the common case where dynamic updates are not needed.\n+Where dynamic updates are needed, it can be replaced with a mutable implementation instead of making\n+the SDK configuration mutable. This keeps update methods out of the end-user APIs and will generally\n+give framework developers more control by handling dynamicism themselves without the chance of\n+end-users to affect it negatively.\n+\n+Some highly buggy code that could be enabled by mutability.\n+\n+```java\n+\n+class SleuthUsingService {\n+  \n+  @Inject\n+  private OpenTelemetry openTelemetry;\n+\n+  public void doLogic() {\n+    // My logic is important, so always sample it!\n+    OpenTelemetrySdk.getTracerManagement().updateTraceConfig(config -> config.setSampler(ALWAYS_ON));\n+    // This service was able to affect other services, even though Sleuth intends to\n+    // \"manage the SDK\". Unlike the javaagent, it can't block access to SDK methods we may provide.\n+    doSampledLogicWhileOtherServicesAlsoGetSampled();\n+  }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+\n+## Auto-configuration\n+\n+The above presents programmatic configuration for the SDK and proposeds that the core SDK has no\n+other mechanism for configuration. There is no SPI nor processing of environment variables or\n+system properties. There are many mechanisms for configuration, for example Spring Boot. \n+Integration with these systems becomes easier to reason about if we consider auto-configuration at\n+a layer above the core SDK.\n+\n+### Java Auto-Instrumentation Agent\n+\n+Java Auto-Instrumentation Agent is the primary means of automatically configuring the SDK. It\n+contains system properties, environment variables, and SPIs for allowing a user to have a fully\n+setup tracing configuration just by applying the agent. In fact, the agent does not even allow a\n+user to use the SDK directly, actively blocking it. Instead of having a situation where some\n+configuration is automatic in the core SDK and some in the agent, we can move it all to the agent.\n+The agent already exposes exporter SPIs - it can also expose SPIs for customization of the SDK\n+components that are manually configured above.\n+\n+- We could consider having a very similar autoconfiguration wrapper artifact as an SDK extension too.\n+But we would assume the core SDK is always manually configured.\n+\n+To allow users of the agent to apply tracing to their own code, the agent should attempt to\n+instrument dependency injection to provide an instance of `OpenTelemetry` using the agent-configured\n+SDK, for example it should add it to the Spring `ApplicationContext`. For cases where dependency\n+injection is not available, though, there is no option but to provide access to the SDK through a\n+global variable. We can expect such usage to still function correctly even if the agent is removed\n+and a different configuration mechanism is used, such as manual configuration as above, or Spring\n+Sleuth.\n+\n+### Spring Sleuth\n+\n+[Spring Sleuth](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-sleuth) (or any similar observability-aware server framework such as \n+[curio-server-framework](https://github.com/curioswitch/curiostack/blob/master/common/server/framework/src/main/java/org/curioswitch/common/server/framework/monitoring/MonitoringModule.java)\n+or internal frameworks developed by devops teams at companies) is also a mechanism for automatically\n+configuring the SDK. In general, we would expect Sleuth users to not be using the java agent.\n+\n+Examples of how Sleuth could work are presented above in examples using `@Bean`. In particular, we\n+expect it to have its own set of configuration properties - by making sure we don't implement\n+configuration properties in the core SDK, only configuration layers like the agent or a possible\n+configuration wrapper, we avoid the possibility of confusion by having duplicate variables (in\n+practice, OpenTelemetry naming would likely be ignored and overwritten by Spring naming).\n+\n+## Partial SDKs\n+\n+We allow implementing particular signals of the OpenTelemetry API without using our SDK. For example,\n+a MeterProvider may be implemented with micrometer. For this reason, each signal must also present\n+all of its options in the form of, e.g., `TracerSdkProviderBuilder`. We expect the vast majority of\n+users to use `OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder` - while there is some duplication with the signal provider\n+builder, it is work maintainers can do to present the simplest interface for the most common use\n+case of using the whole SDK.\n+\n+Without SPI, the way to initialize a partial SDK would be to use `DefaultOpenTelemetry`.\n+\n+```java\n+@Bean\n+public OpenTelemetry openTelemetry() {\n+  return DefaultOpenTelemetry.builder()\n+    .setTraceProvider(TracerSdkProvider.builder().build())\n+    .setMeterProvider(MicrometerProvider.builder().build())\n+    .build();\n+}\n+``` \n+\n+As this should be a fairly minor use case, and commonly handled by framework developers, this seems\n+reasonable. We can also hope that where it is important, it is the author of partial SDKs that\n+provide a one-stop-shop entrypoint.\n+\n+```java\n+@Bean\n+public OpenTelemetry openTelemetry() {\n+  return OpenTelemetrySdkWithMicrometer.builder()\n+    .addSpanExporter()\n+    .setMeterRegistry()\n+    .build();", "originalCommit": "c60b399bbac5d863c1517a1c50d98279e1d7cffb", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "21ce475dab269a1430a29a9b203875e49e73c5f2", "url": "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/commit/21ce475dab269a1430a29a9b203875e49e73c5f2", "message": "First some cleanups", "committedDate": "2020-12-11T08:22:59Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "92d2066ca18247cb830b3a2db889fab25303aa0a", "url": "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/commit/92d2066ca18247cb830b3a2db889fab25303aa0a", "message": "Merge branch 'configuration-doc' of github.com:anuraaga/opentelemetry-java into configuration-doc", "committedDate": "2020-12-11T08:25:45Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "ea727428a7399cffcc58725ca07c6525823722b3", "url": "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/commit/ea727428a7399cffcc58725ca07c6525823722b3", "message": "Revamp", "committedDate": "2020-12-11T09:03:21Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "26e344b7711bab9ab03fd41a3170b70de81a436b", "url": "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/commit/26e344b7711bab9ab03fd41a3170b70de81a436b", "message": "Global not magic", "committedDate": "2020-12-11T09:04:19Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0MDc5NzAyMg==", "url": "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/pull/2262#discussion_r540797022", "bodyText": "Realized there's probably no point for this class, it could only help if it coordinates Resource sharing, etc.", "author": "anuraaga", "createdAt": "2020-12-11T09:10:59Z", "path": "docs/sdk-configuration.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,608 @@\n+# Design for configuring the SDK\n+\n+This document outlines some of the goals we have for user configuration of the SDK.

Because it\n+has a easy-to-reason initialization ordering, being tied into the dependency ordering (even if dependency \n+injection happened to be done manually through constructor invocation), we encourage application\n+developers to only use it.\n+\n+However, there are corner cases where an instance cannot be injected. The famous example is MySQL -\n+MySQL interceptors are initialized by calling a default constructor, and there is no way to pass a\n+built instance of a signal provider. For this case, we must store an SDK instance into a global\n+variable. It is expected that frameworks or end-users will set the SDK as the global to support\n+instrumentation that requires this.\n+\n+Before an SDK has been set, access to the global `OpenTelemetry` will return a no-op \n+`DefaultOpenTelemetry`. This is because it is possible library instrumentation is using the global,\n+and it may even use it during the processing of a request (rather than only at initialization time).\n+For this reason, we cannot throw an exception. Instead, if the SDK is detected on the classpath, we\n+will log a `SEVERE` warning once-only indicating the API has been accessed before the SDK configured\n+with directions on how a user could solve the problem. SDKs must be configured early\n+in an application to ensure it applies to all of the logic in the app, and this will generally be\n+ensured by the configuration framework such as Spring. For application developers, this restriction\n+should not have any effect one way or the other in the vast majority of cases.\n+\n+MySQL is the only known corner case that requires the global SDK instance. If such a corner case\n+didn't exist, we may not even support it in the first place.\n+\n+See special note about Java Agent below though.\n+\n+## Telemetry within SDK components\n+\n+SDK components, such as exporters or remote samplers, may want to emit telemetry for their own\n+processing. However, the SDK components must be initialized before the SDK can be fully built. We do\n+not support partially built SDK because one cannot reason about the behavior of it. Similarly we\n+do not support using the global instance of the SDK before it has been built. Therefore, SDK\n+components that require `OpenTelemetry` must accept it lazily. This is a restriction, but given\n+such components are rarely developed by application developers, and generally developed by either\n+framework authors or OpenTelemetry maintainers, this restriction is deemed reasonable.\n+\n+If this mechanism was built into the SDK, it may look like\n+\n+```java\n+interface OpenTelemetryComponent {\n+  default void setOpenTelemetry(OpenTelemetry openTelemetry) {}\n+}\n+interface SpanExporter extends OpenTelemetryComponent {\n+}\n+public class BatchExporter implements SpanExporter {\n+  \n+  private volatile Tracer tracer;\n+  \n+  @Override\n+  public void setOpenTelemetry(OpenTelemetry openTelemetry) {\n+        tracer = openTelemetry.getTracerProvider().get(\"spanexporter\");\n+  }\n+  \n+  @Override\n+  public void export() {\n+        Tracer tracer = this.tracer;\n+        if (tracer != null) {\n+          tracer.spanBuilder(\"export\").startSpan();\n+        }\n+  }\n+}\n+public class OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder {\n+    public OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder addSpanExporter(SpanExporter exporter) {\n+        tracerProvider.addSpanExporter(exporter);\n+        components.add(exporter);\n+    }\n+    \n+    public OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder setSampler(Sampler sampler) {\n+        tracerProvider.setSampler(sampler);\n+        components.add(sampler);\n+    }\n+    \n+    public OpenTelemetry build() {\n+        OpenTelemetrySdk sdk = new OpenTelemetrySdk(tracerProvider.build(), meterProvider.build());\n+        for (OpenTelemetryComponent component : components) {\n+          component.setOpenTelemetry(sdk);\n+        }\n+    }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+A framework author will have an even easier time since most dependency injection frameworks\n+natively support lazy injection.\n+\n+```java\n+@Component\n+public class MonitoringModule {\n+  \n+    @Bean\n+    @ForSpanExporter\n+    public Tracer tracer(TracerProvider tracerProvider) {\n+    return tracerProvider.get(\"spanexporter\");\n+    }\n+}\n+\n+@Component\n+public class MyExporter implements SpanExporter {\n+\n+    private Lazy<Tracer> tracer;\n+    \n+    @Inject\n+    public MyExporter(@ForSpanExporter Lazy<Tracer> tracer) {\n+    this.tracer = tracer;\n+    }\n+    \n+    @Override\n+    public void export() {\n+    tracer.get().spanBuilder(\"export\").startSpan();\n+    }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+## Immutability of OpenTelemetry configuration\n+\n+The above attempts to avoid allowing a built SDK to be mutated. Allowing mutation can make code\n+harder to reason about (any component, even deep in business logic, could update the SDK without\n+hindrance), can reduce performance (require volatile read on most operations), and produce thread\n+safety issues if not well implemented. In particular, compared to the current state as of writing,\n+\n+- `addSpanProcessor` is not needed because we instead push the complexity of handling telemetry\n+within telemetry components to those components, where the maintainers will have more domain\n+knowledge. It allows this mutator method to be removed from the end-user API.\n+\n+- `updateTraceConfig` - instead of allowing updates at the top level, we should consider making\n+`TraceConfig` an interface, and the SDK default implementation is static. It allows the above\n+benefits of immutability to be in place for the common case where dynamic updates are not needed.\n+Where dynamic updates are needed, it can be replaced with a mutable implementation instead of making\n+the SDK configuration mutable. This keeps update methods out of the end-user APIs and will generally\n+give framework developers more control by handling dynamicism themselves without the chance of\n+end-users to affect it negatively.\n+\n+Some highly buggy code that could be enabled by mutability.\n+\n+```java\n+class SleuthUsingService {\n+  \n+  @Inject\n+  private OpenTelemetry openTelemetry;\n+\n+  public void doLogic() {\n+    // My logic is important, so always sample it!\n+    OpenTelemetrySdk.getTracerManagement().updateTraceConfig(config -> config.setSampler(ALWAYS_ON));\n+    // This service was able to affect other services, even though Sleuth intends to\n+    // \"manage the SDK\".

It is a\n+continuation of discussion started with https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/issues/2022.\n+\n+## Target audiences\n+\n+There are a few different target audiences that are related to our configuration story.\n+\n+- Application developers, aka end-users. Often have no knowledge of tracing but want to add \n+OpenTelemetry to their app and see traces show up in a console. Application developers will increase\n+in number forever, while the below are more constant.\n+\n+- Dev-ops / framework developers. Write components or frameworks to support providing tracing to\n+their application developers. May write custom SDK extensions such as exporters, samplers, to fit\n+with their internal infrastructure and as such have some familiarity with tracing at least as the\n+SDK presents it.\n+\n+- Telemetry extension authors. Write custom SDK extensions, often to support a particular backend.\n+Verify familiar with telemetry.\n+\n+- OpenTelemetry maintainers. Write the SDK code.\n+\n+When making decisions, especially about complexity, we always prioritize the application developers,\n+then framework developers, then maintainers. This is because we expect those with less domain\n+knowledge about tracing to require a simpler experience than those with more. There is also more\n+bang-for-the-buck by making the end-user experience as streamlined as possible since we expect there\n+to be much more of them than other audiences.\n+\n+## Goals and non-goals\n+\n+### Goals\n+\n+- Provide a single entrypoint to configuring the SDK. For end-users, less familiar with the SDK, we\n+want to have everything together to provide discoverability and simpler end-user code. If there are\n+several, clear use cases which benefit from different entrypoints, we could have multiple\n+corresponding to each one.\n+\n+- Fit well with common Java idioms such as dependency injection, or common frameworks like Spring.\n+\n+- Reduce the chance of gotchas or configuration mishaps.\n+\n+- Aim for optimal performance of the configured SDK for the most common use case.\n+\n+### Non-goals\n+\n+- Provide the best possible experience for custom SDKs. Generally the burden of the experience for\n+custom SDKs can fall on their authors, we optimize for our standard usage, the full SDK. Any\n+reference to \"the SDK\" in this document refers to the full SDK with all signals.\n+\n+- Make sure everything is auto-configurable. This is out of the scope of the SDK, and instead is\n+left to auto-configuration layers, which are also described below but not as part of the core SDK. \n+In partiular, SignalProvider SPIs which currently exist are proposed to be removed from the SDK. The \n+SDK may provide an autoconfiguration extension as an option which is not internal to the main SDK \n+components.\n+\n+## Configuring an instance of the SDK\n+\n+The SDK exposes configuration options for all the signals it supports. Users all have different\n+requirements for how they use the SDK; for example they may use different exporters depending on\n+their backend. Because we cannot guess the configuration the user needs, we expect that the SDK must\n+be configured by the user before it can be used.\n+\n+Goals for configuring the SDK are\n+\n+- Discoverability of options\n+- Ease of use by end users, e.g., less complicated code required\n+- Avoid requiring duplicate configuration, which can lead to errors or confusion\n+- Provide good defaults where possible\n+\n+In Java, the builder pattern is common for configuring instances.

It is a\n+continuation of discussion started with https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/issues/2022.\n+\n+## Target audiences\n+\n+There are a few different target audiences that are related to our configuration story.\n+\n+- Application developers, aka end-users. Often have no knowledge of tracing but want to add \n+OpenTelemetry to their app and see traces show up in a console. Application developers will increase\n+in number forever, while the below are more constant.\n+\n+- Dev-ops / framework developers. Write components or frameworks to support providing tracing to\n+their application developers. May write custom SDK extensions such as exporters, samplers, to fit\n+with their internal infrastructure and as such have some familiarity with tracing at least as the\n+SDK presents it.\n+\n+- Telemetry extension authors. Write custom SDK extensions, often to support a particular backend.\n+Verify familiar with telemetry.\n+\n+- OpenTelemetry maintainers. Write the SDK code.\n+\n+When making decisions, especially about complexity, we always prioritize the application developers,\n+then framework developers, then maintainers. This is because we expect those with less domain\n+knowledge about tracing to require a simpler experience than those with more. There is also more\n+bang-for-the-buck by making the end-user experience as streamlined as possible since we expect there\n+to be much more of them than other audiences.\n+\n+## Goals and non-goals\n+\n+### Goals\n+\n+- Provide a single entrypoint to configuring the SDK. For end-users, less familiar with the SDK, we\n+want to have everything together to provide discoverability and simpler end-user code. If there are\n+several, clear use cases which benefit from different entrypoints, we could have multiple\n+corresponding to each one.\n+\n+- Fit well with common Java idioms such as dependency injection, or common frameworks like Spring.\n+\n+- Reduce the chance of gotchas or configuration mishaps.\n+\n+- Aim for optimal performance of the configured SDK for the most common use case.\n+\n+### Non-goals\n+\n+- Provide the best possible experience for custom SDKs. Generally the burden of the experience for\n+custom SDKs can fall on their authors, we optimize for our standard usage, the full SDK. Any\n+reference to \"the SDK\" in this document refers to the full SDK with all signals.\n+\n+- Make sure everything is auto-configurable. This is out of the scope of the SDK, and instead is\n+left to auto-configuration layers, which are also described below but not as part of the core SDK. \n+In partiular, SignalProvider SPIs which currently exist are proposed to be removed from the SDK. The \n+SDK may provide an autoconfiguration extension as an option which is not internal to the main SDK \n+components.\n+\n+## Configuring an instance of the SDK\n+\n+The SDK exposes configuration options for all the signals it supports. Users all have different\n+requirements for how they use the SDK; for example they may use different exporters depending on\n+their backend. Because we cannot guess the configuration the user needs, we expect that the SDK must\n+be configured by the user before it can be used.\n+\n+Goals for configuring the SDK are\n+\n+- Discoverability of options\n+- Ease of use by end users, e.g., less complicated code required\n+- Avoid requiring duplicate configuration, which can lead to errors or confusion\n+- Provide good defaults where possible\n+\n+In Java, the builder pattern is common for configuring instances. Let's look at what that may look\n+like. The simplest configuration will be when a user wants to get a default experience, exporting\n+with a specific exporter to an endpoint.\n+\n+The SDK builder will simply allow accept its components as builder parameters. It only allows\n+setting SDK implementations and is not meant for use with partial SDKs.\n+\n+```java\n+class OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder {\n+  public OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder setTracerProvider(TracerSdkProvider tracerProvider);\n+  public OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder setMeterProvider(MeterSdkProvider meterProvider);\n+  public OpenTelemetrySdk buildAndSetAsGlobal();\n+  public OpenTelemetrySdk buildWithoutSettingAsGlobal();\n+}\n+```\n+\n+A very simple configuration may look like this.\n+\n+```java\n+class HelloWorld {\n+    public static void main(String[] args) {\n+        TracerSdkProvider tracerProvider = TracerSdkProvider.builder()\n+          .addSpanProcessor(BatchSpanProcessor.builder(OtlpGrpcSpanExporter.builder())\n+              .setEndpoint(\"spans-service:4317\")\n+              .build())\n+          .build();\n+        \n+        MeterSdkProvider meterProvider = MeterSdkProvider.builder().build();\n+        IntervalMetricReader.builder()\n+          .setMetricProducers(meterProvider.getMetricProducer())\n+          .setMetricExporter(PrometheusMetricServer.create())\n+          .build();\n+        \n+        OpenTelemetrySdk openTelemetry = OpenTelemetrySdk.builder()\n+          .addPropagator(W3CHttpTraceContextPropagator.getInstance())\n+          .setTracerProvider(tracerProvider)\n+          .setMeterProvider(meterProvider)\n+          .build();\n+   }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+This\n+\n+- Exports spans using OTLP to `spans-service`\n+  - Uses the BatchSpanProcessor.

So\n+instead, this can make it clearer that those signals themselves are full-featured, and \n+`OpenTelemetry` is just a bag of signals.\n+\n+Keep in mind, reconfiguring `Clock` is expected to be an extremely uncommon operation.\n+\n+Another thing to keep in mind is that it will be less common for an application developer to go this far\n+and we can expect it is actually framework developers that use the full configuration capabilities\n+of the SDK, likely by tying it to a separate configuration system.\n+\n+### Why build instances\n+\n+We have found that even at such an early stage of user adoption, users want to build instances of\n+the SDK.\n+\n+- Integrates with dependency injection, e.g., Spring, in a similar way as many other libraries\n+- Can allow having multiple instances in the same app, in multi-concern single-classloader scenarios\n+- Allow managing lifecycle of SDK, e.g., shutting down and starting along with the lifecycle of a\n+serverless runtime\n+\n+### Configuring the SDK in a framework\n+\n+It is extremely common for Java apps to be written using a dependency injection framework like\n+Spring, Guice, Dagger, HK, and many more.

Because it\n+has a easy-to-reason initialization ordering, being tied into the dependency ordering (even if dependency \n+injection happened to be done manually through constructor invocation), we encourage application\n+developers to only use it.\n+\n+However, there are corner cases where an instance cannot be injected. The famous example is MySQL -\n+MySQL interceptors are initialized by calling a default constructor, and there is no way to pass a\n+built instance of a signal provider. For this case, we must store an SDK instance into a global\n+variable. It is expected that frameworks or end-users will set the SDK as the global to support\n+instrumentation that requires this.\n+\n+Before an SDK has been set, access to the global `OpenTelemetry` will return a no-op \n+`DefaultOpenTelemetry`. This is because it is possible library instrumentation is using the global,\n+and it may even use it during the processing of a request (rather than only at initialization time).\n+For this reason, we cannot throw an exception. Instead, if the SDK is detected on the classpath, we\n+will log a `SEVERE` warning once-only indicating the API has been accessed before the SDK configured\n+with directions on how a user could solve the problem. SDKs must be configured early\n+in an application to ensure it applies to all of the logic in the app, and this will generally be\n+ensured by the configuration framework such as Spring. For application developers, this restriction\n+should not have any effect one way or the other in the vast majority of cases.\n+\n+MySQL is the only known corner case that requires the global SDK instance. If such a corner case\n+didn't exist, we may not even support it in the first place.\n+\n+See special note about Java Agent below though.\n+\n+## Telemetry within SDK components\n+\n+SDK components, such as exporters or remote samplers, may want to emit telemetry for their own\n+processing.

It is a\n+continuation of discussion started with https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/issues/2022.\n+\n+## Target audiences\n+\n+There are a few different target audiences that are related to our configuration story.\n+\n+- Application developers, aka end-users. Often have no knowledge of tracing but want to add \n+OpenTelemetry to their app and see traces show up in a console. Application developers will increase\n+in number forever, while the below are more constant.\n+\n+- Dev-ops / framework developers. Write components or frameworks to support providing tracing to\n+their application developers. May write custom SDK extensions such as exporters, samplers, to fit\n+with their internal infrastructure and as such have some familiarity with tracing at least as the\n+SDK presents it.\n+\n+- Telemetry extension authors. Write custom SDK extensions, often to support a particular backend.\n+Verify familiar with telemetry.\n+\n+- OpenTelemetry maintainers. Write the SDK code.\n+\n+When making decisions, especially about complexity, we always prioritize the application developers,\n+then framework developers, then maintainers. This is because we expect those with less domain\n+knowledge about tracing to require a simpler experience than those with more. There is also more\n+bang-for-the-buck by making the end-user experience as streamlined as possible since we expect there\n+to be much more of them than other audiences.\n+\n+## Goals and non-goals\n+\n+### Goals\n+\n+- Provide a single entrypoint to configuring the SDK. For end-users, less familiar with the SDK, we\n+want to have everything together to provide discoverability and simpler end-user code. If there are\n+several, clear use cases which benefit from different entrypoints, we could have multiple\n+corresponding to each one.\n+\n+- Fit well with common Java idioms such as dependency injection, or common frameworks like Spring.\n+\n+- Reduce the chance of gotchas or configuration mishaps.\n+\n+- Aim for optimal performance of the configured SDK for the most common use case.\n+\n+### Non-goals\n+\n+- Provide the best possible experience for custom SDKs. Generally the burden of the experience for\n+custom SDKs can fall on their authors, we optimize for our standard usage, the full SDK. Any\n+reference to \"the SDK\" in this document refers to the full SDK with all signals.\n+\n+- Make sure everything is auto-configurable. This is out of the scope of the SDK, and instead is\n+left to auto-configuration layers, which are also described below but not as part of the core SDK. \n+In partiular, SignalProvider SPIs which currently exist are proposed to be removed from the SDK. The \n+SDK may provide an autoconfiguration extension as an option which is not internal to the main SDK \n+components.\n+\n+## Configuring an instance of the SDK\n+\n+The SDK exposes configuration options for all the signals it supports. Users all have different\n+requirements for how they use the SDK; for example they may use different exporters depending on\n+their backend. Because we cannot guess the configuration the user needs, we expect that the SDK must\n+be configured by the user before it can be used.\n+\n+Goals for configuring the SDK are\n+\n+- Discoverability of options\n+- Ease of use by end users, e.g., less complicated code required\n+- Avoid requiring duplicate configuration, which can lead to errors or confusion\n+- Provide good defaults where possible\n+\n+In Java, the builder pattern is common for configuring instances. Let's look at what that may look\n+like. The simplest configuration will be when a user wants to get a default experience, exporting\n+with a specific exporter to an endpoint.\n+\n+The SDK builder will simply allow accept its components as builder parameters. It only allows\n+setting SDK implementations and is not meant for use with partial SDKs.\n+\n+```java\n+class OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder {\n+  public OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder setTracerProvider(TracerSdkProvider tracerProvider);\n+  public OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder setMeterProvider(MeterSdkProvider meterProvider);\n+  public OpenTelemetrySdk buildAndSetAsGlobal();\n+  public OpenTelemetrySdk buildWithoutSettingAsGlobal();\n+}\n+```\n+\n+A very simple configuration may look like this.\n+\n+```java\n+class HelloWorld {\n+    public static void main(String[] args) {\n+        TracerSdkProvider tracerProvider = TracerSdkProvider.builder()\n+          .addSpanProcessor(BatchSpanProcessor.builder(OtlpGrpcSpanExporter.builder())\n+              .setEndpoint(\"spans-service:4317\")\n+              .build())\n+          .build();\n+        \n+        MeterSdkProvider meterProvider = MeterSdkProvider.builder().build();\n+        IntervalMetricReader.builder()\n+          .setMetricProducers(meterProvider.getMetricProducer())\n+          .setMetricExporter(PrometheusMetricServer.create())\n+          .build();\n+        \n+        OpenTelemetrySdk openTelemetry = OpenTelemetrySdk.builder()\n+          .addPropagator(W3CHttpTraceContextPropagator.getInstance())\n+          .setTracerProvider(tracerProvider)\n+          .setMeterProvider(meterProvider)\n+          .build();\n+   }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+This\n+\n+- Exports spans using OTLP to `spans-service`\n+  - Uses the BatchSpanProcessor.

We unfortunately cannot achieve our goal of only\n+setting a property once - `Resource` and `Clock` are shared among signals but configured repeatedly.\n+An alternative is to flatten all settings onto `OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder` - this has a downside that\n+it makes it very natural to create new tracer / meter providers for each configuration of the SDK,\n+which could result in a lot of duplication of resources like threads, workers, TCP connections. So\n+instead, this can make it clearer that those signals themselves are full-featured, and \n+`OpenTelemetry` is just a bag of signals.\n+\n+Keep in mind, reconfiguring `Clock` is expected to be an extremely uncommon operation.\n+\n+Another thing to keep in mind is that it will be less common for an application developer to go this far\n+and we can expect it is actually framework developers that use the full configuration capabilities\n+of the SDK, likely by tying it to a separate configuration system.\n+\n+### Why build instances\n+\n+We have found that even at such an early stage of user adoption, users want to build instances of\n+the SDK.\n+\n+- Integrates with dependency injection, e.g., Spring, in a similar way as many other libraries\n+- Can allow having multiple instances in the same app, in multi-concern single-classloader scenarios\n+- Allow managing lifecycle of SDK, e.g., shutting down and starting along with the lifecycle of a\n+serverless runtime\n+\n+### Configuring the SDK in a framework\n+\n+It is extremely common for Java apps to be written using a dependency injection framework like\n+Spring, Guice, Dagger, HK, and many more.

Because it\n+has a easy-to-reason initialization ordering, being tied into the dependency ordering (even if dependency \n+injection happened to be done manually through constructor invocation), we encourage application\n+developers to only use it.\n+\n+However, there are corner cases where an instance cannot be injected. The famous example is MySQL -\n+MySQL interceptors are initialized by calling a default constructor, and there is no way to pass a\n+built instance of a signal provider. For this case, we must store an SDK instance into a global\n+variable. It is expected that frameworks or end-users will set the SDK as the global to support\n+instrumentation that requires this.\n+\n+Before an SDK has been set, access to the global `OpenTelemetry` will return a no-op \n+`DefaultOpenTelemetry`. This is because it is possible library instrumentation is using the global,\n+and it may even use it during the processing of a request (rather than only at initialization time).\n+For this reason, we cannot throw an exception. Instead, if the SDK is detected on the classpath, we\n+will log a `SEVERE` warning once-only indicating the API has been accessed before the SDK configured\n+with directions on how a user could solve the problem. SDKs must be configured early\n+in an application to ensure it applies to all of the logic in the app, and this will generally be\n+ensured by the configuration framework such as Spring. For application developers, this restriction\n+should not have any effect one way or the other in the vast majority of cases.\n+\n+MySQL is the only known corner case that requires the global SDK instance. If such a corner case\n+didn't exist, we may not even support it in the first place.\n+\n+See special note about Java Agent below though.\n+\n+## Telemetry within SDK components\n+\n+SDK components, such as exporters or remote samplers, may want to emit telemetry for their own\n+processing. However, the SDK components must be initialized before the SDK can be fully built. We do\n+not support partially built SDK because one cannot reason about the behavior of it. Similarly we\n+do not support using the global instance of the SDK before it has been built. Therefore, SDK\n+components that require `OpenTelemetry` must accept it lazily.

It is a\n+continuation of discussion started with https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/issues/2022.\n+\n+## Target audiences\n+\n+There are a few different target audiences that are related to our configuration story.\n+\n+- Application developers, aka end-users. Often have no knowledge of tracing but want to add \n+OpenTelemetry to their app and see traces show up in a console. Application developers will increase\n+in number forever, while the below are more constant.\n+\n+- Dev-ops / framework developers. Write components or frameworks to support providing tracing to\n+their application developers. May write custom SDK extensions such as exporters, samplers, to fit\n+with their internal infrastructure and as such have some familiarity with tracing at least as the\n+SDK presents it.\n+\n+- Telemetry extension authors. Write custom SDK extensions, often to support a particular backend.\n+Verify familiar with telemetry.\n+\n+- OpenTelemetry maintainers. Write the SDK code.\n+\n+When making decisions, especially about complexity, we always prioritize the application developers,\n+then framework developers, then maintainers. This is because we expect those with less domain\n+knowledge about tracing to require a simpler experience than those with more. There is also more\n+bang-for-the-buck by making the end-user experience as streamlined as possible since we expect there\n+to be much more of them than other audiences.\n+\n+## Goals and non-goals\n+\n+### Goals\n+\n+- Provide a single entrypoint to configuring the SDK. For end-users, less familiar with the SDK, we\n+want to have everything together to provide discoverability and simpler end-user code. If there are\n+several, clear use cases which benefit from different entrypoints, we could have multiple\n+corresponding to each one.\n+\n+- Fit well with common Java idioms such as dependency injection, or common frameworks like Spring.\n+\n+- Reduce the chance of gotchas or configuration mishaps.\n+\n+- Aim for optimal performance of the configured SDK for the most common use case.\n+\n+### Non-goals\n+\n+- Provide the best possible experience for custom SDKs. Generally the burden of the experience for\n+custom SDKs can fall on their authors, we optimize for our standard usage, the full SDK. Any\n+reference to \"the SDK\" in this document refers to the full SDK with all signals.\n+\n+- Make sure everything is auto-configurable. This is out of the scope of the SDK, and instead is\n+left to auto-configuration layers, which are also described below but not as part of the core SDK. \n+In partiular, SignalProvider SPIs which currently exist are proposed to be removed from the SDK. The \n+SDK may provide an autoconfiguration extension as an option which is not internal to the main SDK \n+components.\n+\n+## Configuring an instance of the SDK\n+\n+The SDK exposes configuration options for all the signals it supports. Users all have different\n+requirements for how they use the SDK; for example they may use different exporters depending on\n+their backend. Because we cannot guess the configuration the user needs, we expect that the SDK must\n+be configured by the user before it can be used.\n+\n+Goals for configuring the SDK are\n+\n+- Discoverability of options\n+- Ease of use by end users, e.g., less complicated code required\n+- Avoid requiring duplicate configuration, which can lead to errors or confusion\n+- Provide good defaults where possible\n+\n+In Java, the builder pattern is common for configuring instances. Let's look at what that may look\n+like. The simplest configuration will be when a user wants to get a default experience, exporting\n+with a specific exporter to an endpoint.\n+\n+The SDK builder will simply allow accept its components as builder parameters. It only allows\n+setting SDK implementations and is not meant for use with partial SDKs.\n+\n+```java\n+class OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder {\n+  public OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder setTracerProvider(TracerSdkProvider tracerProvider);\n+  public OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder setMeterProvider(MeterSdkProvider meterProvider);\n+  public OpenTelemetrySdk buildAndSetAsGlobal();\n+  public OpenTelemetrySdk buildWithoutSettingAsGlobal();\n+}\n+```\n+\n+A very simple configuration may look like this.\n+\n+```java\n+class HelloWorld {\n+    public static void main(String[] args) {\n+        TracerSdkProvider tracerProvider = TracerSdkProvider.builder()\n+          .addSpanProcessor(BatchSpanProcessor.builder(OtlpGrpcSpanExporter.builder())\n+              .setEndpoint(\"spans-service:4317\")\n+              .build())\n+          .build();\n+        \n+        MeterSdkProvider meterProvider = MeterSdkProvider.builder().build();\n+        IntervalMetricReader.builder()\n+          .setMetricProducers(meterProvider.getMetricProducer())\n+          .setMetricExporter(PrometheusMetricServer.create())\n+          .build();\n+        \n+        OpenTelemetrySdk openTelemetry = OpenTelemetrySdk.builder()\n+          .addPropagator(W3CHttpTraceContextPropagator.getInstance())\n+          .setTracerProvider(tracerProvider)\n+          .setMeterProvider(meterProvider)\n+          .build();\n+   }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+This\n+\n+- Exports spans using OTLP to `spans-service`\n+  - Uses the BatchSpanProcessor.

We unfortunately cannot achieve our goal of only\n+setting a property once - `Resource` and `Clock` are shared among signals but configured repeatedly.\n+An alternative is to flatten all settings onto `OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder` - this has a downside that\n+it makes it very natural to create new tracer / meter providers for each configuration of the SDK,\n+which could result in a lot of duplication of resources like threads, workers, TCP connections. So\n+instead, this can make it clearer that those signals themselves are full-featured, and \n+`OpenTelemetry` is just a bag of signals.\n+\n+Keep in mind, reconfiguring `Clock` is expected to be an extremely uncommon operation.\n+\n+Another thing to keep in mind is that it will be less common for an application developer to go this far\n+and we can expect it is actually framework developers that use the full configuration capabilities\n+of the SDK, likely by tying it to a separate configuration system.\n+\n+### Why build instances\n+\n+We have found that even at such an early stage of user adoption, users want to build instances of\n+the SDK.\n+\n+- Integrates with dependency injection, e.g., Spring, in a similar way as many other libraries\n+- Can allow having multiple instances in the same app, in multi-concern single-classloader scenarios\n+- Allow managing lifecycle of SDK, e.g., shutting down and starting along with the lifecycle of a\n+serverless runtime\n+\n+### Configuring the SDK in a framework\n+\n+It is extremely common for Java apps to be written using a dependency injection framework like\n+Spring, Guice, Dagger, HK, and many more.

Because it\n+has a easy-to-reason initialization ordering, being tied into the dependency ordering (even if dependency \n+injection happened to be done manually through constructor invocation), we encourage application\n+developers to only use it.\n+\n+However, there are corner cases where an instance cannot be injected. The famous example is MySQL -\n+MySQL interceptors are initialized by calling a default constructor, and there is no way to pass a\n+built instance of a signal provider. For this case, we must store an SDK instance into a global\n+variable. It is expected that frameworks or end-users will set the SDK as the global to support\n+instrumentation that requires this.\n+\n+Before an SDK has been set, access to the global `OpenTelemetry` will return a no-op \n+`DefaultOpenTelemetry`. This is because it is possible library instrumentation is using the global,\n+and it may even use it during the processing of a request (rather than only at initialization time).\n+For this reason, we cannot throw an exception. Instead, if the SDK is detected on the classpath, we\n+will log a `SEVERE` warning once-only indicating the API has been accessed before the SDK configured\n+with directions on how a user could solve the problem. SDKs must be configured early\n+in an application to ensure it applies to all of the logic in the app, and this will generally be\n+ensured by the configuration framework such as Spring. For application developers, this restriction\n+should not have any effect one way or the other in the vast majority of cases.\n+\n+MySQL is the only known corner case that requires the global SDK instance. If such a corner case\n+didn't exist, we may not even support it in the first place.\n+\n+See special note about Java Agent below though.\n+\n+## Telemetry within SDK components\n+\n+SDK components, such as exporters or remote samplers, may want to emit telemetry for their own\n+processing. However, the SDK components must be initialized before the SDK can be fully built. We do\n+not support partially built SDK because one cannot reason about the behavior of it. Similarly we\n+do not support using the global instance of the SDK before it has been built. Therefore, SDK\n+components that require `OpenTelemetry` must accept it lazily. This is a restriction, but given\n+such components are rarely developed by application developers, and generally developed by either\n+framework authors or OpenTelemetry maintainers, this restriction is deemed reasonable.\n+\n+If this mechanism was built into the SDK, it may look like\n+\n+```java\n+interface OpenTelemetryComponent {\n+  default void setOpenTelemetry(OpenTelemetry openTelemetry) {}\n+}\n+interface SpanExporter extends OpenTelemetryComponent {\n+}\n+public class BatchExporter implements SpanExporter {\n+  \n+  private volatile Tracer tracer;\n+  \n+  @Override\n+  public void setOpenTelemetry(OpenTelemetry openTelemetry) {\n+        tracer = openTelemetry.getTracerProvider().get(\"spanexporter\");\n+  }\n+  \n+  @Override\n+  public void export() {\n+        Tracer tracer = this.tracer;\n+        if (tracer != null) {\n+          tracer.spanBuilder(\"export\").startSpan();\n+        }\n+  }\n+}\n+public class OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder {\n+    public OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder addSpanExporter(SpanExporter exporter) {\n+        tracerProvider.addSpanExporter(exporter);\n+        components.add(exporter);\n+    }\n+    \n+    public OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder setSampler(Sampler sampler) {\n+        tracerProvider.setSampler(sampler);\n+        components.add(sampler);\n+    }\n+    \n+    public OpenTelemetry build() {\n+        OpenTelemetrySdk sdk = new OpenTelemetrySdk(tracerProvider.build(), meterProvider.build());\n+        for (OpenTelemetryComponent component : components) {\n+          component.setOpenTelemetry(sdk);\n+        }\n+    }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+A framework author will have an even easier time since most dependency injection frameworks\n+natively support lazy injection.\n+\n+```java\n+@Component\n+public class MonitoringModule {\n+  \n+    @Bean\n+    @ForSpanExporter\n+    public Tracer tracer(TracerProvider tracerProvider) {\n+    return tracerProvider.get(\"spanexporter\");\n+    }\n+}\n+\n+@Component\n+public class MyExporter implements SpanExporter {\n+\n+    private Lazy<Tracer> tracer;\n+    \n+    @Inject\n+    public MyExporter(@ForSpanExporter Lazy<Tracer> tracer) {\n+    this.tracer = tracer;\n+    }\n+    \n+    @Override\n+    public void export() {\n+    tracer.get().spanBuilder(\"export\").startSpan();\n+    }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+## Immutability of OpenTelemetry configuration\n+\n+The above attempts to avoid allowing a built SDK to be mutated. Allowing mutation can make code\n+harder to reason about (any component, even deep in business logic, could update the SDK without\n+hindrance), can reduce performance (require volatile read on most operations), and produce thread\n+safety issues if not well implemented. In particular, compared to the current state as of writing,\n+\n+- `addSpanProcessor` is not needed because we instead push the complexity of handling telemetry\n+within telemetry components to those components, where the maintainers will have more domain\n+knowledge. It allows this mutator method to be removed from the end-user API.\n+\n+- `updateTraceConfig` - instead of allowing updates at the top level, we should consider making\n+`TraceConfig` an interface, and the SDK default implementation is static. It allows the above\n+benefits of immutability to be in place for the common case where dynamic updates are not needed.\n+Where dynamic updates are needed, it can be replaced with a mutable implementation instead of making\n+the SDK configuration mutable. This keeps update methods out of the end-user APIs and will generally\n+give framework developers more control by handling dynamicism themselves without the chance of\n+end-users to affect it negatively.\n+\n+Some highly buggy code that could be enabled by mutability.\n+\n+```java\n+class SleuthUsingService {\n+  \n+  @Inject\n+  private OpenTelemetry openTelemetry;\n+\n+  public void doLogic() {\n+    // My logic is important, so always sample it!\n+    OpenTelemetrySdk.getTracerManagement().updateTraceConfig(config -> config.setSampler(ALWAYS_ON));\n+    // This service was able to affect other services, even though Sleuth intends to\n+    // \"manage the SDK\".

It seems\n+reasonable to actually remove `shutdown` from the `TracerSdkProvider` - the SDK provider is mostly\n+a bag of parts and has no intrinsic component, if instead components like `BatchSpanProcessor` and\n+`SpanExporter` implement `Closeable`, we can model shutdown as the responsibility of the creator of\n+the resources, which is idiomatic. In DI frameworks, this would generally be automatic. This would\n+prevent the case where two `TracerProvider` share an exporter and one of them is shutdown - when\n+shutting down the exporter, shut down the exporter.\n+\n+```java\n+public class MyApp {\n+ \n+    public static void main(String[] args) {\n+        try (OtlpGrpcSpanExporter otlpExporter = OtlpGrpcSpanExporter.builder().build();\n+              BatchSpanProcessor otlpProcessor = BatchSpanProcessor.builder(otlpExporter).build()) {\n+            OpenTelemetrySdk sdk = OpenTelemetrySdk.builder()\n+                .setTracerProvider(TracerSdkProvider.builder()\n+                                        .addSpanProcessor(otlpProcessor)\n+                                        .build())\n+                .build();\n+ \n+            Server server = Server.builder().setOpenTelemetry(sdk).build();\n+            server.listenAndServe();\n+        }\n+    }\n+\n+}\n+```\n+\n+```java\n+@Component\n+public class MyModule {\n+\n+    @Bean\n+    // If SpanExporter extends Closeable, it's automatically closed\n+    OtlpGrpcSpanExporter otlpExporter() {\n+        return OtlpGrpcSpanExporter.builder().build()\n+    }\n+   \n+    @Bean\n+    // If BatchSpanProcessor extends Closeable, it's automatically closed\n+    BatchSpanProcessor otlpSpanProcessor(OtlpGrpcSpanExporter otlpExporter) {\n+        return BatchSpanProcessor.builder(otlpExporter).build();\n+    }\n+ \n+    @Bean\n+    TracerSdkProvider tracerProvider(BatchSpanProcessor otlpSpanProcessor) {\n+        return TracerSdkProvider.builder().addSpanProcessor(otlpSpanProcessor).build();\n+    }\n+\n+    @Bean\n+    OpenTelemetrySdk openTelemetry(TracerSdkProvider tracerProvider) {\n+        return OpenTelemetrySdk.builder().setTracerProvider(tracerProvider).build();\n+    }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+The `OpenTelemetrySdk` and `TracerSdkProvider` are still exposed to provide access to `forceFlush`.\n+This makes it seem like `forceFlush`, though implemented in the SDK, may be more appropriate for the\n+API as it's an end-user API - it could make the separation of concerns of the initialization of the\n+SDK and the end-user tracing API complete.

It is a\n+continuation of discussion started with https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/issues/2022.\n+\n+## Target audiences\n+\n+There are a few different target audiences that are related to our configuration story.\n+\n+- Application developers, aka end-users. Often have no knowledge of tracing but want to add \n+OpenTelemetry to their app and see traces show up in a console. Application developers will increase\n+in number forever, while the below are more constant.\n+\n+- Dev-ops / framework developers. Write components or frameworks to support providing tracing to\n+their application developers. May write custom SDK extensions such as exporters, samplers, to fit\n+with their internal infrastructure and as such have some familiarity with tracing at least as the\n+SDK presents it.\n+\n+- Telemetry extension authors. Write custom SDK extensions, often to support a particular backend.\n+Verify familiar with telemetry.\n+\n+- OpenTelemetry maintainers. Write the SDK code.\n+\n+When making decisions, especially about complexity, we always prioritize the application developers,\n+then framework developers, then maintainers. This is because we expect those with less domain\n+knowledge about tracing to require a simpler experience than those with more. There is also more\n+bang-for-the-buck by making the end-user experience as streamlined as possible since we expect there\n+to be much more of them than other audiences.\n+\n+## Goals and non-goals\n+\n+### Goals\n+\n+- Provide a single entrypoint to configuring the SDK. For end-users, less familiar with the SDK, we\n+want to have everything together to provide discoverability and simpler end-user code. If there are\n+several, clear use cases which benefit from different entrypoints, we could have multiple\n+corresponding to each one.\n+\n+- Fit well with common Java idioms such as dependency injection, or common frameworks like Spring.\n+\n+- Reduce the chance of gotchas or configuration mishaps.\n+\n+- Aim for optimal performance of the configured SDK for the most common use case.\n+\n+### Non-goals\n+\n+- Provide the best possible experience for custom SDKs. Generally the burden of the experience for\n+custom SDKs can fall on their authors, we optimize for our standard usage, the full SDK. Any\n+reference to \"the SDK\" in this document refers to the full SDK with all signals.\n+\n+- Make sure everything is auto-configurable. This is out of the scope of the SDK, and instead is\n+left to auto-configuration layers, which are also described below but not as part of the core SDK. \n+In partiular, SignalProvider SPIs which currently exist are proposed to be removed from the SDK. The \n+SDK may provide an autoconfiguration extension as an option which is not internal to the main SDK \n+components.\n+\n+## Configuring an instance of the SDK\n+\n+The SDK exposes configuration options for all the signals it supports. Users all have different\n+requirements for how they use the SDK; for example they may use different exporters depending on\n+their backend. Because we cannot guess the configuration the user needs, we expect that the SDK must\n+be configured by the user before it can be used.\n+\n+Goals for configuring the SDK are\n+\n+- Discoverability of options\n+- Ease of use by end users, e.g., less complicated code required\n+- Avoid requiring duplicate configuration, which can lead to errors or confusion\n+- Provide good defaults where possible\n+\n+In Java, the builder pattern is common for configuring instances. Let's look at what that may look\n+like. The simplest configuration will be when a user wants to get a default experience, exporting\n+with a specific exporter to an endpoint.\n+\n+The SDK builder will simply allow accept its components as builder parameters. It only allows\n+setting SDK implementations and is not meant for use with partial SDKs.\n+\n+```java\n+class OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder {\n+  public OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder setTracerProvider(TracerSdkProvider tracerProvider);\n+  public OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder setMeterProvider(MeterSdkProvider meterProvider);\n+  public OpenTelemetrySdk buildAndSetAsGlobal();\n+  public OpenTelemetrySdk buildWithoutSettingAsGlobal();\n+}\n+```\n+\n+A very simple configuration may look like this.\n+\n+```java\n+class HelloWorld {\n+    public static void main(String[] args) {\n+        TracerSdkProvider tracerProvider = TracerSdkProvider.builder()\n+          .addSpanProcessor(BatchSpanProcessor.builder(OtlpGrpcSpanExporter.builder())\n+              .setEndpoint(\"spans-service:4317\")\n+              .build())\n+          .build();\n+        \n+        MeterSdkProvider meterProvider = MeterSdkProvider.builder().build();\n+        IntervalMetricReader.builder()\n+          .setMetricProducers(meterProvider.getMetricProducer())\n+          .setMetricExporter(PrometheusMetricServer.create())\n+          .build();\n+        \n+        OpenTelemetrySdk openTelemetry = OpenTelemetrySdk.builder()\n+          .addPropagator(W3CHttpTraceContextPropagator.getInstance())\n+          .setTracerProvider(tracerProvider)\n+          .setMeterProvider(meterProvider)\n+          .build();\n+   }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+This\n+\n+- Exports spans using OTLP to `spans-service`\n+  - Uses the BatchSpanProcessor.

We unfortunately cannot achieve our goal of only\n+setting a property once - `Resource` and `Clock` are shared among signals but configured repeatedly.\n+An alternative is to flatten all settings onto `OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder` - this has a downside that\n+it makes it very natural to create new tracer / meter providers for each configuration of the SDK,\n+which could result in a lot of duplication of resources like threads, workers, TCP connections. So\n+instead, this can make it clearer that those signals themselves are full-featured, and \n+`OpenTelemetry` is just a bag of signals.\n+\n+Keep in mind, reconfiguring `Clock` is expected to be an extremely uncommon operation.\n+\n+Another thing to keep in mind is that it will be less common for an application developer to go this far\n+and we can expect it is actually framework developers that use the full configuration capabilities\n+of the SDK, likely by tying it to a separate configuration system.\n+\n+### Why build instances\n+\n+We have found that even at such an early stage of user adoption, users want to build instances of\n+the SDK.\n+\n+- Integrates with dependency injection, e.g., Spring, in a similar way as many other libraries\n+- Can allow having multiple instances in the same app, in multi-concern single-classloader scenarios\n+- Allow managing lifecycle of SDK, e.g., shutting down and starting along with the lifecycle of a\n+serverless runtime\n+\n+### Configuring the SDK in a framework\n+\n+It is extremely common for Java apps to be written using a dependency injection framework like\n+Spring, Guice, Dagger, HK, and many more.

Because it\n+has a easy-to-reason initialization ordering, being tied into the dependency ordering (even if dependency \n+injection happened to be done manually through constructor invocation), we encourage application\n+developers to only use it.\n+\n+However, there are corner cases where an instance cannot be injected. The famous example is MySQL -\n+MySQL interceptors are initialized by calling a default constructor, and there is no way to pass a\n+built instance of a signal provider. For this case, we must store an SDK instance into a global\n+variable. It is expected that frameworks or end-users will set the SDK as the global to support\n+instrumentation that requires this.\n+\n+Before an SDK has been set, access to the global `OpenTelemetry` will return a no-op \n+`DefaultOpenTelemetry`. This is because it is possible library instrumentation is using the global,\n+and it may even use it during the processing of a request (rather than only at initialization time).\n+For this reason, we cannot throw an exception. Instead, if the SDK is detected on the classpath, we\n+will log a `SEVERE` warning once-only indicating the API has been accessed before the SDK configured\n+with directions on how a user could solve the problem. SDKs must be configured early\n+in an application to ensure it applies to all of the logic in the app, and this will generally be\n+ensured by the configuration framework such as Spring. For application developers, this restriction\n+should not have any effect one way or the other in the vast majority of cases.\n+\n+MySQL is the only known corner case that requires the global SDK instance. If such a corner case\n+didn't exist, we may not even support it in the first place.\n+\n+See special note about Java Agent below though.\n+\n+## Telemetry within SDK components\n+\n+SDK components, such as exporters or remote samplers, may want to emit telemetry for their own\n+processing. However, the SDK components must be initialized before the SDK can be fully built. We do\n+not support partially built SDK because one cannot reason about the behavior of it. Similarly we\n+do not support using the global instance of the SDK before it has been built. Therefore, SDK\n+components that require `OpenTelemetry` must accept it lazily. This is a restriction, but given\n+such components are rarely developed by application developers, and generally developed by either\n+framework authors or OpenTelemetry maintainers, this restriction is deemed reasonable.\n+\n+If this mechanism was built into the SDK, it may look like\n+\n+```java\n+interface OpenTelemetryComponent {\n+  default void setOpenTelemetry(OpenTelemetry openTelemetry) {}\n+}\n+interface SpanExporter extends OpenTelemetryComponent {\n+}\n+public class BatchExporter implements SpanExporter {\n+  \n+  private volatile Tracer tracer;\n+  \n+  @Override\n+  public void setOpenTelemetry(OpenTelemetry openTelemetry) {\n+        tracer = openTelemetry.getTracerProvider().get(\"spanexporter\");\n+  }\n+  \n+  @Override\n+  public void export() {\n+        Tracer tracer = this.tracer;\n+        if (tracer != null) {\n+          tracer.spanBuilder(\"export\").startSpan();\n+        }\n+  }\n+}\n+public class OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder {\n+    public OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder addSpanExporter(SpanExporter exporter) {\n+        tracerProvider.addSpanExporter(exporter);\n+        components.add(exporter);\n+    }\n+    \n+    public OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder setSampler(Sampler sampler) {\n+        tracerProvider.setSampler(sampler);\n+        components.add(sampler);\n+    }\n+    \n+    public OpenTelemetry build() {\n+        OpenTelemetrySdk sdk = new OpenTelemetrySdk(tracerProvider.build(), meterProvider.build());\n+        for (OpenTelemetryComponent component : components) {\n+          component.setOpenTelemetry(sdk);\n+        }\n+    }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+A framework author will have an even easier time since most dependency injection frameworks\n+natively support lazy injection.\n+\n+```java\n+@Component\n+public class MonitoringModule {\n+  \n+    @Bean\n+    @ForSpanExporter\n+    public Tracer tracer(TracerProvider tracerProvider) {\n+    return tracerProvider.get(\"spanexporter\");\n+    }\n+}\n+\n+@Component\n+public class MyExporter implements SpanExporter {\n+\n+    private Lazy<Tracer> tracer;\n+    \n+    @Inject\n+    public MyExporter(@ForSpanExporter Lazy<Tracer> tracer) {\n+    this.tracer = tracer;\n+    }\n+    \n+    @Override\n+    public void export() {\n+    tracer.get().spanBuilder(\"export\").startSpan();\n+    }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+## Immutability of OpenTelemetry configuration\n+\n+The above attempts to avoid allowing a built SDK to be mutated. Allowing mutation can make code\n+harder to reason about (any component, even deep in business logic, could update the SDK without\n+hindrance), can reduce performance (require volatile read on most operations), and produce thread\n+safety issues if not well implemented. In particular, compared to the current state as of writing,\n+\n+- `addSpanProcessor` is not needed because we instead push the complexity of handling telemetry\n+within telemetry components to those components, where the maintainers will have more domain\n+knowledge. It allows this mutator method to be removed from the end-user API.\n+\n+- `updateTraceConfig` - instead of allowing updates at the top level, we should consider making\n+`TraceConfig` an interface, and the SDK default implementation is static. It allows the above\n+benefits of immutability to be in place for the common case where dynamic updates are not needed.\n+Where dynamic updates are needed, it can be replaced with a mutable implementation instead of making\n+the SDK configuration mutable. This keeps update methods out of the end-user APIs and will generally\n+give framework developers more control by handling dynamicism themselves without the chance of\n+end-users to affect it negatively.\n+\n+Some highly buggy code that could be enabled by mutability.\n+\n+```java\n+class SleuthUsingService {\n+  \n+  @Inject\n+  private OpenTelemetry openTelemetry;\n+\n+  public void doLogic() {\n+    // My logic is important, so always sample it!\n+    OpenTelemetrySdk.getTracerManagement().updateTraceConfig(config -> config.setSampler(ALWAYS_ON));\n+    // This service was able to affect other services, even though Sleuth intends to\n+    // \"manage the SDK\".

It seems\n+reasonable to actually remove `shutdown` from the `TracerSdkProvider` - the SDK provider is mostly\n+a bag of parts and has no intrinsic component, if instead components like `BatchSpanProcessor` and\n+`SpanExporter` implement `Closeable`, we can model shutdown as the responsibility of the creator of\n+the resources, which is idiomatic. In DI frameworks, this would generally be automatic. This would\n+prevent the case where two `TracerProvider` share an exporter and one of them is shutdown - when\n+shutting down the exporter, shut down the exporter.\n+\n+```java\n+public class MyApp {\n+ \n+    public static void main(String[] args) {\n+        try (OtlpGrpcSpanExporter otlpExporter = OtlpGrpcSpanExporter.builder().build();\n+              BatchSpanProcessor otlpProcessor = BatchSpanProcessor.builder(otlpExporter).build()) {\n+            OpenTelemetrySdk sdk = OpenTelemetrySdk.builder()\n+                .setTracerProvider(TracerSdkProvider.builder()\n+                                        .addSpanProcessor(otlpProcessor)\n+                                        .build())\n+                .build();\n+ \n+            Server server = Server.builder().setOpenTelemetry(sdk).build();\n+            server.listenAndServe();\n+        }\n+    }\n+\n+}\n+```\n+\n+```java\n+@Component\n+public class MyModule {\n+\n+    @Bean\n+    // If SpanExporter extends Closeable, it's automatically closed\n+    OtlpGrpcSpanExporter otlpExporter() {\n+        return OtlpGrpcSpanExporter.builder().build()\n+    }\n+   \n+    @Bean\n+    // If BatchSpanProcessor extends Closeable, it's automatically closed\n+    BatchSpanProcessor otlpSpanProcessor(OtlpGrpcSpanExporter otlpExporter) {\n+        return BatchSpanProcessor.builder(otlpExporter).build();\n+    }\n+ \n+    @Bean\n+    TracerSdkProvider tracerProvider(BatchSpanProcessor otlpSpanProcessor) {\n+        return TracerSdkProvider.builder().addSpanProcessor(otlpSpanProcessor).build();\n+    }\n+\n+    @Bean\n+    OpenTelemetrySdk openTelemetry(TracerSdkProvider tracerProvider) {\n+        return OpenTelemetrySdk.builder().setTracerProvider(tracerProvider).build();\n+    }\n+}\n+```\n+\n+The `OpenTelemetrySdk` and `TracerSdkProvider` are still exposed to provide access to `forceFlush`.\n+This makes it seem like `forceFlush`, though implemented in the SDK, may be more appropriate for the\n+API as it's an end-user API - it could make the separation of concerns of the initialization of the\n+SDK and the end-user tracing API complete. But the spec currently does not allow it.\n+\n+## Library instrumentation\n+\n+As the configuration of observability is contained on `OpenTelemetry` instances, it is expected that\n+library instrumentation accept an `OpenTelemetry` instance, often as a builder for their e.g.,\n+tracing interceptor, when configuring observability. An alternative method that leaves out the\n+parameter and falls back to the global can be added as well. Library authors would still have the\n+choice of starting with using the global and adding configurability by accepting `OpenTelemetry` if\n+users request it - we would expect official `OpenTelemetry` maintained library instrumentation to\n+follow our pattern though.\n+\n+## Auto-configuration\n+\n+The above presents programmatic configuration for the SDK and proposes that the core SDK has no\n+other mechanism for configuration. There is no SPI nor processing of environment variables or\n+system properties. There are many mechanisms for configuration, for example Spring Boot. \n+Integration with these systems becomes easier to reason about if we consider auto-configuration at\n+a layer above the core SDK.\n+\n+### Java Auto-Instrumentation Agent\n+\n+Java Auto-Instrumentation Agent is the primary means of automatically configuring the SDK. It\n+contains system properties, environment variables, and SPIs for allowing a user to have a fully\n+setup tracing configuration just by applying the agent. In fact, the agent does not even allow a\n+user to use the SDK directly, actively blocking it. Instead of having a situation where some\n+configuration is automatic in the core SDK and some in the agent, we can move it all to the agent.\n+The agent already exposes exporter SPIs - it can also expose SPIs for customization of the SDK\n+components that are manually configured above.\n+\n+- We could consider having a very similar autoconfiguration wrapper artifact as an SDK extension too.\n+But we would assume the core SDK is always manually configured.\n+\n+To allow users of the agent to apply tracing to their own code, the agent should attempt to\n+instrument dependency injection to provide an instance of `OpenTelemetry` using the agent-configured\n+SDK, for example it should add it to the Spring `ApplicationContext`. For cases where dependency\n+injection is not available, though, there is no option but to provide access to the SDK through a\n+global variable. We can expect such usage to still function correctly even if the agent is removed\n+and a different configuration mechanism is used, such as manual configuration as above, or Spring\n+Sleuth.\n+\n+### SDK Auto-Configuration Wrapper\n+\n+For non-agent users, we can still provide a non-programmatic solution for configuring the SDK -\n+it can be a different artifact which contains SPIs similar to what we have currently, supports\n+environment variables and other auto-configuration. A single entrypoint method, `initialize()` could\n+determine the configuration, initialize `OpenTelemetry`, and set it as the global. As this artifact\n+is in our control, it would be reasonable for `opentelemetry-api` to check the classpath for the\n+presence of the wrapper and invoke it automatically.\n+\n+### Spring Sleuth\n+\n+[Spring Sleuth](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-sleuth) (or any similar observability-aware server framework such as \n+[curio-server-framework](https://github.com/curioswitch/curiostack/blob/master/common/server/framework/src/main/java/org/curioswitch/common/server/framework/monitoring/MonitoringModule.java)\n+or internal frameworks developed by devops teams at companies) is also a mechanism for automatically\n+configuring the SDK. In general, we would expect Sleuth users to not be using the java agent.\n+\n+Examples of how Sleuth could work are presented above in examples using `@Bean`. In particular, we\n+expect it to have its own set of configuration properties - by making sure we don't implement\n+configuration properties in the core SDK, only configuration layers like the agent or a possible\n+configuration wrapper, we avoid the possibility of confusion by having duplicate variables (in\n+practice, OpenTelemetry naming would likely be ignored and overwritten by Spring naming).\n+\n+## Partial SDKs\n+\n+We allow implementing particular signals of the OpenTelemetry API without using our SDK. For example,\n+a MeterProvider may be implemented with micrometer. For this reason, each signal must also present\n+all of its options in the form of, e.g., `TracerSdkProviderBuilder`. We expect the vast majority of\n+users to use `OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder` - while there is some duplication with the signal provider\n+builder, it is work maintainers can do to present the simplest interface for the most common use\n+case of using the whole SDK.\n+\n+Without SPI, the way to initialize a partial SDK would be to use `DefaultOpenTelemetry`.\n+\n+```java\n+@Bean\n+public OpenTelemetry openTelemetry() {\n+  return DefaultOpenTelemetry.builder()", "originalCommit": "8c408f33589c88208325090714a942aed6ed325a", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0MTkwNTk5OA==", "url": "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/pull/2262#discussion_r541905998", "bodyText": "The SDK builder returns types that expose forceFlush and shutdown as required by the spec.

It is a\n+continuation of discussion started with https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/issues/2022.\n+\n+## Target audiences\n+\n+There are a few different target audiences that are related to our configuration story.\n+\n+- Application developers, aka end-users. Often have no knowledge of tracing but want to add \n+OpenTelemetry to their app and see traces show up in a console. Application developers will increase\n+in number forever, while the below are more constant.\n+\n+- Dev-ops / framework developers. Write components or frameworks to support providing tracing to\n+their application developers. May write custom SDK extensions such as exporters, samplers, to fit\n+with their internal infrastructure and as such have some familiarity with tracing at least as the\n+SDK presents it.\n+\n+- Telemetry extension authors. Write custom SDK extensions, often to support a particular backend.\n+Very familiar with telemetry.\n+\n+- OpenTelemetry maintainers. Write the SDK code.\n+\n+When making decisions, especially about complexity, we always prioritize the application developers,\n+then framework developers, then maintainers. This is because we expect those with less domain\n+knowledge about tracing to require a simpler experience than those with more. There is also more\n+bang-for-the-buck by making the end-user experience as streamlined as possible since we expect there\n+to be much more of them than other audiences.\n+\n+## Goals and non-goals\n+\n+### Goals\n+\n+- Provide a single entrypoint to configuring the SDK. For end-users, less familiar with the SDK, we\n+want to have everything together to provide discoverability and simpler end-user code. If there are\n+several, clear use cases which benefit from different entrypoints, we could have multiple\n+corresponding to each one.\n+\n+- Fit well with common Java idioms such as dependency injection, or common frameworks like Spring.\n+\n+- Reduce the chance of gotchas or configuration mishaps.\n+\n+- Aim for optimal performance of the configured SDK for the most common use case.\n+\n+### Non-goals\n+\n+- Provide the best possible experience for custom SDKs. Generally the burden of the experience for\n+custom SDKs can fall on their authors, we optimize for our standard usage, the full SDK. Any\n+reference to \"the SDK\" in this document refers to the full SDK with all signals.\n+\n+- Make sure everything is auto-configurable. This is out of the scope of the SDK, and instead is\n+left to auto-configuration layers, which are also described below but not as part of the core SDK. \n+In partiular, SignalProvider SPIs which currently exist are proposed to be removed from the SDK. The \n+SDK may provide an autoconfiguration extension as an option which is not internal to the main SDK \n+components.\n+\n+## Configuring an instance of the SDK\n+\n+The SDK exposes configuration options for all the signals it supports. Users all have different\n+requirements for how they use the SDK; for example they may use different exporters depending on\n+their backend. Because we cannot guess the configuration the user needs, we expect that the SDK must\n+be configured by the user before it can be used.\n+\n+Goals for configuring the SDK are\n+\n+- Discoverability of options\n+- Ease of use by end users, e.g., less complicated code required\n+- Avoid requiring duplicate configuration, which can lead to errors or confusion\n+- Provide good defaults where possible\n+\n+In Java, the builder pattern is common for configuring instances. Let's look at what that may look\n+like. The simplest configuration will be when a user wants to get a default experience, exporting\n+with a specific exporter to an endpoint.\n+\n+The SDK builder will simply accept its components as builder parameters. It only allows\n+setting SDK implementations and is not meant for use with partial SDKs.\n+\n+```java\n+class OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder {\n+  public OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder setTracerProvider(TracerSdkProvider tracerProvider);\n+  public OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder setMeterProvider(MeterSdkProvider meterProvider);\n+  public OpenTelemetrySdk buildAndSetAsGlobal();\n+  public OpenTelemetrySdk buildWithoutSettingAsGlobal();", "originalCommit": "7139fe83fde9863e4db48bb39a616c5fcba391ef", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0NTQ5MTMwNQ==", "url": "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/pull/2262#discussion_r545491305", "bodyText": "See my note that I think this needs to be a conscious decision, though admittedly don't like the name much either :P", "author": "anuraaga", "createdAt": "2020-12-18T00:19:39Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0NTM4ODY4NA=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}]}
