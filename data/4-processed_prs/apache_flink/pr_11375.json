However, the documentation about \"Python Table API\" is more general, it includes everything about the Python language support about the table module. So I think there is no direct relationship between \"Table API\" and \"Python Table API\". Maybe we should rename it to something else?\nThe documentation about \"Python Table API\" is about the Python language support about the table module and each of the items at the beginning is about one specific functionality about table and so personally I think putting \"Python Table API\" at the end makes more sense.", "author": "dianfu", "createdAt": "2020-03-13T05:48:10Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5MjAyNjM1NQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5MjAyNzI4OQ==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/11375#discussion_r392027289", "bodyText": "Should we also add documentation about how to install PyFlink here? and further simplify document in Python API Tutorial about installation.", "author": "hequn8128", "createdAt": "2020-03-13T04:40:06Z", "path": "docs/dev/table/python/installation.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,40 @@\n+---\n+title: \"Installation\"\n+nav-parent_id: python_tableapi\n+nav-pos: 10\n+---\n+<!--\n+Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\n+or more contributor license agreements.
