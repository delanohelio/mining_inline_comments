The race condition that you described above, does it mean that unannouncedCredit can be out of sync? That we in reality have released all floating buffers, channel is blocked, but actually unannouncedCredit > 0? And it's only fixed after calling resumeConsumption()?\n\nYes, exactly.\n\nAnd as I understand it, without your change, this problem doesn't exist, as floating buffers are kept assigned to the blocked channel and the unannouncedCredit (or maybe even assigned AddCredit that might have been sent to the upstream node) are consistent with the reality. Also those assigned floating buffers are not used because channel is blocked, but that is not a big issue, because thanks to the exclusive buffers, other channels can make a progress?\n\nThat only happens when the exclusive credit is 0. If the exclusive credit is not 0, the allocated floating buffers will not be released and if the exclusive credit is 0, we release the floating buffers allocated to let other channel use them to avoid deadlock, an extreme case is that we only have 1 floating buffer and no exclusive buffer. At downstream, the unannounced credit will be reset, at the upstream, the available credit is also reset to 0 when resume consumption.", "author": "wsry", "createdAt": "2021-07-08T01:53:10Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDY2MTYxNDc2Nw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDY2NjMzNDUwNg==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/11877#discussion_r666334506", "bodyText": "Ok, can you at least add a comment explaining why this is set to 0 here?", "author": "pnowojski", "createdAt": "2021-07-08T16:11:06Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDY2MTYxNDc2Nw=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDY2MTYxNzUyNg==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/11877#discussion_r661617526", "bodyText": "Do we do it because we know that all floating buffers would be released before the checkpoint when initialCredit == 0?", "author": "akalash", "createdAt": "2021-06-30T16:05:45Z", "path": "flink-runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/runtime/io/network/netty/CreditBasedSequenceNumberingViewReader.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -100,8 +106,19 @@ public void addCredit(int creditDeltas) {\n         numCreditsAvailable += creditDeltas;\n     }\n \n+    @Override\n+    public boolean needAnnounceBacklog() {\n+        return initialCredit == 0 && numCreditsAvailable == 0;\n+    }\n+\n     @Override\n     public void resumeConsumption() {\n+        if (initialCredit == 0) {\n+            // reset available credit if no exclusive buffer is available at the\n+            // consumer side for all floating buffers must have been released\n+            numCreditsAvailable = 0;", "originalCommit": "2c49d1a8cee6485e8f367190f152e58960c901ff", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDY2MjAyMDc1OQ==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/11877#discussion_r662020759", "bodyText": "Yes, you are right.", "author": "wsry", "createdAt": "2021-07-01T06:43:05Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDY2MTYxNzUyNg=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "c161aff32e5aed483ca0722e0504ec8493348947", "url": "https://github.com/apache/flink/commit/c161aff32e5aed483ca0722e0504ec8493348947", "message": "[FLINK-16641][network] Announce sender's backlog to solve the deadlock issue without exclusive buffers\n\nThis commit improves the current backlog announcement logic in two main aspects:\n1.

Actually, I think it is a little complicated to do so. Because we need to keep consistency between the sender side available credit and the receiver side floating buffers. If we just release the floating buffers at the receiver side, if the sender side available credit is not reset, then there is may data sent out without buffers at receiver side to receive them. If we also reset the available credit at the sender side when the backlog is 0, there is a possibility that some AddCredit messages are on the way and we are not resetting this part. Maybe one way is to not sending any data out after sending a buffer with 0 backlog at sender side, then the receivers clear all floating credits and send a reset message to the senders.

It should be configured at least 2 for good performance. 1 buffer is for receiving in-flight data in the subpartition and 1 buffer is for parallel serialization. The minimum valid value can be configured is 0 and when 0 is configured, the exclusive network buffers used per downstream incoming channel will be 0, but for each upstream outgoing channel, max(1, configured value) will be used which means that at least one buffer is needed and this behavior is for performance. If it's not guaranteed that each outgoing channel can get at least one buffer, more partial buffers with little data will be outputted to network/disk and recycled to be used by other channels which can not get a buffer for data caching.</td>", "originalCommit": "da81fde5fc9e110075cff4982048b7f7ee3a0d61", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "dbb34f9ce26fdec9ee5a6d67b9545dd2cbb18903", "url": "https://github.com/apache/flink/commit/dbb34f9ce26fdec9ee5a6d67b9545dd2cbb18903", "message": "[hotfix] Remove redundant if condition in BufferManager\n\nThis closes #11877.", "committedDate": "2021-07-12T10:30:47Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "29d20e309908eea85d077c9f96f9c337217ee89b", "url": "https://github.com/apache/flink/commit/29d20e309908eea85d077c9f96f9c337217ee89b", "message": "[hotfix] Remove outdated comments in UnionInputGate\n\nThis closes #11877.", "committedDate": "2021-07-12T10:30:47Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "c3428a92d528b20b61d030429b9099347144256d", "url": "https://github.com/apache/flink/commit/c3428a92d528b20b61d030429b9099347144256d", "message": "[hotfix] Simplify RemoteInputChannel#onSenderBacklog and call the existing method directly\n\nThis closes #11877.", "committedDate": "2021-07-12T10:30:47Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "b23c8f4778af071cb16b0f80b8357db4477ff812", "url": "https://github.com/apache/flink/commit/b23c8f4778af071cb16b0f80b8357db4477ff812", "message": "[hotfix] Fix typos in NettyShuffleUtils\n\nThis closes #11877.", "committedDate": "2021-07-12T10:30:47Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "bede6d39163df06f22a1d64df440d1067408b2ec", "url": "https://github.com/apache/flink/commit/bede6d39163df06f22a1d64df440d1067408b2ec", "message": "[FLINK-16641][network] (Part#1) Introduce a new network message BacklogAnnouncement which can bring the upstream buffer backlog to the downstream", "committedDate": "2021-07-12T10:30:47Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "0ffa4e02e374cc5724552a4af8a15d03c8e31cca", "url": "https://github.com/apache/flink/commit/0ffa4e02e374cc5724552a4af8a15d03c8e31cca", "message": "[FLINK-16641][network] (Part#2) Distinguish data buffer and event buffer for BoundedBlockingSubpartitionDirectTransferReader\n\nCurrently, the BoundedBlockingSubpartitionDirectTransferReader does not distinguish data buffer and event buffer but it does not allocate floating credits for events, which means it relies on at least one exclusive credit to send the events.
