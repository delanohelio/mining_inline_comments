However, for larger setups, it can take a while to calculate mappings and thus it should be avoided for all aligned checkpoints, interchanges without data, and for trivial setup (simple upscaling of shuffles).\n\nThere were some optimizations already in the code but it relied on determining the simple cases in advance, which is quite complicated and fell short in two regards. In certain cases, such as channels that or filled only on either upstream or downstream, it was too aggressive and lead to wrong results. Further, some optimization opportunities were left out.\n\nThis commit also generalizes RescaledChannelMapping to RescaleMappings to be additionally used for subtask mappings.\n\nIn this refactoring, the calculation of most aux structure is lazy to simplify the detection of the cases.

Upon reinspection, it turned out that the partitioner cache inside the RecordFilterFactory actually violated that assumption and it turns out that you are correct.\nCurrently, the filter is only used for keyed exchanges and blinks hash partitioner where the partitioners are stateless. However, that may not be true in the future and it also doesn't necessarily hold for custom partitioners when they are forced.\nHowever, since the retrieval of the partitioner is rather costly for one input tasks, I retained the cache and instead rely on a proper StreamPartitioner#copy implementation. Note that indeed quite a few of these implementations are a bit whacky (returning this although the partitioner is stateful), but none of that applies to the partitioner that produce ambiguous channels, so I left as is for now.", "author": "AHeise", "createdAt": "2021-03-10T10:02:44Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU4MzQ4OTY1OA=="}, {"id":

"[FLINK-19801][checkpoint] Using lazy initialization of aux structure while creating InflightDataRescalingDescriptor.\n\nFor rescaling unaligned checkpoints, rescaling descriptors need to be calculated. However, for larger setups, it can take a while to calculate mappings and thus it should be avoided for all aligned checkpoints, interchanges without data, and for trivial setup (simple upscaling of shuffles).\n\nThere were some optimizations already in the code but it relied on determining the simple cases in advance, which is quite complicated and fell short in two regards. In certain cases, such as channels that or filled only on either upstream or downstream, it was too aggressive and lead to wrong results. Further, some optimization opportunities were left out.\n\nIn this refactoring, the calculation of most aux structure is lazy to simplify the detection of the cases. Accordingly, most calculations are moved inside TaskStateAssignment and properly encapsulated.", "committedDate": "2021-03-03T21:57:18Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"oid": "90873ee40bb726e584a2711e076ca26ad171d83f", "url": "https://github.com/apache/flink/commit/90873ee40bb726e584a2711e076ca26ad171d83f", "message": "WIP Trying to debug native memory leaks", "committedDate": "2021-03-03T22:22:19Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"oid": "29683f9cd2f62707d5f67f0afac5c7d83776fa00", "url": "https://github.com/apache/flink/commit/29683f9cd2f62707d5f67f0afac5c7d83776fa00", "message": "WIP Trying to debug native memory leaks", "committedDate": "2021-03-04T06:39:28Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"oid": "3248e7c8f3c01e1ac5ba69a463d4272b733b10d2", "url": "https://github.com/apache/flink/commit/3248e7c8f3c01e1ac5ba69a463d4272b733b10d2", "message": "WIP Trying to debug native memory leaks", "committedDate": "2021-03-04T07:10:12Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"oid": "507697ab09ec0f4380d1e29133cdb8b0416a0c77", "url": "https://github.com/apache/flink/commit/507697ab09ec0f4380d1e29133cdb8b0416a0c77", "message": "[FLINK-19801][tests] Adding rescaling IT for unaligned checkpoints.", "committedDate": "2021-03-04T09:11:50Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"oid": "96661504184c87f29d6a5f4c673e65e8a96a2775", "url": "https://github.com/apache/flink/commit/96661504184c87f29d6a5f4c673e65e8a96a2775", "message": "[FLINK-19801][tests] Adding rescaling IT for unaligned checkpoints.", "committedDate": "2021-03-04T09:18:40Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"oid": "e11f29896312c9a3f744cecc6aeb489f6d00c9a2", "url": "https://github.com/apache/flink/commit/e11f29896312c9a3f744cecc6aeb489f6d00c9a2", "message": "[FLINK-19801][tests] Adding rescaling IT for unaligned checkpoints.", "committedDate": "2021-03-04T09:53:22Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"oid": "89ef91e99f9946f5defb5ecf0d165ae19a52f292", "url": "https://github.com/apache/flink/commit/89ef91e99f9946f5defb5ecf0d165ae19a52f292", "message": "[FLINK-19801][tests] Adding rescaling IT for unaligned checkpoints.", "committedDate": "2021-03-04T09:53:59Z", "type": "forcePushed"}]}
