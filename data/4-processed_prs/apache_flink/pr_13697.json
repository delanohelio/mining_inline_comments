Currently, these are the public methods in the Bucket, ie.  the BucketID getBucketId(), Path getBucketPath(), and long getPartCounter().\nActually, I would recommend to not expose the part counter because this will not be supported anymore in the new FileSink. If you need access to the in-progress file path, then simply pass that (the result of the assembleNewPartPath()) it in a field and have a method getInProgressFilePath() in the new BucketInfo interface.", "author": "kl0u", "createdAt": "2020-10-27T16:33:49Z", "path": "flink-streaming-java/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/streaming/api/functions/sink/filesystem/FileLifeCycleListener.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,41 @@\n+/*\n+ * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\n+ * or more contributor license agreements.
