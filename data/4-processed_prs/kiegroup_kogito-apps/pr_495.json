As for the configuration XML, correct that is used for these different services, including data index. The reason is there is because indexing must be enabled, otherwise it restricts some of our searching capabilities. As opposed to runtimes, where we use it as a simple key-value store, so default config from Infinispan is fine. We can look into doing something like this for runtimes if there is some specific need.", "author": "cristianonicolai", "createdAt": "2020-10-27T15:37:22Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxMjcxMjYzMQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "b44b19af1e9260b64703488d1c438afe037988c8", "url": "https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-apps/commit/b44b19af1e9260b64703488d1c438afe037988c8", "message": "KOGITO-3118 Infinispan 11 upgrade", "committedDate": "2020-10-27T15:31:46Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "b44b19af1e9260b64703488d1c438afe037988c8", "url": "https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-apps/commit/b44b19af1e9260b64703488d1c438afe037988c8", "message": "KOGITO-3118 Infinispan 11 upgrade", "committedDate": "2020-10-27T15:31:46Z", "type": "forcePushed"}]}
