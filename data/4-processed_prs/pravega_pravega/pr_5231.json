The reason why we want to be able to preserve the \"you need READ_UPDATE to touch/mutate this ReaderGroup\" behavior is for these types of deployments where:\n\nenvironments where low level granular \"ahead of time\" acl provisioning is not possible due to the fact that the resources, scopes, streams, reader groups, are not known ahead of time.\nthere is a conscious intent to apply ACLs at the scope level because it's easier to manage for the admin, who does not have to worry about new streams getting created and having to micro manage at that level.  Scopes are more viewed like \"teams\" or \"tenants\".\n\nFor that reason, heavy use of wild cards is required usually at the scope level.  That means that if \"READ\" allowed access to reader groups in general, reader subjects could be interfering with each other.\nAn example of this is when members of a team called \"compute1\" scope for which was created so they can run their own applications etc.   chris is part of that team.\nThere's also a \"compute2\" team/scope with a jack user in it.\nThere is also a team called marketdata with a scope and streams into which stock market data was ingested etc.\nThe desire is that members from compute1 and compute2 can read any streams (present and future) from marketdata but not alter any data. Additionally not be able to mess with reader groups synchronizer states in marketdata or reader groups from the other team's scope.\nACLs would look like this:\nREAD on prn://scope:marketdata/* and READ_UPDATE on prn://scope:compute1/* to chris\nREAD on prn://scope:marketdata/* and READ_UPDATE on prn://scope:compute1/* to jack\n\nchris can read marketata/streamXYZ and is tracking its RG state in compute1/...\njack can read marketata/streamXYZ and is tracking its RG state in compute2/...\nIt is assumed that if chris's friend maddy, with common READ_UPDATE rights on compute1 enters the picture, she can see and update the RG that chris created.  But she's part of the same team.  That is ok).  jack however, is prevented from accessing chris and maddy's RGs, while still benefiting from accessing marketdata's streams.\nIf the READ on prn://scope:marketdata/* was allowing mutation of reader groups, then in theory chris and jack could create reader groups there and mess with each other's reader groups. So in this use case, it's best to remain with the \"Mutation/access to Reader groups is still protected by READ_UPDATE\", such that chris and jack are forced to put their reader groups in their own team scopes.\nThe flag that's added in this PR, when set to false, allows the above to work.", "author": "sarlaccpit", "createdAt": "2020-11-05T17:39:01Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxNTg0MjgzNA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxODkzNjcxNA==", "url": "https://github.com/pravega/pravega/pull/5231#discussion_r518936714", "bodyText": "@sarlaccpit thanks for patiently explaining the reasoning behind the option.

The option we are discussing is fairly obscure.\nThe use of wildcards you describe makes sense. If users with read authorization can create reader groups, then they would be messing up with their own reader group. If that's undesirable, which is reasonable, then perhaps we can require read_update to create a reader group, and only read to join.\nOne point I don't understand: what happens if a reader group is configured to read from stream A and B, and a given reader that tries to join is only authorized to read from A?

Although that seems like part of what @ravisharda is likely planning in the future; which is the addition of finer grained permissions, beyond READ and READ_UPDATE which admittedly are not fine grain enough (in general that is, not just for reader groups).  One can imagine the need for things like DELETE, and also WRITE_ONLY (append only) that I have seen mentioned in other context.\nBut I don't think this is part of this PR (which is already ambitious as it is :).   So @ravisharda can correct me, but basically READ_UPDATE on the reader group basically means: use the reader group and do what you need with it.\nFor the question of the reader group tracking multiple streams, not all of which you may have access to.   Again, @ravisharda  can say best, but I believe the permission on the reader group is what the focus is, the reader group being its own entity.   The fact it's related to streams is sort of an aside I think?
