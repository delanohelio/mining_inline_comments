This file will be deleted in a subsequent PR.\r\n* Set up GitHub Actions workflow as follows:\r\n   - Triggers on master branch and release branch pushes, on every pull request (regardless of branch) and release publish.\r\n    - Has a compile and static analysis job, followed by a few parallel test jobs, then a check and a snapshot (only for master branch and release branches).\r\n    - Check job is called CI Complete.\r\n* Bonus features:\r\n    - Build output is cached after the Build step and reused for subsequent jobs. This speeds up the overall workflow run.\r\n    - Test execution output, history and reports is cached on a per workflow-job basis. If a workflow is re-run for whatever reason (such as one job failing), the successful jobs will execute much faster (by skipping all tests that passed).\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Andrei Paduroiu <andrei.paduroiu@dell.com>\nSigned-off-by: Tom Kaitchuck <tom.kaitchuck@emc.com>", "committedDate": "2021-02-15T20:17:25Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "be71f8a35f5817325a0edd160af6b76eb5df8ac4", "url": "https://github.com/pravega/pravega/commit/be71f8a35f5817325a0edd160af6b76eb5df8ac4", "message": "Issue 5546, 5547: Fix flaky tests (#5564)\n\nFixes for flaky tests: \r\n- Ensure system test DynamicRestApi works with auth enabled.\r\n- Remove incorrect fix with SO_REUSEADDR when looking for free ports in tests.\r\n- Fixed bug in EndToEndTruncationTest.testDeleteStreamWhileReading().\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Sandeep <sandeep.shridhar@emc.com>\nSigned-off-by: Tom Kaitchuck <tom.kaitchuck@emc.com>", "committedDate": "2021-02-15T20:17:25Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "ee0992d14c4613319680e9cd080d090fe6093dae", "url": "https://github.com/pravega/pravega/commit/ee0992d14c4613319680e9cd080d090fe6093dae", "message": "Issue 5518: (SLTS) Fix Integer overflow.

The solution here it to attempt to block on the seal being completed. sealedSegmentQueue.isEmpty() Would tell us that no seal operation is pending. This is a necessary but not a sufficient criteria, because there could be still one in progress. The writeSealLock is not needed to do anything here, (Notice nothing is done inside of the lock) it's just done to queue the flush thread on an ongoing seal if one is indeed in progress.\nIf this is
