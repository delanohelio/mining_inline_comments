Having done lots TPL based programming in the past, I was sort of reluctant to rewrite this code for async knowing it makes very difficult to maintain spaghetti code with lots of lambdas.\nHowever we absolutely do need it here.\nThe general pattern that I have here for thread safety is as follows\n\nEach major function in linear non-async code becomes a method object. Each invocation is a separate object. So separate invocations share nothing.\nAll members must be either final or volatile\nIf you need to use any arithmetic then it is better to use Atomic variables (which actually just volatile variables with additional safety added for atomic addition/subtraction)\nThe labmdas are executed in series by java sdk (i.e CompletableFuture framework) one lambda at a time.\nThe JVM memory model guarantees that reads and writes to volatile variable are thread safe.\n\nWriting all this async code by hand and yet keeping it understandable is not easy. But hopefully code gets better, faster and also cleaner as we go.", "author": "sachin-j-joshi", "createdAt": "2020-12-10T13:50:23Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0MDAxMDc1Mw=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}]}
