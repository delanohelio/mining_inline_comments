In this class, the only thing changing the internal state is applyCachePolicyInternal, which is guarded by the lock. I decided to make all these fields AtomicXYZ because I didn't want to acquire some lock just to query them. To be clear, applyCachePolicyInternal modifies these values, but they are queried in other places as well, which should be OK for thread safety purposes.\nThe only exception to this rule is this.clients, which keeps track of all the Cache Manager's Clients, and is a collection that is modified when new segments are activated or evicted from memory, hence out of the control of the Cache Manager. However, no external APIs are invoked while using the clients lock, so no chance for deadlock there.", "author": "andreipaduroiu", "createdAt": "2020-04-20T15:21:36Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQxMDUxMTUzMQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}]}
