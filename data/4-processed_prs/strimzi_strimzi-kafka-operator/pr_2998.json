The problem is that the pod name from a deployment is built from the deployment name, a random number for the underlying replicaset and another random number related to the pod itself. With StatefulSets of course it is simpler due to the naming convention with ordinals. Anyway I agree, this utils class is at pod level so it's better don't mention St's.
