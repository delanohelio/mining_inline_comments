But I think it does something different then we do. We do not validate the protocol / format version here. We want to to get the numeric part only and compare it against the version if they match which tells us they are from the same version. The actual version is validated in other place in our case.\nSo I think the original pattern works well apart from not expecting any double-digit major Kafka versions. But the use of the matcher seems to be weird. The group 0 returns the whole pattern. So that seems to be wrong because when you use protocol format as 2.6-IV0 it would never match 2.6.0. So I tried to fix that by using the right group.\nPlease have a look and let me know if I misunderstood what you meant.", "author": "scholzj", "createdAt": "2020-12-07T17:21:54Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUzNzUzMTE5Ng=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUzODQyNTE1Nw==", "url": "https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/pull/4058#discussion_r538425157", "bodyText": "Group 0 is always the whole match, and the capturing groups are then 1-based.
