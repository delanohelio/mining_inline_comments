Recreate your cluster.\n++\n+Follow the steps depending on whether or not you have all the `KafkaTopic` resources needed to recreate your cluster.\n++\n+--\n+*_Option 1_*: If you have *all* the `KafkaTopic` resources that existed before you lost your cluster, including internal topics such as committed offsets from `__consumer_offsets`:\n+\n+. Recreate all `KafkaTopic` resources.\n++\n+It is essential that you recreate the resources before deploying the cluster, or the Topic Operator will delete the topics.\n+\n+. Deploy the Kafka cluster.\n++\n+For example:\n++\n+[source,shell,subs=\"+quotes,attributes\"]\n+----\n+kubectl apply -f _kafka.yaml_\n+----\n+--\n++\n+--\n+*_Option 2_*: If you do not have all the `KafkaTopic` resources that existed before you lost your cluster:\n+\n+. Deploy the Kafka cluster, as with the first option, but without the Topic Operator by removing `topicOperator: {}` from the Kafka resource before deploying.\n++\n+If you include the Topic Operator in the deployment, the Topic Operator will delete all the topics.\n+\n+. Run an `exec` command to one of the Kafka broker pods to open the ZooKeeper shell script.\n++\n+For example, where _my-cluster-kafka-0_ is the name of the broker pod:\n++\n+[source,shell,subs=\"+quotes,attributes\"]\n+----\n+kubectl exec _my-cluster-kafka-0_ bin/zookeeper-shell.sh localhost:2181\n+----\n+. Delete the whole `/strimzi` path to remove the Topic Operator storage:\n++\n+[source,shell,subs=\"+quotes,attributes\"]\n+----\n+deleteall /strimzi\n+----\n+. Enable the Topic Operator by redeploying the Kafka cluster with `topicOperator: {}` to recreate the `KafkaTopic` resources.\n++\n+For example:\n++\n+[source,shell,subs=\"+quotes,attributes\"]\n+----\n+apiVersion: {KafkaApiVersion}\n+kind: Kafka\n+metadata:\n+  name: my-cluster\n+spec:\n+  #...\n+  entityOperator:\n+    *topicOperator: {}*", "originalCommit": "19a697b27c54bd95b1023445b8c6d2514ffcc7e1", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3MDUzMTgxMg==", "url": "https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/pull/2396#discussion_r370531812", "bodyText": "I've added a callout:\n\n<1> Here we show the default configuration, which has no additional properties.\nYou specify the required configuration using the properties described in xref:type-EntityTopicOperatorSpec-reference[].", "author": "PaulRMellor", "createdAt": "2020-01-24T09:09:38Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3MDAwNjgzNQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "c0cb6ad9bd2228b0f95d987cab789f79a029f45d", "url": "https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/commit/c0cb6ad9bd2228b0f95d987cab789f79a029f45d", "message": "review edits PP + small edit for downstream build\n\nSigned-off-by: prmellor <pmellor@redhat.com>", "committedDate": "2020-01-24T09:21:42Z", "type": "commit"}]}
