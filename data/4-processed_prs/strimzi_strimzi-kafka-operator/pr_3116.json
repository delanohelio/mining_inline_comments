I assume the approval of a proposal is the same thing as merging its PR. When it's implemented we'd need another PR to update the overview again. I'm thinking it might be easier to use labels on the PRs themselves to track the status, avoiding the need for a dedicated overview. That doesn't really solve the numbering problem though.

It is too hidden away to hard to find.\nThe numbers in my mind were sequential not bound to PR numbers. I do not think the frequency of the proposals will be (at least initially) high enough to cause problema. And the number is important as it gives you an idea about the age of the proposal.
