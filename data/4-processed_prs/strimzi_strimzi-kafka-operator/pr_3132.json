If it was emptyList() or asList() I'm guessing you'd be a little more comfortable with it, because you'd be more prepared to guess it was Collections.emptyList() or Arrays.asList(), because those methods are more familiar to you. Personally I know those APIs pretty well, so I guess I'm more comfortable with code like this, and I don't especially like seeing those methods class qualified.\nIf you feel strongly about it maybe we should formalise which classes & methods we consider OK for static imports, and use https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/config_imports.html#AvoidStaticImport to prevent static imports of anything else.
