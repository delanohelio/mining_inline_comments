The image could be built by a different team than the person that used it to install the helm chart so in that sense you could use helm with just a reference to a CAS image in a docker registry (custom built by someone for your particular deployment). That process of running initializer, building image and pushing to docker hub (or private registry) could be done in a gitlab or github pipeline so people could clone the pipeline, configure their credentials  and desired modules as external variables or arguments and then get an image without ever running gradle themselves.\nI think the chart is at a decent place (alpha) in the sense that in the cicd pipeline it installs the chart and then CAS and boot admin both come up and talk to each other. Everything is using SSL and one could argue that SSL could terminate at the ingress controller. If I was deploying this with X509 auth I would terminate client ssl at an F5 or HAProxy and send the client cert to kubernetes ingress controller via http header (and that could be SSL too). Eventually maybe there will be an option to use SSL or not. The validate-helm.sh script is running with set -e so if anything breaks it should show up in the pipeline as failed.\nThe values.yaml contains cas config that can include references to helm values from values file or other values files and set arguments, but the template functions only work if property file is yaml format. I think it is due to this issue:\nhelm/helm#8890\nhelm/helm#7704\nBasically you can only use the {{ .Values.someval }} in the yaml configmap in the values file (unless it is in first 80 characters of the non-yaml properties file).\nI may add something so that the default config can pull services out of a git service registry and maybe install a ticket registry like redis (from a stock helm chart) so that the CAS cluster could be scaled up and be available to run a load test against.\nOther TODOs:\n\nmoving the credentials used by CAS and Boot Admin to into secrets (or encrypting them)\nsetting CAS jasypt encryption keys as secrets\ndo something with cas shell... maybe run an image that stays running with some dummy command and someone can exec into it and run the shell?\ndo something for saml metadata (chart already supports arbitrary volumes so someone could mount a PV now)\nadd way to specify spring profiles that are used via helm values\nmake boot admin optional\nchart is currently using hdeadman/cas-bootadmin-server docker hub image for boot admin but I can switch to apereo when you publish new one, I built mine from current overlay template\neventually publish helm chart or host it somewhere\n\nDo you envision this initializr branch being incorporated into master at some point? It seems sort of hidden but I suppose the documentation will make it more visible.", "author": "hdeadman", "createdAt": "2020-12-01T22:29:52Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyNzUzNTY4OQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyNzUzNjUxNQ==", "url": "https://github.com/apereo/cas/pull/4975#discussion_r527536515", "bodyText": "Could we add support for Windows and MACOS here?", "author": "mmoayyed", "createdAt": "2020-11-20T08:57:19Z", "path": ".github/workflows/initializr-build.yml", "diffHunk": "@@ -72,3 +72,43 @@ jobs:\n           imageTag=(`./gradlew casVersion --q`)\n           echo \"Pushing Docker image with tag $imageTag\"\n           docker push apereo/cas-initializr:\"$imageTag\"\n+  helm:\n+    needs: [build]\n+    runs-on: ubuntu-latest", "originalCommit": "430740a3f1d0046ad3915ad56451e76f67eba285", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUzMDcwODc5NQ==", "url": "https://github.com/apereo/cas/pull/4975#discussion_r530708795", "bodyText": "Running the helm installation on windows or MacOS would require a linux VM with kubernetes, which I don't imagine is that could be done in cicd.
