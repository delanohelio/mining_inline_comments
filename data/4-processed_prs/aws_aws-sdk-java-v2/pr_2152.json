You have a valid argument, but also S3 doesn't necessarily distinguish between S3 data plane and control plane API calls in terms on how they receive and process requests. Also we already have a dependency on S3.\nHowever I think I can be persuaded to copy it since it IS very small and dependencies are potentially expensive in the future...", "author": "cenedhryn", "createdAt": "2020-11-19T18:59:46Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyNzA4MDg4Ng=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyNzEzMDE2Nw==", "url": "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/pull/2152#discussion_r527130167", "bodyText": "I think if we're going to share it and make it protected we should move it to a place that we can get to it without needing to go through the S3 module.
