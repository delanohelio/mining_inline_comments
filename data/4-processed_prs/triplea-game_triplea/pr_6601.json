We have a dedicated build stage for running the 'tests' in the smoke-testing\n  project, it is redundant to run them in the 'unit test' stage. The separation\n  is there for performance, so we do not slow down unit tests and to make\n  debugging easier in case there is a test failure (with isolated stages,\n  if one fails, there are fewer things being run and so there are fewer\n  reasons to see a failure)\n\n2. Minor, combine gradle steps together.", "committedDate": "2020-06-06T20:04:43Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzNjM3NTk0MQ==", "url": "https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/pull/6601#discussion_r436375941", "bodyText": "Does it work if --parallel just is written -parallel now?", "author": "RoiEXLab", "createdAt": "2020-06-07T15:43:08Z", "path": ".travis/stages/verify/unit-testing/run", "diffHunk": "@@ -3,10 +3,8 @@\n set -eEux\n \n # Run Tests\n-./gradlew --parallel test", "originalCommit": "b3f77af407add1b28e7bbc4ba9b5ef8ece00a43a", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzNjM4NTE0NA==", "url": "https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/pull/6601#discussion_r436385144", "bodyText": "FWIW, from the gradle help text:\n\n--parallel                Build projects in parallel.
