It's also not consistent as the other lines sets the game data directly and this uses a setter method. Generally, AFAIK it's better to avoid setter methods within a class (lest someone overrides your setter method and then suddenly they've changed a lot more code then expected).\n2nd, the abstraction of the method above seems to be kinda mixed. It's basically:\nlow level checks\nlow level setting\nlow level checks\n\nif( low level condition)\n    do medium level\nelse\n   do low level\n\nI recommend to accept a GameData parameter to this method and then you can re-use. Arguably it's a method so that the code can be re-used, but we still have the same calls on lines 91 and 92 (it's not the same, but the data we set is the same, that would be the idea behind DRY, the information of which values to set is repeated in 2 places).\nAs a method, it would be:\nprivate void setDefaultGame(@Nullable final URI fileUri, @Nullable final GAmeData gamedata) {\n  if(gameData == null) {\n    ClientSetting.defaultGameName.resetValue();\n    ClientSetting.defaultGameUri.resetValue();  \n  } else {\n      ClientSetting.defaultGameName.setValue(gameData.getGameName());\n      ClientSetting.defaultGameUri.setValue(uri.toString());\n  }\n   ClientSetting.flush();\n}\n\n\nNow, looking at the above, the fact we have a decoupled file uri and game name is really not good too. That looks very much like a data clump code smell and would do well to be unified behind a single object or a single data type.
