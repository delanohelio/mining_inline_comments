This could cause unit stacking\nbecause of the higher value of the territory.\n\nNow, when the ProAI calculates the neighboring territories, it checks if\nunits can travel between between the two territories.

Eventually perhaps. Hiding the always true predicate in the implementation class I think is the thing to do. If we can, also hide additional predicates in that class so the callers are just invoking a function and not passing in a predicate. The predicate object is a bit too low level. Consider for example using a method that iterates over territories and requires a predicate, you really have to look at the implementation details to understand what the predicate is going to do exactly. Then if we change that implementation all of the expectations of the callers are broken. I think it's an example of relatively tight coupling and lack of information hiding.\nTL;DR - simple inlining of Matches.always() could do more harm than good if it is used pervasively.

I disagree it is premature at all. We are setting a pattern. If another developer were to look at what is done here, \"I need more functionality in this method - okay, add a parameter that only one part of the code uses and the rest will just pass a no-op value.\" Rinse-wash-repeat, and then eventually the concern of having too many params arise and the response is \"the code was already like that, fixing all usages is out of scope, it is consistent to just add another parameter.\" Hence, I would say it's premature to add a parameter that make the method prematurely generic.\nI don't see what it is a big change to encapsulate the match condition with the getNeighbor method. As-is, I think we violate DRY (which is about expressing an idea in one place, less about removing all duplicate patterns). Currently the neighbor logic is spread between match conditions only used for getNeighbor, the caller that invokes the method with the right parameter bindings, and then the logic in GameMap. Which is where the pattern is not a good one to follow, what if someone were to use this new public method API and pass in another match condition? It'd be an even worse situation, rather than the pattern to encapsulate the getNeighbor logic to one place.\nThough again, I think we can do better than having a 4 param method and just add another method. We are debating so far between adding a 4 arg public method vs a 2 arg public method. The latter is readily tested, the former would likely involve heavy mocking and likely would not test very much. The heuristic of \"can this be reasonably tested\" I think fails when we consider almost any 4 arg method, this is an example I believe.\nFor more consideration, a predicate can be expressed as a bi-predicate, so we could keep the predicate logic all in the caller and add just one new API.

I think that code belongs in a sub-project, and then ideally we could push a ton of supporting logic into that sub-project as well. I think that would clean up the core game-engine (game-core) considerably.\nFor example, WeakAI would be removed but it is injected as a dummy player into the battle logic. Keep an eye out for that, if you can sever the WeakAI from the OOL & battle logic & battle calculator, then we could drop that AI completely.", "author": "DanVanAtta", "createdAt": "2020-12-01T06:17:50Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUzMjI1NzY4MA=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUzMjI1Nzk0NA==", "url": "https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/pull/8289#discussion_r532257944", "bodyText": "Similar comment to this method, it's either invoked with a no-op arg or the arg is always:\n                  ProMatches.territoryCanPotentiallyMoveLandUnits(player, data.getProperties()),\n                  ProMatches.noCanalsBetweenTerritories(player, data));\n\nThat hints that we could use another method rather than it need to be parameterized as part of the public API.", "author": "DanVanAtta", "createdAt": "2020-11-29T19:57:45Z", "path": "game-core/src/main/java/games/strategy/engine/data/GameMap.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -317,10 +355,27 @@ public int getDistance(final Territory t1, final Territory t2) {\n    * @param cond condition that covered territories of the route must match\n    */\n   public int getDistance(final Territory t1, final Territory t2, final Predicate<Territory> cond) {\n+    return getDistance(t1, t2, cond, (it, it2) -> true);\n+  }\n+\n+  /**\n+   * Returns the distance between two territories where the covered territories of the route satisfy\n+   * the condition or -1 if they are not connected.\n+   *\n+   * @param t1 start territory of the route\n+   * @param t2 end territory of the route\n+   * @param cond condition that covered territories of the route must match\n+   * @param routeCond condition that routes between neighboring territories must match\n+   */\n+  public int getDistance(", "originalCommit": "7befed3ddb61344407847c2f66caa58af2a9ce35", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "9eb9d523ff1ee50f70441970e39416c11497c3be", "url": "https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/commit/9eb9d523ff1ee50f70441970e39416c11497c3be", "message": "Change variable names and lengthen comments", "committedDate": "2020-11-30T03:17:43Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "88dd27d7d4c089437220841d0feb5ce62e0ccf20", "url": "https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/commit/88dd27d7d4c089437220841d0feb5ce62e0ccf20", "message": "Add shim code to combine predicate and bipredicates to be a single call to a bipredicate only method", "committedDate": "2020-12-01T05:51:03Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "593bfde74a2528bc56e7f085b85553ab2519a186", "url": "https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/commit/593bfde74a2528bc56e7f085b85553ab2519a186", "message": "Remove shimmed methods, change invocations of (predicate, bipredicate) methods to invoke (bipredicate) methods directly", "committedDate": "2020-12-01T05:57:32Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "0b8513b65a8076ac675def4ce90894d3db80a6d9", "url": "https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/commit/0b8513b65a8076ac675def4ce90894d3db80a6d9", "message": "Remove another shimmed method", "committedDate": "2020-12-01T06:01:04Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "4712928a4b5ae5b0265ac803088b6f5668a8e927", "url": "https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/commit/4712928a4b5ae5b0265ac803088b6f5668a8e927", "message": "Fix refactoring mistake, use correct variable in condition.", "committedDate": "2020-12-01T06:19:50Z", "type": "commit"}]}
