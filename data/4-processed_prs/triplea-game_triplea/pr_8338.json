I think some this method block would be relatively clear returning when we can. For example, the last 'else' statement would avoid some extra thought to realize that `availableTargets' is equal to 'hitTargets'.\nPersonally I've come to find the single-return point design is only really good for longer methods, ones that are complicated and return for different reasons at different places. For short methods, something like the below is just fine IMO:\nif\n   return\nelse if\n   return\nelse\n   return\n\nThe above example I'd say is more clear than the single return variable, ie:\nvar returnVal;\nif\n   returnVal = a\nelse if\n   returnVal =b\nelse\n   returnVal =c\n\nreturn returnVal", "author": "DanVanAtta", "createdAt": "2020-12-06T07:13:15Z", "path": "game-core/src/main/java/games/strategy/triplea/delegate/battle/casualty/AaCasualtySelector.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -114,265 +112,209 @@ private static CasualtyDetails getLowLuckAaCasualties(\n       final List<Unit> availableTargets,\n       final AaPowerStrengthAndRolls unitPowerAndRollsMap,\n       final DiceRoll dice,\n-      final IDelegateBridge bridge,\n-      final boolean allowMultipleHitsPerUnit) {\n+      final IDelegateBridge bridge) {\n \n-    int hitsLeft = dice.getHits();\n+    final LowLuckTargetGroups targetGroups =\n+        createGuaranteedLowLuckHitGroups(availableTargets, dice, unitPowerAndRollsMap);\n \n-    // if we can damage units, do it now\n-    final CasualtyDetails finalCasualtyDetails = new CasualtyDetails();\n-    final int highestAttack = unitPowerAndRollsMap.getBestStrength();\n-    if (highestAttack < 1) {\n-      return new CasualtyDetails();\n-    }\n-    final int chosenDiceSize = unitPowerAndRollsMap.getDiceSides();\n-    final boolean allSameAttackPower = unitPowerAndRollsMap.isSameStrength();\n-    // multiple HP units need to be counted multiple times:\n-    // killing the air by groups does not work if the the attack power is different for some of the\n-    // rolls\n-    // also, killing by groups does not work if some of the aa guns have 'MayOverStackAA' and we\n-    // have more hits than the\n-    // total number of groups (including the remainder group)\n-    // (when i mean, 'does not work', i mean that it is no longer a mathematically fair way to find\n-    // casualties)\n-    // find group size (if no groups, do dice sides)\n-    final int groupSize;\n-    if (allSameAttackPower) {\n-      groupSize = chosenDiceSize / highestAttack;\n-    } else {\n-      groupSize = chosenDiceSize;\n-    }\n-    final int numberOfGroupsByDiceSides =\n-        (int) Math.ceil((double) availableTargets.size() / (double) groupSize);\n-    final boolean tooManyHitsToDoGroups = hitsLeft > numberOfGroupsByDiceSides;\n-    if (!allSameAttackPower || tooManyHitsToDoGroups || chosenDiceSize % highestAttack != 0) {\n-      // we have too many hits, so just pick randomly\n-      return calculateAaCasualties(availableTargets, unitPowerAndRollsMap, dice, bridge);\n+    if (targetGroups.guaranteedHitGroups.isEmpty()) {\n+      // it is not possible to separate the targets into guaranteed hit groups so randomly choose\n+      // the targets instead\n+      return buildCasualtyDetails(\n+          availableTargets, findRandomTargets(availableTargets, bridge, dice.getHits()));\n     }\n \n-    // if we have a group of 6 fighters and 2 bombers, and dicesides is 6, and attack was 1, then we\n-    // would want 1\n-    // fighter to die for sure. this is what group size is for.\n-    // if the attack is greater than 1 though, and all use the same attack power, then the group\n-    // size can be smaller\n-    // (ie: attack is 2, and we have 3 fighters and 2 bombers, we would want 1 fighter to die for\n-    // sure).\n-    // categorize with groupSize\n-    final Tuple<List<List<Unit>>, List<Unit>> airSplit =\n-        categorizeLowLuckAirUnits(availableTargets, groupSize);\n-    // the non rolling air units\n-    // if we are less hits than the number of groups, OR we have equal hits to number of groups but\n-    // we also have a\n-    // remainder that is equal to or greater than group size,\n-    // THEN we need to make sure to pick randomly, and include the remainder group.
