To test\n+this, start a game without any changes, host. Then in another instance, make\n+changes, launch, and connect to the host and play the game through to a combat round.\n+That should test most functionality to verify network compatibility\n+1.

For example split bug fixes from refactoring\n+- Favor PRs that are short and easy to review, under two hundred lines\n+- PRs should not stay open for a long time, if they are not merge-ready, or will not be within a few\n+days, close and re-open them when they are ready.\n+\n+### PR Merge Guidelines\n+At least one code reviewer must:\n+- try out any functional changes", "originalCommit": "c7c0831a27c6160500b0ae08d49ca497440fa8f1", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5MTcxMjg3MQ==", "url": "https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/pull/7715#discussion_r491712871", "bodyText": "Codacy found an issue: [ordered-list-marker-value] Marker should be 2, was 1", "author": "DanVanAtta", "createdAt": "2020-09-20T17:23:21Z", "path": ".github/CONTRIBUTING.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -1,17 +1,67 @@\n-## General\n-We are all just humans and we all make mistakes, but please be polite in conversations, and follow the golden rule.\n-\n-## Pull Requests\n-We appreciate every new developer who wants to contribute to the TripleA project.\n-If you want to create a Pull Request, please make sure your PR matches our requirements:\n- 1.

To test\n+this, start a game without any changes, host. Then in another instance, make\n+changes, launch, and connect to the host and play the game through to a combat round.\n+That should test most functionality to verify network compatibility\n+1.
