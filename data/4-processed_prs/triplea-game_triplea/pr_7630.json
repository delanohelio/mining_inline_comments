If the \"XOR\" is still supported and it is not deprecated, then all the items about converting \"XOR\" to \"1\" should be removed from the document.\nThe reason why I suggested to remove the \"XOR\" is that \"XOR\" means \"1\", as long as the conditions are 2 or more (I don't know what's going to happen if you have \"XOR\" and 1 or 0 conditions (logically, you should never have \"XOR\" with less than 2 conditions), but I assume it is still the same as having \"1\"). Therefore, the \"XOR\" value is completely useless, as you can use \"1\" instead of it. I also suppose not everyone knows what \"XOR\" means, especially since in English \"or\" is normally supposed to be exclusive (\"You can have this or that for 1 pound\" doesn't mean you can have both).", "author": "Cernelius", "createdAt": "2020-09-12T21:30:35Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4NzQ0NjY0NQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4NzQ1MTg0NQ==", "url": "https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/pull/7630#discussion_r487451845", "bodyText": "Thanks for the response here. Yeah, I think removing the XOR mention for now is best until we can clarify it.
