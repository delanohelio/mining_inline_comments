Otherwise who is to say that the actual object behaves that way, in which case the test is not testing anything. For example, if I mock a DB layer to return 5 results from a select, I need to take the real DB and assert that given that select I get 5 results. Otherwise if the real DB throws a syntax error or otherwise, and all I have done is mocked it, then I'll have a bug that the test papered-over and was not sufficient enough to test (so either use a real object or create another test to verify the behavior that was mocked in the orignal test).\n\nTo fix the above, one can often transform the object under test to be a function and then have the caller pass the result to the void method call. So in production code, our original example is this:\nnew ClassUnderTest(new StrategyObject()).voidCall(\"some arg\");\n\nInstead you can transform that into:\nvar result = ClassUnderTest().computeSomething(\"some arg\");\nnew StrategyObject().sideEffect(result);\n\nNow, you can test ClassUnderTest without mocks and you can still test StrategyObject just as you would have before.\nIf things are really coupled then a half step that helps is:\n\nClassUnderTest(new ArgTransformFunction(), new StrategyObject()  ).voidCall(\"some arg\");\n\n// where ArgTransformFunction = \"some arg\" -> \"some computation\"\n\nWith that latter the test for ClassUnderTest is completely with mocks. Which is good as all the variation is under your control and you can still test \"new ArgTransformFunction()\" and \"new StrategyObject()\" independently. In these cases you are roughly able to remove the verify invocations.\nNow, how difficult it would be to do such a transformation is a question. The arg conversion strategy can often be injected as a '@VisibleForTest' constructor and this way you move the interesting code under test to its own unit that you can test in isolation without mocks.\n\nBeyond the above, something I was thinking about, I'd recommend building some harness or characterization tests. I suspect tests that would help most in the restructuring would have setups like \"given a sub, and a v2 transport\", assert that the executable stack has \"first-strike attack and defender return fire\".", "author": "DanVanAtta", "createdAt": "2020-09-09T03:10:34Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4NTI2MzQwOQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4NTMxNTMxMA==", "url": "https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/pull/7576#discussion_r485315310", "bodyText": "Understood.

You'll have a lot more confidence that you have not introduced any bugs and because you'll have test coverage you won't have to add unit tests at every step of the way. It's always risky doing the latter approach as it's hard to know if you are unit testing buggy code and thereby asserting defective behavior.", "author": "DanVanAtta", "createdAt": "2020-09-09T05:19:55Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4NTI2MzQwOQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4NTM0NDc2OA==", "url": "https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/pull/7576#discussion_r485344768", "bodyText": "Phrased another way, what exactly are we testing here?

DisplayName on test and comments in the assertion and in verifications woud help with that.\nTests are great, but a double edged sword as they can become slow and a point of maintenance. When a test fails, the first questions are: \"what was this testing?\" and \"why was this test valid?\". If those questions take a lot of time to determine, and it's just one of a dozen tests to fix, then there is substantial cost to change code. Hence, it's very important that tests are overly verbose in what they are testing and why we expect them to be correct and pass.
