There are cases where the payload of a 200 is an error message, ie: the message and service are all okay, everything happened as expected, but something resulted in an error.\nIn this case though, the message string is quite exact, keeps it quite simple. (For example, a close from server very well could be a 200, which would look like the same if the client closed)", "author": "DanVanAtta", "createdAt": "2020-04-14T00:51:45Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwNzc0MjE4Mw=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}]}
