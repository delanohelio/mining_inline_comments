I think it is analgous to this:\n   doPrinting(Connection c);\n}\n\nvoid doPrinting(Connection c) {\n     if(c.connected) {\n          sendToFax();\n     }\n}\n\nvs:\n\nif(c.connected()) {\n  sendToFax();\n}\n\nAnd with an if/else branch:\n   doPrinting(Connection c);\n}\n\nprivate void doPrinting(Connection c) {\n     if(c.connected) {\n          sendToFax();\n     } else {\n          sendToCopier();\n    }\n}\n\nIn the above, you can see it is just as well to have the if/else statement at the higher level. I think it also comes back to trying to favor having control flow in one place, at a high level, then keep the private methods that are invoked to be functional.\nLast comment, when a no-op method, or a method is carved off with control-flow, it often means the abstraction is cut at a slightly awkward level. The method is not quite control flow, not quite functional. Either the method should do more control flow and invoke other methods, or it should be just the body of the if statement.

It violates the \"yoda\" principle: \"Do or do not, there is no try\".\nSpecifically here:\n    if (retreatTo == null) {\n      return;\n    }\n\nIn this case we have a 'retreat' method that is only conditionally doing a retreat.  If the method says 'retreat', I would expect it to do an unconditional retreat.\nIn this case I would do similar and push the control flow up a level so that this method has a SRP to it and does \"retreat\".

Now if you get to 'retreat', you actually know that is executed and is not yet more control flow and potentially a no-op.\nIt makes the retreat method much more cohesive too IMHO:\n  private void retreat(final IDelegateBridge bridge, final Retreater retreater, final Territory retreatTo) {\n    final Collection<Unit> retreatUnits = retreater.getRetreatUnits();\n\n    SoundUtils.playRetreatType(\n        battleState.getAttacker(), retreatUnits, retreater.getRetreatType(), bridge);\n\n    final CompositeChange change = new CompositeChange();\n   :\n   :\n\nI would probably go on to rewrite the retreat method as follows:\n  private void retreat(final IDelegateBridge bridge, final Retreater retreater, final Territory retreatTo) {\n    final Collection<Unit> retreatUnits = retreater.getRetreatUnits();\n\n    SoundUtils.playRetreatType(\n        battleState.getAttacker(), retreatUnits, retreater.getRetreatType(), bridge);\n\n    bridge.addChange(computeRetreatChange(...));\n    \n    if (battleState.getUnits(BattleState.Side.OFFENSE).isEmpty()) {\n      battleActions.endBattle(IBattle.WhoWon.DEFENDER, bridge);\n    } else {\n      bridge.getDisplayChannelBroadcaster().notifyRetreat(battleState.getBattleId(), retreatUnits);\n    }\n\n    bridge\n        .getDisplayChannelBroadcaster()\n        .notifyRetreat(\n            battleState.getAttacker().getName() + retreater.getShortBroadcastSuffix(),\n            battleState.getAttacker().getName() + retreater.getLongBroadcastSuffix(retreatTo),\n            getName(),\n            battleState.getAttacker());\n  }\n\nI think I woudl stop there for rewriting that method since you really need to then pivot functionality out of the bridge and I think it hits diminishing returns..\nIDK if this was overly pedantic for you, hopefully helpful maybe for some ideas, WDYT @trevan ?", "author": "DanVanAtta", "createdAt": "2020-09-24T02:25:31Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5Mzk4MjQ4Nw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5NDAxOTI4MQ==", "url": "https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/pull/7723#discussion_r494019281", "bodyText": "I've reworked it.", "author": "trevan", "createdAt": "2020-09-24T03:40:05Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5Mzk4MjQ4Nw=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5Mzk4MjY2Ng==", "url": "https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/pull/7723#discussion_r493982666", "bodyText": "nit, good place for a ternary here.
