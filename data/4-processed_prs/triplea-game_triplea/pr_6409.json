Testing\n  revealed that timestamps returned from those tables were in local\n  time, these were all changed to be 'timestamptz' to keep all times\n  in UTC (the only non-UTC times should be when we are displaying a\n  last-mile date value to a user, otherwise we want all UTC or epoch\n  millis everywhere else).", "committedDate": "2020-05-06T01:19:36Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyMTgyNzc1MA==", "url": "https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/pull/6409#discussion_r421827750", "bodyText": "Are old chat messages ever deleted?\nIf not I'm concerned that we'll run out of disk space very quickly \ud83e\udd14", "author": "RoiEXLab", "createdAt": "2020-05-07T22:20:17Z", "path": "http-server/src/main/java/org/triplea/db/dao/moderator/chat/history/GameChatHistoryDao.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,24 @@\n+package org.triplea.db.dao.moderator.chat.history;\n+\n+import java.util.List;\n+import org.jdbi.v3.sqlobject.customizer.Bind;\n+import org.jdbi.v3.sqlobject.statement.SqlQuery;\n+\n+/**\n+ * DAO to access history of in-game chat messages stored in database.
