Unfortunate.\nEven though this PR is already merged I have some concerns.\nThis is a parallel Stream, so we could end up running into concurrency issues because the now unsynchronized map doesn't have a wrapper for this kind of protection.\nAlso somewhere down the line we give this exact map away without any sort of write protection, which might introduce weird bugs if we modify it somewhere by accident.\nI was able to come up with 4 potential solutions to this:\n\nJust wrap it in a Collections.synchronizedMap package and return an unmodifiable collection wrapper int the API (I forgot where this was, but I removed it in my PR), the easiest solution but might hurt parallel performance and adds unecessary abstraction.\nDo it in 2 steps. We could use the streams and everything to put all of the entry objects in an unmodifiable List and use a normal for-each loop to fill a map, and all we store is the unmodifiable wrapper to this map. Easy solution, but still not optimal use of streams IMO.\nSame as 2. but instead of using for-each we use the same collector as before and iterate over all elements until we find the correct key in case we find a conflicting value. Still weird, but works as well.\nProvide a custom collector. Instead of using the default Collectors#toUnmodifiableMap we could provide our own \"implementation\". The Collector interface offers some handy static functions for this.\nThis would add some complexity:\n\nCollector.of(\n  HashMap::new,\n  (map, entry) -> {\n    // Alternative approach would be to use Map#containsKey\n    if (map.put(entry.getKey(), entry.getValue()) != null) {\n      log.log(Level.INFO, \"Duplicate key: \" + entry.getKey());\n    }\n  },\n  (map1, map2) -> {\n    for (final var entry : m2.entrySet()) {\n      // Variant two, as described earlier\n      if (map1.containsKey(entry.getKey())) {\n        log.log(Level.INFO, \"Duplicate key: \" + entry.getKey());\n      }\n      map1.put(entry.getKey(), entry.getValue())\n    }\n    return m1;\n  },\n  Collections::unmodifiableMap,\n  // Optional but for the sake of completeness\n  Collector.Characteristics.UNORDERED);\nThe only thing I don't like about approach 4 is that it duplicates the detection logic, but this could be solved by extracting it to a private static helper method, so it would look like this:\nCollector.of(\n  HashMap::new,\n  (map, entry) -> putAndWarn(map, entry.getKey(), entry.getValue()),\n  (map1, map2) -> {\n    for (final var entry : map2.entrySet()) {\n      putAndWarn(map1, entry.getKey(), entry.getValue());\n    }\n    return map1;\n  },\n  Collections::unmodifiableMap,\n  // Optional but for the sake of completeness\n  Collector.Characteristics.UNORDERED);\nWhat do you think? I leaning towards option 4 simply because I think it's the most consistent way to do it.", "author": "RoiEXLab", "createdAt": "2020-07-11T18:49:41Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ1MjgyOTI2MA=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}]}
