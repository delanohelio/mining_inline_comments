It does look you misread it.  This is testing the case where a single transporter is converted into two transporters.  The unit being transported (the infantry) needs to go to one of the new transporters.  It doesn't make sense for the infantry to be in both of the transports and the code doesn't allow it either.\nAs for the question of what happens if a transported unit gets changed?  I don't know.  Currently, they are always killed.  Reason for that is that when a transported unit is killed, it is done after units are transformed.  And a transported unit currently can't be damaged.
