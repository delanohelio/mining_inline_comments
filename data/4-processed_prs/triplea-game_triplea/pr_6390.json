It could be that using a null parent component is always 'safer' even if the pop-up is not centered.\nThe assigning to a variable for a null value for the sake of adding a label is a bit old style compared to using a builder or something similar. In IDEA with the parameters being labelled it's far less useful, though still debatable as some would argue that the code should be understandable even if you are not using an IDE (which means you can infer what the variables are by looking at the usage and not have to look at the method definition).", "author": "DanVanAtta", "createdAt": "2020-05-05T17:57:45Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyMDA1NzYyNA=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}]}
