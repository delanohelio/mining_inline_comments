The questions/answers in a PR are of very low value because they are ephemeral. It is a sad day when you have to start looking through PRs to understand the code as written.\nWith that all aside, let's optimize our setup instructions for someone getting setup. I don't know if there is any value in setting up a project-specific config without having the project checked out. The easiest way to start is to clone, then open IDEA, \"open\" > select the 'build.gradle' file, then IDEA will automatically add triplea as a gradle roject. From there, the checkstyle config is project specific, specific to TripleA and AFAIK you really need to have the project set up to configure that.", "author": "DanVanAtta", "createdAt": "2020-11-09T00:51:10Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxOTIzMDk1Mw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxOTUzODI3Mw==", "url": "https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/pull/8120#discussion_r519538273", "bodyText": "@DanVanAtta First, did i do this new commit correctly, and second, if it worked, is that kind of what you were thinking?", "author": "CharlieAtlas", "createdAt": "2020-11-09T03:47:00Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxOTIzMDk1Mw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyMDIzOTM5OQ==", "url": "https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/pull/8120#discussion_r520239399", "bodyText": "Looks good, close enough \ud83d\udc4d", "author": "DanVanAtta", "createdAt": "2020-11-10T02:07:21Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxOTIzMDk1Mw=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "682e60bec6f633e80dc9760907fdfd5350199feb", "url": "https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/commit/682e60bec6f633e80dc9760907fdfd5350199feb", "message": "Intellij setup clear up checkstyle info", "committedDate": "2020-11-09T03:42:50Z", "type": "commit"}]}
