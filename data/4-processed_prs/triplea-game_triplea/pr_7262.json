In this case when the game stops,\nfor bots, all seats will still be occupied, the game will\nnot actually be running, and users joining will get a \"game is\nlaunching, try joining later\" message. This is a dead-state\nfor bots as the seats are full, cannot be emptied, and a game\nis not actually running. This update resolves that situation\nby resetting games if there any errors on load.\n\nOf note, it's critical the game would reach the 'launch' functionality\nto clear the 'isLaunching' flag. If we terminate earlier then the\ngame would be stuck in a 'isLaunching' state.", "committedDate": "2020-07-27T00:00:42Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2MDU5MTI0NA==", "url": "https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/pull/7262#discussion_r460591244", "bodyText": "Codacy found an issue: Too many fields", "author": "DanVanAtta", "createdAt": "2020-07-27T00:08:22Z", "path": "game-core/src/main/java/games/strategy/engine/framework/startup/launcher/ServerLauncher.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -23,19 +23,17 @@\n import java.util.Collections;\n import java.util.List;\n import java.util.Map;\n-import java.util.Optional;\n import java.util.Set;\n import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch;\n import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;\n import java.util.logging.Level;\n-import javax.annotation.Nullable;\n import lombok.extern.java.Log;\n import org.triplea.java.Interruptibles;\n import org.triplea.lobby.common.GameDescription;\n \n /** Implementation of {@link ILauncher} for a headed or headless network server game. */\n @Log\n-public class ServerLauncher extends AbstractLauncher<Void> {\n+public class ServerLauncher implements ILauncher {", "originalCommit": "13a4dd25cc50a737ef1a0b2bc3b584425fc55b74", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}]}
