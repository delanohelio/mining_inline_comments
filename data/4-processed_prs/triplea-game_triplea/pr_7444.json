Essentially when a game starts, you could select \"V1\" or \"V3\" rules for example, or you could drill down into specific rules and turn them on/off individually before starting a game. For this we need the rules to become modular, for game code that accesses these rules to be calling out to a game rule strategy, or module, and for the rules to be well tested within themselves.\n+* **Improvements to map making tools and bringing them in-game**\n+The map making tools are not ideal in a number ways, a bit clunky. We're looking for these tools to be brought into the game itself with the goal of maps being an upload process from a file menu option. The idea is a player could enter a 'map-edit' mode, change parameters and the map itself from within the game, save it as a new map, then upload the map.", "originalCommit": "11673dc1d2679e2fbd940753c6a85e943fb3e41e", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ3NTMxNDU2OQ==", "url": "https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/pull/7444#discussion_r475314569", "bodyText": "Lists should be surrounded by blank lines", "author": "codeclimate", "createdAt": "2020-08-24T02:49:23Z", "path": "docs/development/areas-of-need.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,28 @@\n+# Areas of Need\n+\n+This page is a list of items that are needed from a code/development perspective.
