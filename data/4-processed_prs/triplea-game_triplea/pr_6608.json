On one hand GC should kick in and at least destroy the array and at some point the memory would be overwritten.\nFor the most part it's a \"use char[] where convenient\", so don't go out of our way to use String. In this case overall I think/hope there is less conversion to string, ultimately simpler. To another extent, because we are reading password in from CLI args, coming in as a String[], we are pretty boned in terms of the password being stored as a String", "author": "DanVanAtta", "createdAt": "2020-06-07T03:04:58Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzNjMxOTIzNQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}]}
