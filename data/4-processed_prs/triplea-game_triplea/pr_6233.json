Though, reaching out to another class to grab data to be used in a local computation is also a code smell as well.\nI think a third approach, extracting the support method and the support cache to a new class so that it does not live in either DiceRoll nor UnitTypeList is probably the way to go. I can see that being too much for the scope of this update.\nI'd be most comfortable if we had the support rules stay local to DiceRoll for now, or going with the expanded scope route.\nOne concern is for serialization, as a GameDataComponent the UnitTypeList will be serialized to disk. That means after this update, any save game will require the support set field to be present, moving it later will break save-game compatibility.
