It doesn\u2019t support cell colors or text formatting. \n \n ## Data types\n \n Each piece of information (each cell) in OpenRefine is assigned a data type. Some file formats, when imported, can set data types that are recognized by OpenRefine. Cells without an associated data type on import will be considered a \u201cstring\u201d at first, but you can have OpenRefine convert cell contents into other data types later.

You\u2019ll see numbers change from black text to green if they are recognized.\n \n The data type will determine what you can do with the value. For example, if you want to add two values together, they must both be recognized as the number type. \n \n You can check data types at any time by:\n *   clicking \u201cedit\u201d on a single cell (where you can also edit the type)\n-*   creating a Custom Text Facet on a column, and inserting `type(value)` into the \u201cExpression\u201d field.

For example, using a column-wide transform such as <span class=\"menuItems\">Transform</span> \u2192 <span class=\"menuItems\">Common transforms</span> \u2192 <span class=\"menuItems\">To date</span> may not convert all values successfully, but going to an individual cell, clicking \u201cedit\u201d, and changing the data type can successfully convert text to a date.
