That probably should have been a signal for me to ask Antonin or someone else (who was still newish to our team), but I think that discussion did eventually happen between him and Antonin in the contributing PRs and original issues for Java Date that he worked on.  I recall Instant and Locale being 2 terms he asked me about concerning expectations and I didn't have enough Java expertise.  I don't think an opportunity was missed regarding the new Java Date support, instead I just don't think we gave Jacky the right info about our expectations that he was asking of all of us at the time. :-(  After all, he did work for Citi at the time and maintained international date structures in databases and code for them.
