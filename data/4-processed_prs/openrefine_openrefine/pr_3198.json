CS&S is a USA based organization qualified as exempt from federal income tax under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and classified as a public charity under IRC Sections 509(a)(1) and 170(b)(1)(A)(vi). \n+\n+### Manage Funds \n+\n+While the vast majority of OpenRefine contributors are volunteers, we recognized that need to attract and retain contributors to either\n+- perform time critical maintenance tasks for the project (for example release management, security update, pull request review and comments)\n+- address issue that will not be naturally done by the communittee (for example documentation or on long terms project like OpenRefine 4.x)\n+\n+CS&S currently manage the current funding sources: \n+- **Grants**: Funds are allocated based on the grants requierements. Grants help to secure resources to achieve long term goal or supports software maintenance, growth, development, and community engagement.\n+- **Google Summer of Code**: Google Summer of Code mentors are eligible to a USD 500 compensation for their work. \n+- **Donations made through Github sponsors or done directly to CS&S on behalf of OpenRefine**: Usage of the fund is made by the Advisory committee with guidance from Organization Members. \n+\n+The CS&S, the Steering and Advisory comittees have experience applying and managing grants. If you are interested in applying to a grant to improve OpenRefine, please share your idea early on the Developer mailing list. It will be a pleasure helping you through your grant application. New grants must be approved by the Advisory Committee. that CS&S retains a 15% handling fees on any contribution to finance their operations (20% for government funding). \n+\n+### Other assets \n \n-This document is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0.](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/)\n-This work is based upon [\"Meritocratic Governance Model\"](http://www.oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/meritocraticGovernanceModel) by University of Oxford, the [OWIN Project Governance model](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mn3dY6zNyKBU3P_TWoR-RdYpScJDbsXU2TRhwpSAha8) and guidelines available for the [Apache Community](http://community.apache.org).\n+CS&S owns and manage the domain openrefine.org ", "originalCommit": "6d9be0c617a0df0f2b627d26a262ff5f054532f3", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5MjA3MTI3OQ==", "url": "https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/pull/3198#discussion_r492071279", "bodyText": "Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n            It is composed of at least three members.
