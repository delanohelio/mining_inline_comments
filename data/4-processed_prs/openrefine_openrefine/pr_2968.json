Get the database type (such as MySQL), database name, and the URL (either an IP address, such as `127.0.0.1`, or the domain that uses the database, such as _https://openrefine.org/category/blog.html_). Then look at the accounts authorized for access. You may wish to create a new account just for OpenRefine, or add OpenRefine to an existing account. \n-\n-Each host will have a slightly different method, but generally speaking: look for \u201caccounts with access\u201d to the database you wish to authorize, and within the settings for that account, look for \u201callowable hosts\u201d or \u201caccess hosts.\u201d \n-\n-In that list, add the IP address of your own computer, because that is where the OpenRefine access request will be coming from. You can find this easily, by clicking \u201cTest\u201d within OpenRefine once the rest of the information is filled out: OpenRefine will give you an error that looks like \n-\n-``` error:Access denied for user 'yourusername'@'123-45-67-89.yourISP.com' ```\n+If you have a downloaded database (`.db`) file from an SQLite database, you can supply the path to the file on your computer directly in the \u201cDatabase\u201d field at the bottom of the form. You can leave the rest of the fields blank.\n \n-Take your IP address from this error message and put that, with periods instead of hyphens, into the \u201callowable hosts\u201d field on the account you\u2019re trying to use. Add a wildcard to the end of your IP address (\u201c123.45.67.89%\u201d). Save that setting, and then test the connection again with OpenRefine.\n+To import data directly from a database online, you will need the database type (such as MySQL), database name, and the hostname (either an IP address, such as `127.0.0.1`, or the domain that uses the database) and the port on the host. You will need an account authorized for access, and you may need to add OpenRefine (connecting from your computer\u2019s IP) to the \u201callowable hosts\u201d for that account.", "originalCommit": "3eb4b4d83ede06f7653aa9809f09b4854f3df278", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ1OTU3NjY4NQ==", "url": "https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/pull/2968#discussion_r459576685", "bodyText": "Sorry another picky point - \"database online\" in the first sentence should be \"database\" - the question of whether the database is online or not doesn't affect the connection (it could be running locally on the users computer)", "author": "ostephens", "createdAt": "2020-07-23T16:28:51Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ1OTU2NzY1NQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ1OTU3NzAxOA==", "url": "https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/pull/2968#discussion_r459577018", "bodyText": "@ostephens one way to express that is to say \"NOTE: Firewall rules and your Database networking rules might require configuration to allow the egress IP of where OpenRefine is hosted to connect to the ingress IP of your database\"", "author": "thadguidry", "createdAt": "2020-07-23T16:29:27Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ1OTU2NzY1NQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2MTg4NjE3OA==", "url": "https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/pull/2968#discussion_r461886178", "bodyText": "I wasn't crazy about \"ingress/egress\" :) but everything else here is incorporated now.", "author": "allanaaa", "createdAt": "2020-07-28T21:19:42Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ1OTU2NzY1NQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ1OTU2OTcwMw==", "url": "https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/pull/2968#discussion_r459569703", "bodyText": "\"If Google\" should be \"If OpenRefine\"", "author": "ostephens", "createdAt": "2020-07-23T16:17:46Z", "path": "docs/docs/manual/starting.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -157,7 +126,7 @@ Once OpenRefine is ready to import the data, you will see a screen with \u201cConfi\n \n At the bottom of the screen you will find options for telling OpenRefine how to process what it has found.
