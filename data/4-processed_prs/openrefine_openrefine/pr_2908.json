[Installation and upgrade instructions are below](#install-or-upgrade-java). \n+\n+\n+#### Compatible Browser\n+\n+OpenRefine works best on browsers based on Webkit, such as:\n+\n+\n+\n+*   Google Chrome\n+*   Chromium\n+*   Opera\n+*   Microsoft Edge\n+\n+We are aware of some minor rendering and performance issues on other browsers such as Firefox. We don't support Internet Explorer. If you are having issues running OpenRefine, see the [section on Running](running.md#troubleshooting).\n \n \n ### Release versions\n \n+OpenRefine always has a latest stable release as well as some more recent work available in beta, release candidate, or nightly release versions. \n+\n+If you are installing for the first time, we recommend [the latest stable release](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/releases/latest). \n+\n+If you wish to use an extension that is only compatible with an earlier version of OpenRefine, and do not require the latest features, you may find that [an older stable version is best for you](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/releases) in our list of releases. Look at later releases to see which vulnerabilities are being fixed, in order to assess your own risk tolerance for using earlier versions. Look for \u201cfinal release\u201d versions instead of \u201cbeta\u201d or \u201crelease candidate\u201d versions.\n+\n+\n+#### Unstable versions\n+\n+If you need a recently developed function, and are willing to risk some untested code, you can look at [the most recent items in the reverse-chronological list](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/releases) and see what changes appeal to you. \n+\n+\u201cBeta\u201d and \u201crelease candidate\u201d versions may both have unreported bugs and are most suitable for people who are wiling to help us troubleshoot these versions by [creating bug reports](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues).  \n+\n+For the absolute latest development updates, see the [snapshot releases](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine-nightly-releases/releases). These are created with every commit. \n+\n+\n+#### What\u2019s Changed \n+\n+Our [latest release is at the time of writing is OpenRefine 3.4](link goes here!), released XXXX XX 2020. The major changes in this version are listed on the [3.4 final release page](link goes here!) with the downloadable packages. \n+\n+\n+\n+:::note\n+\n+[This link always goes to the actual latest release](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/releases/latest), whether this user manual is updated or not. \n+\n+:::\n \n+You can find information about all of our releases on the [Releases page on Github](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/releases).\n \n-*   What\u2019s Changed (a plain language summary of major improvements only)\n-*   Layman explainer of beta, RC, and final\n-    *   Beta\n-    *   Development version\n-        *   [Nightly releases](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine-nightly-releases/releases)\n-*   [Changelogs feed](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/releases)\n-*   Other distributions\n+\n+:::tip Other distributions\n+\n+Our community of contributors may have created a version of OpenRefine that works for you. Look at the list of \u201cOther Distributions\u201d on our [Download page]([https://openrefine.org/download.html](https://openrefine.org/download.html)).\n+\n+:::\n \n \n ## Installing or upgrading\n \n \n ### Back up your data\n \n+If you are upgrading from an older version of OpenRefine and have projects already on your computer, you should create backups of those projects before you install a new version.\n \n+First, [locate your workspace directory](#where-is-data-stored). Then copy everything you find there and paste it into a folder elsewhere on your computer. \n \n-*   Windows\n-*   Mac\n-*   Linux\n+For extra security you can [export your existing OpenRefine projects](exporting.md#export-a-project). \n \n \n-### Install/Upgrade\n+:::caution\n \n+Take note of the [extensions](#installing-extensions) you have currently installed. They may not be compatible with the upgraded version of OpenRefine. Installations can be installed in two places, so be sure to check both your workspace directory and the existing installation directory.
