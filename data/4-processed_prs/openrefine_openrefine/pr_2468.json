My Cross is not working for some unknown reason\".\nToday:\nAnd what we have found out over time is that lookup failures are OK for users to experience, because there are lots of reasons why a cross() might fail to perform the lookup correctly due to the data quality.  For instance, any one of these kinds of errors.  So, I think we can relax the cross() completely as you suggest and have less defensive coding here for cross().\nFuture:\nInstead, we should ensure that we have much better error output for the failures of cross().  For instance, when applying a GREL expression, users have a radio button option to store error and that's where we could have cross() produce much more informative errors about the cross lookup failure similar to how other data tools work as seen in that hyperlink provided.  With that idea, I could see where users might want an enhancement for cross() to have a new boolean option for \"exact match with data type\"", "author": "thadguidry", "createdAt": "2020-03-24T15:05:44Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5NzE3MTQ5Mg=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5NzY3MTcxMw==", "url": "https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/pull/2468#discussion_r397671713", "bodyText": "Correct, any valid cell type.\n\nI'm also for anytype.
