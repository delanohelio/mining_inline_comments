But the docs never were updated, in my case, under the assumption that it would be fixed quickly. Since it wasn't fixed quickly (understandably given what the fix involves) I see a steady stream of users like @ozirissp who run into all sorts of trouble. Even worse are those Alexa and GA users who try to expose their Items for that integration needlessly, accomplishing nothing beyond exacerbating the problem which caused it to be turned off in the first place. My thought was to add the warning about not exposing Items for Alexa and GA and that it's currently turned off, and then when it gets turned back on to update the docs again.", "author": "rkoshak", "createdAt": "2020-04-24T16:32:16Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQxNDYxOTYzOA=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQxNDYzODA2Nw==", "url": "https://github.com/openhab/openhab-addons/pull/7446#discussion_r414638067", "bodyText": "Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n            You should not expose items in this way for Alexa or Google Assistant.\n          \n          \n            \n            This setting has no affect on Alexa or Google Assistant functionality.", "author": "digitaldan", "createdAt": "2020-04-24T14:52:37Z", "path": "bundles/org.openhab.io.openhabcloud/README.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -35,8 +35,10 @@ After installing this add-on, you will find configuration options in the Paper U\n \n ![Configuration](contrib/doc/cfg.png)\n \n-Please note, that you don't need to expose all your items in this settings dialog.\n-You just need to expose those items, which you want to be accessible by a third party service.\n+Please note, that you should not expose all your items in this settings dialog.\n+Also note that at present this feature is currently turned off.\n+You just need to expose those items, which you want to be accessible by IFTTT.\n+You should not expose items in this way for Alexa or Google Assistant.", "originalCommit": "86247cb37791b431ad46ea9b83b13893f101ccd4", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "615ba1ea305dff9a5ca4bd0a67e2a1b64126e95c", "url": "https://github.com/openhab/openhab-addons/commit/615ba1ea305dff9a5ca4bd0a67e2a1b64126e95c", "message": "Update bundles/org.openhab.io.openhabcloud/README.md\r\n\r\nAccepting Dan's rewording suggestion.\n\nCo-Authored-By: Dan Cunningham <dan@digitaldan.com>", "committedDate": "2020-04-24T15:06:37Z", "type": "commit"}]}
