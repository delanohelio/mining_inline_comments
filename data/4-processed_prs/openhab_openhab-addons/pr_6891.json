Inspiration for this enhancement came from the\ndiscussion here:\nhttps://community.openhab.org/t/lgwebos-binding-sendbutton-question/85872/8\n\nHere is a list of IR codes that I have found to work. Note that\nthis list has been compiled mostly through trial and error, and\nI may have missed some of the buttons. I have only been able to\ntest this on an LGUJ657A TV so your mileage may vary.\n\nCode String\tDescription\nLEFT\tLeft button in cursor control group\nRIGHT\tRight button in cursor control group\nUP\tUp button in cursor control group\nDOWN\tDown button in cursor control group\nENTER\t\"OK\" button in the center of the cursor control group\nBACK\t\"BACK\" button\nEXIT\t\"EXIT\" button\n0-9\tNumber buttons\nHOME\t\"HOME\" button\nRED\t\"RED\" button\nGREEN\t\"GREEN\" button\nYELLOW\t\"YELLOW\" button\nBLUE\t\"BLUE\" button\nPLAY\t\"PLAY\" button\nPAUSE\t\"PAUSE\" button\nSTOP\t\"STOP\" button\nA sample HABPanel remote control widget can be found in this github\nrepository: https://github.com/bbrodt/openhab2-misc\n\nSigned-off-by: Bob Brodt <rbrodt@gmail.com>", "committedDate": "2020-01-22T19:45:57Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3MDk1NDc1Mg==", "url": "https://github.com/openhab/openhab-addons/pull/6891#discussion_r370954752", "bodyText": "Please remove empty comment", "author": "J-N-K", "createdAt": "2020-01-25T20:41:46Z", "path": "bundles/org.openhab.binding.lgwebos/src/main/java/org/openhab/binding/lgwebos/internal/handler/LGWebOSTVSocket.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -811,6 +811,14 @@ public void onError(String error) {\n \n     }\n \n+    // Simulate Remote Control Button press\n+\n+    public void sendRCButton(String rcButton, ResponseListener<CommandConfirmation> listener) {\n+        executeMouse(s -> s.button(rcButton));\n+    }\n+\n+    //", "originalCommit": "f2f4ec6ee0843ab1f666a34f353755d3dfb0be2c", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3MDk1NDg4MA==", "url": "https://github.com/openhab/openhab-addons/pull/6891#discussion_r370954880", "bodyText": "Please add an empty line after a markdown header", "author": "J-N-K", "createdAt": "2020-01-25T20:44:39Z", "path": "bundles/org.openhab.binding.lgwebos/README.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -62,6 +62,33 @@ Thing lgwebos:WebOSTV:tv1 [host=\"192.168.2.119\", key=\"6ef1dff6c7c936c8dc5056fc85\n | mediaPlayer     | Player    | Media control player                                                                                                                                                                                                    | W          |\n | mediaStop       | Switch    | Media control stop                                                                                                                                                                                                      | W          |\n | appLauncher     | String    | Application ID of currently running application.
