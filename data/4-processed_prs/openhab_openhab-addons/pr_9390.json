Go to Settings:DEVICE NAME and select a symbolic name.\n+This name will also discovered by the binding and added as a suffix to the thing name in the Inbox.\n+It simplifies to identify the roller when you have a ton of Shelly things (believe me).\n+\n+### Shelly setup - Positioning Favorites\n+\n+With version 1.9 Alterco introduced an interesting feature called Favorites.\n+Those allow to store up to 4 pre-defined positions in the device, e.g. 15%, 50%, 65%, 98%.\n+Once defined you have kind of a short-cut to bring the roller to that position and those favorites are also supported by the binding (see below).\n+\n+![](images/uiroller_fav1.png)   ![](images/uiroller_fav2.png)\n+   \n+To use this feature open the device's Web UI and click on Favorites(+) button.\n+You could now specify 4 percentage values between 0% (closed) and 100% (open).\n+Enter the values and try using the button line above the roller control and main UI buttons.\n+\n+With this configuration your Shelly is ready to be integrated into openHAB.\n+\n+### Binding/Thing configuration\n+\n+Once the Shelly is configured you could start the discovery within openHAB.\n+Important: If you want to password protect your Shellys (strong recommendation) you could set a default user/password in the binding settings and avoid to specify those per thing:\n+- Open PaperUI:Configuration:Binding\n+- Set User Id and Password, save\n+- Remove all Shellys from the Inbox (if any)\n+- and restart the Discovery\n+\n+![](images/uiroller_rlogin.png) \n+\n+Now all Shellys should pop up with the correct device names and types.\n+The binding also adds some information to the Thing Name making the identification easier.\n+\n+Once you added the device from the Inbox the binding will initialize the device and dynamically create channels depending on the available device/firmware features.\n+This takes about 5-10 seconds.\n+During that time the thing is working, but you might miss channels in the UI - that's normal, try to reload the page after 10sec and boom all there.\n+Go to the channel overview and links the channels you want to use, refer to the README to get more details on channels, type and values.\n+\n+The only thing to configure are the positioning favorite ids for the roller UP and DOWN commands.\n+Edit the thing configuration and select the ids in the corresponding entry fields.\n+Value 0 means: no favorite, value 1-4 select the position as defined in the Shelly App.\n+There is also a dedicated channel (roller#rollerFav), which accepts this ids and triggers the roller moving to the position (% value) as defined for the matching favorites id.\n+\n+### Device events\n+\n+As you might know the binding supports the Alterco Shelly CoIoT protocol. \n+The device supports so called I/O URL Actions, which are kind of a callback to an application for certain events.\n+Whenever possible you should prefer CoIoT events, because they are triggered near realtime and provide way more information compared to the Action URLs.\n+The binding uses those CoIoT updates as triggers, but also to update the channel data.\n+Refer to the [README](README.md) for more information on CoIoT.\n+\n+### Automation\n+\n+Beside manual operation the binding provide various options to control the roller from within openHAB rules.\n+For example\n+- link channel roller#control and use 'sendCommand(&lt;item&gt;, UP)' to open the shutter or 'sendCommand(&lt;item&gt;, DOWN)' to close it.\n+- get status updates from roller operations by observing channel 'roller#state' and 'roller#stopReason', those report an updated status once the operation is completed\n+- select a position by sending a number value of 100..0 to channel 'roller#rollerpos'\n+- or use the defined favorites by sending favorite id to channel 'roller#rollerFav'\n+- you might set a auto-timer, e.g. one the roller is opened close it again after xx minutes by sending a value to the 'roller#autoOn' or 'roller#autoOff' channels\n+- you could also get the position of the roller from 'roller#control' (by linking a Number item) or the last status from 'roller#state'.\n+Please note that the device only provides update after the roller stops, not during movement so it's not possible to get position updates while the roller is moving.\n+- of course you could time-triggered rules, trigger the shutter depending on sunrise/sunset within openHAB, but also directly on the device\n+\n+## Extending the Use Case\n+\n+There are two valuable options, which even extend and improve the user experience.\n+\n+- Button-1\n+\n+Using the described setup you could add a Button-1 to trigger rules, e.g.\n+- 1xshort: open roller\n+- 2xshort: go to 25% (because disturbs enjoying your morning coffee with your wife)\n+- 3xshort: go to 75% (sun is disturbing while watching your TV)\n+- long   : close shutter (if not done by some automation)\n+\n+- Voice control\n+And of course you could utilize openHAB's voice integration, e.g. with Alexa, Siri or Google Home (who need's Cortana).\n+\n+- Scenes\n+There are more of less limits when integrating even more advanced roller control based on openHAB rules. \n+This allows to provide a scene to the user, which does a lot of complex stuff under the hood.\n+\n+Be welcome to contribute your ideas to the community, this is what creates the difference between openHAB/Shelly setup compared to rollers with button control.\n+\n+### Resources\n+\n+There is a bunch of ressources you could browse around openHAB, Shelly or the binding\n+- Current builds of the binding:\n+Latest **DEV** build: [2.5.11](https://github.com/markus7017/myfiles/blob/master/shelly/org.openhab.binding.shelly-2.5.11-SNAPSHOT.jar?raw=true) -
