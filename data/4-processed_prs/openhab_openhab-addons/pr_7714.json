Let me know if any additional details or proof are needed.\r\n\r\nAdded a table with valid values for some common apps for users' convenience as well as a reference to the log file to find any additionally installed apps.\r\n\r\nSide note: Key codes for remote control simulation might be useful as well since online documentation seems rather weak. I'm happy to contribute as I learn more - just unsure how this should be structured, by TV type or remote type.", "committedDate": "2020-05-21T09:31:24Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyODcyNzc2NQ==", "url": "https://github.com/openhab/openhab-addons/pull/7714#discussion_r428727765", "bodyText": "Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n            | UE50MU6179  | PARTIAL | Supported channels: `volume`, `mute`, `power`, `keyCode`, `channel`, `sourceApp`, `url` (at least)                                                                |\n          \n          \n            \n            | UE50MU6179  | PARTIAL | Supported channels: `volume`, `mute`, `power`, `keyCode`, `channel`, `sourceApp`, `url` |", "author": "J-N-K", "createdAt": "2020-05-21T15:28:03Z", "path": "bundles/org.openhab.binding.samsungtv/README.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -21,6 +21,7 @@ Tested TV models:\n | LE40D579    | PARTIAL | Supported channels: `volume`, `mute`, `channel`, `keyCode`, `sourceName`,  `programTitle`, `channelName`,  `power`                                     |\n | LE40C650    | PARTIAL | Supported channels: `volume`, `mute`, `channel`, `keyCode`, `brightness`, `contrast`, `colorTemperature`, `power` (only power off, unable to power on) |\n | UE55LS003   | PARTIAL | Supported channels: `volume`, `mute`, `sourceApp`, `url`, `keyCode`, `power`, `artMode`                                                                |\n+| UE50MU6179  | PARTIAL | Supported channels: `volume`, `mute`, `power`, `keyCode`, `channel`, `sourceApp`, `url` (at least)                                                                |", "originalCommit": "2a2d6b50381bb55a2c4216472b07d2bb08495b4c", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyODcyODAyMw==", "url": "https://github.com/openhab/openhab-addons/pull/7714#discussion_r428728023", "bodyText": "Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n            List of known apps and the respectve name that can be passed on to the `sourceApp` channel.
