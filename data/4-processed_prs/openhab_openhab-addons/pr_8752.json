to use widgets of which there are now 3 that are discussed on the forum here.\n <https://community.openhab.org/t/custom-widget-camera-clickable-thumbnails-that-open-a-stream/101275>\n \n The widgets in the link above are the easiest way to get an advanced stream working in openHAB and you are welcome to open them up, look at how they work and change them to something even better that suits your needs.\n \n ## Group Displays\n \n-The [Full Example](#full-example) section shows how to setup a group of cameras to be displayed like they are a single camera. \n+The `group` thing allows up to 4 cameras to be displayed like they are a single camera that rotates from one to the next.\n+The display order can be allowed to change if one or more of the cameras detects motion.\n \n-Some additional things to check to get it working are:\n+Some additional checks to get it working are:\n \n + If using the groups HLS feature, the poll time of the group must be the same or less than the total time contained in each cameras m3u8 file.\n If you have 3 seconds worth of video segments in each cameras HLS stream, this is the max you can set the poll time of the group to.\n + All cameras in a group should have the same HLS segment size setting, 1 and 2 second long segments have been tested to work.\n++ Mixing cameras with different aspect ratios may cause issues when cast.\n \n-This is still a very new feature and if you have any issues, please send some TRACE level log output of when the problem occurs.\n-\n-## Full Example\n-\n-Use the following examples to base your setup on to save some time if you wish to use textual config.\n-Textual config should only be used by advanced users as the [Discovery](#discovery) method should be preferred by new users.\n-\n-You can do a find and replace on the thing type from `dahua`, as all cameras use consistent naming of channels and configs so changing between them is easy.\n-\n-In the examples you will see the format is: `bindingID:thingType:UID` [param1=\"string\",param2=x,param3=x]\n-\n-bindingID: is always ipcamera.\n-thingType: is found listed above under [Supported Things](#supported-things).\n-UID: Can be made up but it must be UNIQUE, hence why it is called uniqueID. \n+## Sitemap Example\n \n-openHAB's discovery method will use the IP address with the dots removed as the UID.\n-By using textual config, you can name it something useful like \"DrivewayCamera\" if you wish, or stick with the same convention.\n-\n-*.things\n-\n-```java\n-\n-Thing ipcamera:group:OutsideCameras\n-[\n-    pollTime=2000,
