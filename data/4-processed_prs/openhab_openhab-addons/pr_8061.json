But my thinking was as follows..\nThe binding polls the hub at 60 seconds interval, so one approach would be to do such a \"hard refresh\" on every poll. But my observations (with only three shades in my house) show that whereas a soft poll takes only milliseconds, by contrast a hard refresh takes several seconds. I am concerned that if there were 10..15 shades, then the hard refresh time would exceed the polling interval. Also a hard refresh will wake the shades out of sleep, and since many of Hunter Douglas shades are battery powered, it risks to seriously reduce battery lifetime.\nFor the above reasons it is clear that, if the binding were to do hard refreshes periodically, then the interval must be significantly longer than the soft polling interval. My choice therefore was to make the hard refresh interval = \"infinite\". i.e. to do it manually at the discretion of the user. (And the user could set up their own rule to do it periodically, if they want to).\nNote that hard refreshes are only needed in the case that the user uses a wireless remote (which talks to the shades without informing the hub). If the user would only being using OpenHAB to command the shades, then the hub is always \"in the loop\" so hard requests are not required.\nNotwithstanding the above, I am amenable to changing the approach and doing hard refreshes periodically. There would then be a Config Param for hard refresh interval, that could be set to 0 to disable it. => But before making such a change, I would appreciate having inputs for my \"testing team\" => @berland and @mstroeve => what are your thoughts?\n\nBeside the usability aspect, this seems more like a ThingAction rather a Channel.\n\nI don't agree. If the hard refresh is to be done manually then it needs a UI; so it is logical to have an item linked to a channel as below..\n\n\nAlternatively, the user could disable and re-enable the Thing, which would trigger a REFRESH command.\n\nAargh!! IMHO that would NOT be an elegant solution at all :(", "author": "andrewfg", "createdAt": "2020-07-27T18:22:41Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2MDU2NDY3MA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2MTExNjg4OA==", "url": "https://github.com/openhab/openhab-addons/pull/8061#discussion_r461116888", "bodyText": "What a shame.
