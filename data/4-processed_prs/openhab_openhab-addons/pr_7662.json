What would happen if PortListener starts getting call on its methods before you have finished loading devices? The instant you leak this in a constructor you put yourself at risk of bugs NPE bugs that would normally not be possible if an object was constructed completely before exposing it to other objects.\nIn this case it might not cause a problem since things shouldn't start calling PortListener until you call driver.start() but leaking the this reference is a general problem to be aware of.\nThat said leaking the this is often the most convenient way to code something so at the very least try to make sure you leak this at the very end of your constructor when you know all the other class fields have been initialized, thus this would be \"safe\" to call from outside classes.\nhttp://www.javapractices.com/topic/TopicAction.do?Id=252", "author": "cpmeister", "createdAt": "2020-05-18T03:57:21Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyNjMyMzc2Mg=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyNjM1ODc0Nw==", "url": "https://github.com/openhab/openhab-addons/pull/7662#discussion_r426358747", "bodyText": "You might notice from the link I posted that they suggest not leaking this at ALL.
