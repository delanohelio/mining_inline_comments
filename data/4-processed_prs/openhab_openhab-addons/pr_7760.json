I don't understand what you mean with your last concerns.\n\nIf the future times out, that means that no new messages have arrived in X seconds, so the run method is called.\nA new call to accept() just reschedules the future, resetting the process.\n\nTo make things more clear, the current DelayedBatchProccesing class behavior is:\n\nThe first time the accept() method is called, the future timer is set and new objects are collected when accept() is triggered. After the delay time has passed, the run method is called.\n\nWith the proposed changes, the new behavior will be:\n\nThe first time the accept() method is called, the future timer is set, but it is rescheduled when a new object is accepted. The run method will be called only after delay seconds have passed since the last message.\n\nThe new logic ensures that discovery processes that take longer than initially anticipated can be completed successfully, as it was suggested in #5963 (comment). Perhaps I'm explaining something that is obvious, but I just wanted to avoid any misunderstanding.\nAnyway, tomorrow I will update the PR with the changes proposed by @cpmeister.
