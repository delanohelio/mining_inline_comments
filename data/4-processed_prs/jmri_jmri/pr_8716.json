A naive approach would be to just always fire a PropertyChangeEvent with null property values whenever setting muted to false. A more sophisticated approach would involve retaining the old value and sending the current value for any property that is muted while it is muted, and then firing the event with the old value and the current value when unmuted a muted property.\n\n\nIs the behavior specified if setPropertyChangeMuted(.. , false) is called twice?\n\n\nI have not specified any behavior if setPropertyChangeMuted(..., false) is called twice.

There have been multiple cases where, faced with \"well, I updated stuff, but it's not updating on the screen\", instead of fixing the underlying problem the (new) programmer looks around for something that has the side-effect of firing semi-random events until the screen eventually does update.  (I just took a case of that out of LayoutEditor; it was a pain to fix right) So I prefer to keep event-firing things focused on just what they need to do.
