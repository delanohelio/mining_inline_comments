It's defined as a series of <dt>/<dt> \"terms\" and <dd></dd> \"definitions\".\nIts fine to have multiple definitions for a single term, but then they're considered 'alternative' definitions:  'multiple paragraphs forming part of the same value must all be given within the same dd element.'\nI agree that most browsers don't make any distinction between multiple paragraphs within a value and multiple values.  Safari (my default browser) makes a visual distinction when doing default formatting, but doesn't make one with JMRI's CSS. John Plocher (@plocher)might have set that up intentionally.\nThere are places where it matters, though. We've recently seen one surface: a blind new user has been trying to work with JMRI via a screen reader.  He's uncovered several things in the program itself, most of which are now fixed.  But he's also sensitized me a bit to how we use HTML.  The screen reader is really good at working with standard HTML, but it's also quite literal:  It represents the mark up aspect of HTML quite specifically.\nSo I agree that it's not a reason to hold this PR. I'll merge it momentarily.  But it might be good to add to your every-growing list of things that could be improved in the documentation.\nThanks for your patience with this.", "author": "bobjacobsen", "createdAt": "2020-08-09T17:01:03Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2NzMzMzUxNQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "c3a6a1978707d6765aa22a1a96dc26be9e786166", "url": "https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/commit/c3a6a1978707d6765aa22a1a96dc26be9e786166", "message": "Update Errors.shtml\n\nChange title", "committedDate": "2020-08-08T01:24:33Z", "type": "commit"}]}
