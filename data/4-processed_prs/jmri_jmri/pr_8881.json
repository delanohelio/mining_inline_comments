At least if the name changes, the directory will probably still be the same.  So at least I have an idea where to look.  I'm not too good at remembering where 1000's of things are.  I'm only a lowly programmer shmuck! :-) :-)\nNow that you understand why the comment is there (for my memory, nothing else), if you still think I should remove it, I will.  I tell you all this because maybe I don't understand your comment (because of my my lack of understanding JMRI in general).\nAnd I really want to hear your opinion as to whether that is a good place for the memory aid for me.  I tend to put those reminders right in the source.  Maybe I shouldn't?
