They just guessed. These are few examples that I've recently heard and seen:\n  - A user tried to handle `RequestTimeout` using `isTimedOut` and `onExit()`.\n    - I guided him to use `setRequestTimeoutHandler`\n  - A user puts a heavy initialization logic in `onEnter` and clearing logic in `onExit`\n    - He could itinitialze once and clear it using `RequestLogAvailability.COMPLET`\n  - A user tried to send an diffrent `HttpStatus` than `200` in the Thrift service.\n    - What????\n\nThese APIs can give another option to users when they want to do something with a `RequestContext`. But most of the time, it's just confusing and no obsolete.\nI think we can do what we want to do without `onEnter` and `onExit`. Therefore, I hope to get rid of `onEnter` and `onExit`.", "committedDate": "2020-01-09T10:31:52Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "edde229b70c17028232811f96aaefc226ebc3cb1", "url": "https://github.com/line/armeria/commit/edde229b70c17028232811f96aaefc226ebc3cb1", "message": "Upadate", "committedDate": "2020-01-10T07:56:27Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "edde229b70c17028232811f96aaefc226ebc3cb1", "url": "https://github.com/line/armeria/commit/edde229b70c17028232811f96aaefc226ebc3cb1", "message": "Upadate", "committedDate": "2020-01-10T07:56:27Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM2NTExMTI1OQ==", "url": "https://github.com/line/armeria/pull/2375#discussion_r365111259", "bodyText": "It's kinna difficult for me to show a proper example for this right now.
