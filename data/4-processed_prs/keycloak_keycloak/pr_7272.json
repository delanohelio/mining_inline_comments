I would agree that it would be better to give a more detailed feedback which session failed.\nThe problem is that this \"back-channel logout light\" (lets call it like that) is always used when an logout has been triggert.\nCurrently the protocol.backchannelLogout() gets triggert but no boolean or any response getting returned. To fulfil the openID back-channel logout specification, we would need to return an http status. Now with our change we saw in a test scenario that, when there is only one session (the OP itself) and the logout gets triggert through the @get public logout() this line of code also gets triggert and results in a false positive test with an incorrect return.\nBecause at the end the session gets removed by \"session.sessions().removeUserSession(realm, userSession);\" even if the back-channel logout failed. The return would be 5xx but the session had been successfully removed through the removeUserSession() method.\nMaybe the best way would be to find an attribute or something that indicates the session as a non back-channel logout session. Then it would be easy when the logout process loops over all client sessions to decide which sessions should also be logout with the back-channel process. You will find this loop in the method AuthenticationManager.backchannelLogoutAll() line 324.\nBut we wasn't able to find something like that. Maybe this is only an problem when the OP is an Keycloak.\nIf the OP is a Keycloak it always have an back-channel logout URL and supports the back-channel logout. So the OP would try to logout it self through a back-channel logout request. Which also results in a 5xx or 4xx error.\nIf it would help, we could for sure set up a call and discuss about that.", "author": "DaSmoo", "createdAt": "2020-07-27T16:29:31Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2MDEzMDMxOA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2MTA0OTczMQ==", "url": "https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/pull/7272#discussion_r461049731", "bodyText": "I think I get it, see if it makes sense:\n\n\nI guess you mean org.keycloak.protocol.oidc.OIDCLoginProtocol#backchannelLogout, which we could change to return some information that the logout endpoint could use to decide which status code to return.

OP sends backchannel logout requests to downstream clients, let's assume one returns 200 and one 501.

So one status code would not be enough. We could also add session id's and so on to the json to get rid of that problem.\nThe second problem is that \"someone\" who called the backchannel logout at the Keycloak OP does normally not know about client ids and session ids of the Keycloak OP.
