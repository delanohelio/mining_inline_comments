My vote is just include everything, which you added to the documentation to this tooltip. So something like this: Signature algorithm to create JWT assertion as client authentication. In the case of JWT signed with private key or Client secret as jwt, it is required. If no algorithm is specified, the following algorithm is adapted. RS256is adapted the in the case of JWT signed with private key. HS256 is adapted the in the case of Client secret as jwt.", "author": "mposolda", "createdAt": "2021-02-03T13:41:26Z", "path": "themes/src/main/resources/theme/base/admin/messages/admin-messages_en.properties", "diffHunk": "@@ -644,6 +644,8 @@ client-auth.client_secret_jwt=Client secret as jwt\n client-auth.private_key_jwt=JWT signed with private key\n identity-provider.client-id.tooltip=The client or client identifier registered within the identity provider.\n client-secret=Client Secret\n+client-assertion-signing-algorithm=Client Assertion Signature Algorithm\n+client-assertion-signing-algorithm.tooltip=JWA Algorithm used for client assertions.", "originalCommit": "a03afaade59679d45f10e36acea3cc46ea21dde2", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU4MTkyNzU1Ng==", "url": "https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/pull/7691#discussion_r581927556", "bodyText": "That's exactly what you say.\nI added the same content as the documentation to tooltip message.", "author": "i7a7467", "createdAt": "2021-02-24T12:44:07Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU2OTQyMDc3Mw=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "fef97f13ff512731aa1b0389272f08cfc71b899b", "url": "https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/commit/fef97f13ff512731aa1b0389272f08cfc71b899b", "message": "KEYCLOAK-16679 Add algorithm settings for client assertion signature in OIDC identity broker", "committedDate": "2021-02-24T11:48:27Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "fef97f13ff512731aa1b0389272f08cfc71b899b", "url": "https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/commit/fef97f13ff512731aa1b0389272f08cfc71b899b", "message": "KEYCLOAK-16679 Add algorithm settings for client assertion signature in OIDC identity broker", "committedDate": "2021-02-24T11:48:27Z", "type": "forcePushed"}]}
