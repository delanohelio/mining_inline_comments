This is testsuite-only authenticator, which is not intended to be ever used in production. I've used authenticator just to be able to test this for the OAuth2 DirectGrant, as the Docker protocol automated tests don't work.\nAs you pointed, in case of the docker protocol, it is currently hardcoded - the note is set in the DockerEndpoint class. Other protocols (OIDC, SAML) currently don't have support for transient session in this PR - with the only exception of the testsuite, which have this SetClientNoteAuthenticator .\nDo you think that we need authenticator to be added to the main codebase to be able to have transient sessions per flow? I can think that OAuth2 Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant (Direct Grant) in some cases doesn't need user session at all. AFAIK Sometimes people use DirectGrant just for the single authentication to some CLI app and never need to refresh or introspect tokens etc. Not sure if this is useful also for some other protocols - like for example SAML ECP?

At the same time, I'm not sure if adding a config option to authentication flows is something we want to do.\nSAML ECP is a good example, yeah.\nBtw, transient sessions should not work if later you try to introspect the token using the token introspection endpoint, right? I mean, people should be aware that the lifetime of tokens issued using a transient session is bound to their time-related claims and can/should only be validated locally by the resource server.

My proposal would be to merge this PR as is once the docs are ready, and include no authenticator or other means to set the client note in the main code base now. It is straightforward to mark the session to be transient, and the best means to do so may depend on the particular use case. @pedroigor WDYT?", "author": "hmlnarik", "createdAt": "2020-10-08T09:04:10Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwMTEyMjIxOQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwMTU3Mzk1Nw==", "url": "https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/pull/7455#discussion_r501573957", "bodyText": "@hmlnarik @pedroigor Well, I am starting to think that Authenticator approach may be nice and will have some advantages :) Administrator can decide if he wants to create transient session by simply adding the authenticator to the authentication flow. May be useful for DirectGrant or SAML ECP. For Docker protocol, we can have this authenticator in the flow by default, but admin will have a chance to remove it if he wants and have sessions persistent for docker as well for some reason.\nAuthenticatior will have some additional flexibility that administrator may want to persist sessions just under specified condition (hence the authenticator can be added to some conditional subflow and be triggered just in case of the condition passed)... This is something, which won't be easily available if we have this as hardcoded option of the authentication flow.\nOn the other hand, this won't be classic \"Authenticator\", but rather some kind of interceptor in the authentication flow. But our Authentication SPI don't have this concept, so just use it as implementation of \"Authenticator\" interface can be possible.\nSo my ideal way would be to change this PR to have the Authenticator approach, but if you prefer, I can keep it as is and just update the documentation. WDYT?\nI agree that docs will need to be updated. As pointed, transient session would mean that introspection, \"refresh token\" or \"Revoke session\" won't be possible. I will update the docs once we refine whether to go with authenticator approach or keep the PR as is.", "author": "mposolda", "createdAt": "2020-10-08T09:23:40Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwMTEyMjIxOQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwMTY0MjA1MQ==", "url": "https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/pull/7455#discussion_r501642051", "bodyText": "The authenticator approach it is certainly interesting and possible way to deal with it, yet I am not convinced yet it's the right way.
