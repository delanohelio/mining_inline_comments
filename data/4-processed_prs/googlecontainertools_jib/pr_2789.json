However, we were taking a different flow for base image registries (as can be seen in the PR), and what is one of the reasons we don't have doRightAuth().\nGiven this and that RegistryClient is a low-level API, it also seemed reasonable to have separate nobs for configuring basic auth and completing bearer auth. Another factor to this is the difference between configuring basic auth and completing the whole bearer auth leg: configuring basic auth means that you'll just send the credentials going forward no matter what, while completing bearer auth means interacting with a registry server and an auth server with two round-trips to get another form of credentials to send going forward.", "author": "chanseokoh", "createdAt": "2020-09-29T16:36:32Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5NjM0NTY2MA=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5NjM0OTk3NA==", "url": "https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/2789#discussion_r496349974", "bodyText": "I find this flow a little confusing.
