Others involve\na new target exception type, with one strange serialization case.\n\nSigned-off-by: Danno Ferrin <danno.ferrin@gmail.com>", "committedDate": "2020-10-08T05:40:48Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwMTQ2NzY5MQ==", "url": "https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/1428#discussion_r501467691", "bodyText": "/s/a many/many/", "author": "macfarla", "createdAt": "2020-10-08T06:04:36Z", "path": "CHANGELOG.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -10,7 +10,7 @@ Prior versions of Besu would set the HTTP Status 400 Bad Request for JSON-RPC re\n \n In Besu version 20.10, properly formatted requests that have valid parameters (count and content) will return a HTTP Status 200 OK, with an error field if an error occurred. For example, requesting an account that does not exist in the chain, or a block by hash that Besu does not have, will now return HTTP 200 OK responses.
