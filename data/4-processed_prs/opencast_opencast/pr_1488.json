So I couldn't test that yet.\nTechnically the new profile uses a crop and a scale filter, not two scale filters. I compared execution times with vs without the crop on a video with even width/height. Videos with odd widht or height can't be encoded without the the original profile, so I had nothing to compare it against.\nWithout crop:\nreal    2m3.469s\nuser    3m38.199s\nsys     0m1.443s\n\nWith crop:\nreal    1m56.107s\nuser    3m34.956s\nsys     0m1.481s\n\nSo the crop operation doesn't seem to make a difference performance-wise.
