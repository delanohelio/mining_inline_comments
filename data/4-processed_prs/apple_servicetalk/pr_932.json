This logic does not preserve the execution\nstrategy that was used to register the original route and it\nuses the default strategy for a route.\n\nModifications:\n\n- Save the route execution strategy if it was configured for the\noriginal route;\n- Use saved execution strategy when we re-register filtered routes;\n- Add tests to verify the execution strategy configuration when\nusers apply a filter;\n- Close `GrpcPayloadWriter` in the conversion layer from\n`BlockingStreamingRoute` to `StreamingRoute`, because users of\n`BlockingRequestStreamingRoute` does not have access to it;\n\nResult:\n\ngRPC filters does not override configured execution strategy for\nthe route.", "committedDate": "2020-02-04T02:36:34Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "429aebc7d787241a20b08683ba29e7fab2578fcd", "url": "https://github.com/apple/servicetalk/commit/429aebc7d787241a20b08683ba29e7fab2578fcd", "message": "Verify `RouteExecutionStrategy` annotation is ignored on the service filter", "committedDate": "2020-02-04T02:36:40Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3NDk1Nzc0NA==", "url": "https://github.com/apple/servicetalk/pull/932#discussion_r374957744", "bodyText": "@NiteshKant should we account for users that may try-catch routes registration?

An additional check will be useless.\nIn my first impl I stored execution strategy before I verified routes duplication. That's why in the example above users will be in the state when they have serviceImpl with anotherStrategy.\nNow I moved executionStrategies.put(...) after we verify routes duplication. So, nothing will corrupt the internal state.\n\nAFAIR, this is required only for disallowing filters to specify the strategy annotation, rite? I have not thought of that case as to whether it is good or bad.\n\nRight. As we discussed before, ST policy is that if you configure an execution strategy for the route, ST will use it regardless of filters/influencers/etc.\nThe case here is that grpc filter implements the same service interface. Therefore, users can accidentally add @RouteExecutionStrategy annotation on the filter. I think we should ignore it.\n\nso if we need special code to disallow it, lets refrain from doing that for now and have \"behavior when strategy annotation is defined on filters is undefined\" as our answer.\n\nThe code to disallow annotation inspection for filters is trivial. It's just getOrDefault vs get on the map to distinguish key-null entry vs entry for this key does not exist.\nDefined behavior is always better than undefined.
