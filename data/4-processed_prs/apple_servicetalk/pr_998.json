It is nowhere we check that the payload of the response returned by the client can not be null unless we actually use it, eg: while deserializing. Deserializer here also is provided by the user. So really a user can pass null from everywhere and get back a null response and we really do not care.\nSo the point here isn't whether it is fair to make that assumption, it is really about whether there is any positive of making that assumption. Same argument as passing null through async sources, we do not care about it being null unless we use it.", "author": "NiteshKant", "createdAt": "2020-04-03T05:08:12Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwMjY3NTc1Ng=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwMjY3NjAzMg==", "url": "https://github.com/apple/servicetalk/pull/998#discussion_r402676032", "bodyText": "Same here, we should pass through null values.", "author": "NiteshKant", "createdAt": "2020-04-03T00:46:26Z", "path": "servicetalk-grpc-api/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/grpc/api/GrpcRouter.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -593,11 +593,10 @@ public void handle(final GrpcServiceContext ctx, final BlockingIterable<Req> req\n                                            final GrpcPayloadWriter<Resp> responseWriter) throws Exception {\n                             final Req firstItem;\n                             try (BlockingIterator<Req> requestIterator = request.iterator()) {\n-                                if (!requestIterator.hasNext()) {\n+                                if (!requestIterator.hasNext() || (firstItem = requestIterator.next()) == null) {", "originalCommit": "af98928a486c937250eb418ca26f5998cfeb9ab0", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "625e5666a68456f4c88d30922d4f24c64dacaf2e", "url": "https://github.com/apple/servicetalk/commit/625e5666a68456f4c88d30922d4f24c64dacaf2e", "message": "use assert instead of runtime check per review", "committedDate": "2020-04-03T18:55:55Z", "type": "commit"}]}
