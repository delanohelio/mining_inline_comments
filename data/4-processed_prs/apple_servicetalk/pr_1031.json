Any\n+additions to the repository are weighted on a spectrum of applicability and maintenance overhead. If a feature lies on\n+the limited applicability and high maintenance end of the spectrum the maintainers tend to decide against expanding\n+scope of the repository. In the future the Maintainers may create a separate organization to facilitate discovery and\n+collaboration for community projects. Until this time contributions can be maintained outside the ServiceTalk\n+project, demonstrate maturity/adoption, and then be considered for contribution back to the ServiceTalk organization.\n+\n+=== Become a Maintainer\n+Making contributions does not require becoming a maintainer, or obtaining commit access to the ServiceTalk\n+organization. However if you are interested in taking a more formal role with decision-making power you should\n+consider becoming a Maintainer. Some characteristics of a Maintainer are as follows:\n+\n+* Be involved in contributing code, pull request review, triage of issues and addressing user questions in one or more\n+forums such as GitHub, Stackoverflow, etc.\n+* Maintain sustained contribution to the ServiceTalk project and spend a reasonable amount of time on it.\n+* Show deep understanding of the areas contributed to, and good consideration of various reliability, usability,\n+backward compatibility, and performance requirements.\n+\n+If you believe you satisfy these above criteria please open a\n+link:https://github.com/apple/servicetalk/compare[GitHub pull request] modifying the\n+xref:MAINTAINERS.adoc[Maintainers doc] describing at least 5 non-trivial pull requests that have\n+been accepted without major modifications.
