Whenever I do a ReadMe update which contains new classes, I always do a quick \"Find...\" within the sample just to sanity check if we use the class from the generic sample description or not: samples can vary slightly between SDKs and also in name, so it's a good habit to get into!\nWhat is the purpose of the addition of this additional information here: is it intended that this sample use the HorizontalVerticalTransformation? Does the code require updating? If not then we can just reword to avoid specifically saying that our samples uses the GeographicTransformation: but you should probably double check the wording with the author of the common sample readme to be sure this still delivers the message intended.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n            This sample uses a `GeographicTransformation`, which extends the `DatumTransformation` class.
