The density of vertices along the ship's route is appropriate to represent the path of the ship at the sample map view's initial scale. However, that level of detail may be too great if you wanted to show a polyline of the ship's movement down the whole of the Willamette river. Then, you might consider generalizing the polyline to still faithfully represent the ship's passage on the river without having an overly complicated geometry.\n \n-Use the sliders to control the parameters of the densify and generalize methods.

The geodesic path between the two points will update.\n+Click anywhere on the map. A line graphic will display the geodesic line between the two points.

Pass this polyline to: `GeometryEngine.densifyGeodetic(polyline, segmentLength, unitOfMeasurement, GeodeticCurveType.GEODESIC)`. This will create a new polyline with segments of length `segmentLength` and `LinearUnit` set to `unitOfMeasurement`. The curve will be geodesic.\n-3.
