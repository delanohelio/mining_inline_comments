One might turn off the visibility of water main and pipe sublayers to make the valves easier to identify.\n+Annotation, which differs from labels by having a fixed place and size, is typically only relevant at particular scales. Annotation sublayers allow for finer control of annotation by allowing properties (like visibility in the map and legend) to be set and others to be read (like name) on subtypes of an annotation layer.\n+\n+An annotation dataset which marks valves as \"Opened\" or \"Closed\", might be set to display the \"Closed\" valves over a broader range of scales than the \"Opened\" valves, if the \"Closed\" data is considered more relevant by the map's author. Regardless, the user can be given a manual option to set visibility of annotation sublayers on and off, if required.\n \n ## How to use the sample\n \n-Zoom in to change the map's scale. The annotation sublayers were authored so that the \"Open\" sublayer will be visible for scales 1:500-1:2000 and the \"Closed\" sublayer is always visible. Use the checkboxes to toggle a sublayer's visibility.\n+Start the sample and take note of the visibility of the annotation. Zoom in and out to see the annotation turn on and off based on scale ranges set on the data.\n+\n+Use the checkboxes to manually set \"Open\" and \"Closed\" annotation sublayers visibility to on or off.\n \n ## How it works\n \n-1. Load a `MobileMapPackage` containing annotation layers.\n-2. Get the `AnnotationSublayer` from the `Annotation Layer` of the mobile map package.\n-3. Set the annotation sublayer's visibility as required.\n+1. Load the `MobileMapPackage`.\n+2. Populate checkbox text with the `AnnotationSublayer` names (including maximum and minimum scales, where relevant).", "originalCommit": "fe88a04fc8cbf8d8a54e5f4801c1266a29efd7f8", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5Nzc1MzAzNg==", "url": "https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-samples-java/pull/448#discussion_r397753036", "bodyText": "Totally agree @Rachael-E .
