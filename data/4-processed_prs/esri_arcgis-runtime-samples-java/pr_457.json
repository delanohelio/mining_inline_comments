Use `TransformationCatalog.getTransformationsBySuitability(inputSR, outputSR)` for transformations based on the map's spatial reference OR `TransformationCatalog.getTransformationsBySuitability(inputSR,outputSR, mapView.getCurrentVisibileArea().getExtent())` for transformations suitable to the current extent.\n-2. Pick one of the `DatumTransformation`s returned. Use `GeometryEngine.project(inputGeometry,outputSR, datumTransformation)` to get the transformed geometry.\n+1. Pass the input and output spatial references to `TransformationCatalog.getTransformationsBySuitability()` for transformations based on the map's spatial reference OR additionally provide an extent argument to only return transformations suitable to the extent. This returns a list of ranked transformations.\n+2. Use one of the `DatumTransformation` objects returned to project the input geometry to the output spatial reference.\n \n ## Relevant API\n \n-* ArcGISMap\n-* Basemap\n * DatumTransformation\n+* GeographicTransformation\n+* GeographicTransformationStep", "originalCommit": "57222e0f4622636b5d5570511ea739077838225d", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5ODQ3MzkxMw==", "url": "https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-samples-java/pull/457#discussion_r398473913", "bodyText": "Good catch, thanks!", "author": "JonLavi", "createdAt": "2020-03-26T10:42:57Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5NjM2NzY5OA=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5NjQxMzU4MQ==", "url": "https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-samples-java/pull/457#discussion_r396413581", "bodyText": "For the title, it should be sentence case", "author": "Rachael-E", "createdAt": "2020-03-23T12:28:00Z", "path": "geometry/spatial-operations/README.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -2,20 +2,20 @@\n ", "originalCommit": "57222e0f4622636b5d5570511ea739077838225d", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5ODQ3NDA0OQ==", "url": "https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-samples-java/pull/457#discussion_r398474049", "bodyText": "Thanks, updated to sentence case", "author": "JonLavi", "createdAt": "2020-03-26T10:43:12Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5NjQxMzU4MQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5NjQxMzg3NQ==", "url": "https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-samples-java/pull/457#discussion_r396413875", "bodyText": "looks like there's an unneeded space at the start of this sentence", "author": "Rachael-E", "createdAt": "2020-03-23T12:28:30Z", "path": "geometry/spatial-operations/README.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -2,20 +2,20 @@\n \n Find the union, difference, or intersection of two geometries.\n \n-![](SpatialOperations.png)\n+![Image of spatial operations](SpatialOperations.png)\n+\n+## Use case\n+\n+Determining the spatial relationships between points, lines or polygons is a fundamental concept in GIS.
