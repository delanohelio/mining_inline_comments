Each sample is an individual [Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html) project that can be run standalone. The Gradle buildscripts have tasks for running the application, building a jar, and distributing the app as a zip.\n \n Installing Gradle is not necessary since each sample includes the Gradle wrapper.\n \n+Accessing Esri location services, including basemaps, routing, and geocoding, requires authentication using either an ArcGIS identity or an API Key:\n+ 1. ArcGIS identity: An ArcGIS named user account that is a member of an organization in ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Enterprise.\n+ 2. API key: A permanent key that gives your application access to Esri location services. Visit your [ArcGIS Developers Dashboard](https://developers.arcgis.com/dashboard) to create a new API key or access an existing API key.\n+\n ## Instructions\n \n ### IntelliJ IDEA\n \n 1.
