Not all nodes can be zoomed to (e.g. screen overlays).\n \n ## How it works\n \n-To list the nodes in a KML file:\n-\n-1. Create a `KmlDataset` pointing to the KML file.\n-2. Start with a list of the rood nodes with `kmlDataset.getRootNodes()`.\n-3. For each node, check if it is a `KmlContainer` or `KmlNetworkLink`. These types can have child nodes. If it is one of these, cast to the appropriate type and call `getChildNodes()`.\n-4. Recursively search these child nodes for more nodes.\n+1. Add the KML file to the scene as a layer.\n+2. Explore the root nodes of the `KmlDataset` recursively explored to create a view model.\n+  * Each node is enabled for display at this step. KML files may include nodes that are turned off by default.\n+3. When a node is selected, use the node's `Extent` to determine a viewpoint and set the `SceneView` object's viewpoint do it.", "originalCommit": "16e1e9490135f2acb54b1933e392a52920c36113", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5NzIwNzU0NQ==", "url": "https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-samples-java/pull/460#discussion_r397207545", "bodyText": "we need to tweak this for our sample, though I've noticed a UI ?bug/behaviour difference.
