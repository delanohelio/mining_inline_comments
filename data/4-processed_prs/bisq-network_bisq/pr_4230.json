Therefore a more appropriate place for them is in the common stylesheet.\n\nThis move means that alternating row background colors are now available for all tables and lists, in all views, in both dark and light themes.", "committedDate": "2020-05-03T12:09:11Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "c7ccc434750fb1828f75eece6e8cf8d16b167063", "url": "https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/commit/c7ccc434750fb1828f75eece6e8cf8d16b167063", "message": "More readable tables and views: Highlight table and list row on hover\n\nThe same styling as for a selected row, is applied for a hovered row.\n\nThis makes the UI more intuitive, helping users better navigate through and focus on specific rows, especially in large tables.", "committedDate": "2020-05-03T12:15:14Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyMjYxNjk4MQ==", "url": "https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/4230#discussion_r422616981", "bodyText": "Maybe nitpicky, but there is whitespace inconsistency :)", "author": "ph-legacy", "createdAt": "2020-05-10T09:27:31Z", "path": "desktop/src/main/java/bisq/desktop/bisq.css", "diffHunk": "@@ -867,6 +891,32 @@ textfield */\n  * Table                                                                       *\n  *                                                                             *\n  ******************************************************************************/\n+.table-view .table-row-cell:even .table-cell {\n+    -fx-background-color: derive(-bs-background-color, 5%);\n+    -fx-border-color: derive(-bs-background-color,5%);", "originalCommit": "c7ccc434750fb1828f75eece6e8cf8d16b167063", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyNzM4MjU2Nw==", "url": "https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/4230#discussion_r427382567", "bodyText": "I agree, just run some auto formatter on the code to get spacing uniform.
