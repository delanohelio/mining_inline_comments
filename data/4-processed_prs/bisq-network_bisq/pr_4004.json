If you're not comfortable doing this, then please manage that @wiz does it in his role as ops team lead. The point is that changes like this are useless unless they're effectively communicated and followed up on. It doesn't mean you have to do the work yourself, but that you own that the work does get done. Updating a readme (or the wiki for that matter) on its own won't carry the day.
