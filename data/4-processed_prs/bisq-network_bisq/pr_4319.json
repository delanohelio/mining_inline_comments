After that, there's nothing left to\nread. Even if it were to try, it wouldn't get anything from the terminal\ninput, because it's not connected to it. The pipe has replaced standard\ninput for the shell process.\n\nInstead, create a pipe for bash to read the output of curl from and\nprovide it as the script file argument.
