I had three reasons for including it originally: 1.) we'll continue to run the test and ensure the functionality continues to work, 2.) we'll understand our feature coverage by language for all features, not just common ones, and 3.) we'll include that feature's example code in our JSON output, which helps people trying to understanding the functionality in, e.g. the cloud app editor.\nIf people are concerned about this feature in other languages we can point them at our shiny new list that doesn't include it in any support tiers :)\n\nI'm also not sure why we're keeping in regex_fieldname (which is currently only in js) as compared to something like metavar_typed_fieldaccess, which has tests in java and go\n\nHuh, TIL about metavar_typed_fieldaccess!
