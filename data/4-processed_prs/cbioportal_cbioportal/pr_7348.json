It looks like for OncoKB and CIVIC we have separate sections for those integrations. I think it would be good to make one for Genome Nexus as well. This PR just made me realize it seems there is none at the moment\nThe Genome Build section can then be a subheader of this new Genome Nexus Integration header smiilar to OncoKB: https://docs.cbioportal.org/2.3-customization/portal.properties-reference#oncokb-integration\nMaybe something like this:\n# Genome Nexus Integration\nGenome Nexus provides annotations of mutations in cBioPortal. The mutations tab relies heavily on the Genome Nexus API, therefore that tab won't work well without it. By default cBioPortal will use the public Genome Nexus API, such that no extra configuration is necessary.\n\n## Genome Build\nGenome Nexus supports both GRCh37 and GRCh38, but support for the latter is limited. Several annotation sources served by Genome Nexus might not have official GRCh38 support yet i.e. [OncoKB](https://www.oncokb.org/), [CIViC](https://civicdb.org/), [Cancer Hotspots](https://www.cancerhotspots.org/), [My Cancer Genome](https://www.mycancergenome.org/) and [3D structures](https://g2s.genomenexus.org/). Although most of the time the canonical transcript for a gene will be the same between GRCh37 and GRCh38 there might be some that cause issues. In addition the complete integration of cBioPortal with Genome Nexus' GRCh38 is not complete yet. That is cBioPortal currently only connects to one Genome Nexus API by default (the GRCh37 one), so it's not possible to have multiple genome builds in one instance of cBioPortal and get the correct annotations from Genome Nexus for both. Currently only the [mutation mapper tool page](https://www.cbioportal.org/mutation_mapper) is able to handle both.\n\n## Properties\nBy default the Genome Nexus API url is set to https://v1.genomenexus.org/, which uses GRCh37.
