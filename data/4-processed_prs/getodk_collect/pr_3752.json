The test that is introduced should fail or crash at this point and this one passes. I don't understand \"shown\" in its name. This issue is only about the underlying value, not about what is displayed, right? If you were going to test what is displayed, innerText on getChildAt(0) wouldn't make sense because that gives you the linear layout that contains the audio-video-image-text-label view.\nI think you probably want to do something like select the first choice and verify that its value is blank.
