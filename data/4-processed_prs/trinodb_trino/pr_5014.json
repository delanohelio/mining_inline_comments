No precision is specified for the column (example: ``NUMBER`` or\n+   ``NUMBER(*)``), unless ``oracle.number.default-scale`` is set. \n+ - Scale (``s`` ) is greater than precision. \n+ - Precision (``p`` ) is greater than 38. \n+ - Scale is negative and the difference between ``p`` and ``s`` is greater than\n+   38, unless ``oracle.number.rounding-mode`` is set to a different value than\n+   ``UNNECESSARY``. \n+\n+If a column meets any of these conditions, it shows an error:\n+\n+ - An ``unsupported-type.handling-strategy`` equals ``FAIL``\n+   (default configuration) any queries on the table fail.\n+ - An ``unsupported-type.handling-strategy`` equals ``IGNORE``\n+   (default configuration), Presto no longer accesses the column.\n+ - An ``unsupported-type.handling-strategy`` equals ``CONVERT_TO_VARCHAR``\n+   (default configuration), a column value converts to an unbounded ``VARCHAR``.\n+\n+If ``s`` is negative, ``NUMBER(p, s)`` maps to ``DECIMAL(p + s, 0)``.\n+\n+For Oracle ``NUMBER`` (without precision and scale), you can change\n+``oracle.number.default-scale=s`` and map the column to ``DECIMAL(38, s)``.\n+\n+.. _datetime mapping:\n+\n+Mapping datetime types\n+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n+\n+Selecting a timestamp with fractional second precision (``p``) greater than 3\n+truncates the fractional seconds to three digits instead of rounding it.\n+\n+Oracle ``DATE`` values may store hours, minutes, and seconds, mapped\n+to Presto ``TIMESTAMP``.\n+\n+.. warning::\n+\n+  Due to date and time differences in the libraries used by Presto and the\n+  Oracle JDBC driver, attempting to insert or select a datetime value earlier\n+  than ``1582-10-15`` results in an incorrect date inserted.\n+\n+.. _character mapping:\n+\n+Mapping character types\n+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n+\n+Presto's ``VARCHAR(n)`` maps to ``VARCHAR2(n CHAR)`` if ``n`` is no greater than\n+4000. A larger or unbounded ``VARCHAR`` maps to ``NCLOB``.\n+\n+Presto's ``CHAR(n)`` maps to ``CHAR(n CHAR)`` if ``n`` is no greater than 2000.\n+A larger ``CHAR`` maps to ``NCLOB``.\n+\n+Using ``CREATE TABLE AS`` to create an ``NCLOB`` column from a ``CHAR`` value\n+removes the trailing spaces from the initial values for the column. Inserting\n+``CHAR`` values into existing ``NCLOB`` columns keeps the trailing spaces. For\n+example::\n+\n+    presto> CREATE TABLE vals AS SELECT CAST('A' as CHAR(2001)) col;\n+    presto> INSERT INTO vals (col) VALUES (CAST('BB' as CHAR(2001)));\n+    presto> SELECT LENGTH(col) FROM vals;\n+    2001\n+    1\n+\n+Attempting to write a ``CHAR`` that doesn't fit in the column's actual size\n+fails.

A larger or unbounded ``VARCHAR`` maps to ``NCLOB``.\n+\n+Presto's ``CHAR(n)`` maps to ``CHAR(n CHAR)`` if ``n`` is no greater than 2000.\n+A larger ``CHAR`` maps to ``NCLOB``.\n+\n+Using ``CREATE TABLE AS`` to create an ``NCLOB`` column from a ``CHAR`` value\n+removes the trailing spaces from the initial values for the column. Inserting\n+``CHAR`` values into existing ``NCLOB`` columns keeps the trailing spaces.

When data is inserted into existing\n+   tables ``Oracle to Presto`` type mapping is used.\n+\n+.. list-table:: Presto to Oracle Type Mapping\n+  :widths: 20, 20, 60\n+  :header-rows: 1\n+\n+  * - Presto type\n+    - Oracle database type\n+    - Notes\n+  * - ``TINYINT``\n+    - ``NUMBER(3)``\n+    -\n+  * - ``SMALLINT``\n+    - ``NUMBER(5)``\n+    -\n+  * - ``INTEGER``\n+    - ``NUMBER(10)``\n+    -\n+  * - ``BIGINT``\n+    - ``NUMBER(19)``\n+    -\n+  * - ``DECIMAL(p, s)``\n+    - ``NUMBER(p, s)``\n+    -\n+  * - ``REAL``\n+    - ``BINARY_FLOAT``\n+    -\n+  * - ``DOUBLE``\n+    - ``BINARY_DOUBLE``\n+    -\n+  * - ``VARCHAR``\n+    - ``NCLOB``\n+    -\n+  * - ``VARCHAR(n)``\n+    - ``VARCHAR2(n CHAR)`` or ``NCLOB``\n+    - See :ref:`character mapping`\n+  * - ``CHAR(n)``\n+    - ``CHAR(n CHAR)`` or ``NCLOB``\n+    - See :ref:`character mapping`\n+  * - ``VARBINARY``\n+    - ``BLOB``\n+    -\n+  * - ``DATE``\n+    - ``DATE``\n+    - See :ref:`datetime mapping`\n+  * - ``TIMESTAMP``\n+    - ``TIMESTAMP(3)``\n+    - See :ref:`datetime mapping`\n+  * - ``TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE``\n+    - ``TIMESTAMP(3) WITH TIME ZONE``\n+    - See :ref:`datetime mapping`\n+\n+.. _number mapping:\n+\n+Mapping numeric types\n+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n+\n+An Oracle ``NUMBER(p, s)`` maps to Presto's ``DECIMAL(p, s)`` except in these\n+conditions:\n+\n+- No precision is specified for the column (example: ``NUMBER`` or\n+  ``NUMBER(*)``), unless ``oracle.number.default-scale`` is set. \n+- Scale (``s`` ) is greater than precision. \n+- Precision (``p`` ) is greater than 38. \n+- Scale is negative and the difference between ``p`` and ``s`` is greater than\n+  38, unless ``oracle.number.rounding-mode`` is set to a different value than\n+  ``UNNECESSARY``. \n+   \n+If ``s`` is negative, ``NUMBER(p, s)`` maps to ``DECIMAL(p + s, 0)``.\n+\n+For Oracle ``NUMBER`` (without precision and scale), you can change\n+``oracle.number.default-scale=s`` and map the column to ``DECIMAL(38, s)``.\n+\n+.. _datetime mapping:\n+\n+Mapping datetime types\n+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n+\n+Selecting a timestamp with fractional second precision (``p``) greater than 3\n+truncates the fractional seconds to three digits instead of rounding it.\n+\n+Oracle ``DATE`` type may store hours, minutes, and seconds, so it is mapped\n+to Presto ``TIMESTAMP``.\n+\n+.. warning::\n+\n+  Due to date and time differences in the libraries used by Presto and the\n+  Oracle JDBC driver, attempting to insert or select a datetime value earlier\n+  than ``1582-10-15`` results in an incorrect date inserted.\n+\n+.. _character mapping:\n+\n+Mapping character types\n+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n+\n+Presto's ``VARCHAR(n)`` maps to ``VARCHAR2(n CHAR)`` if ``n`` is no greater than\n+4000. A larger or unbounded ``VARCHAR`` maps to ``NCLOB``.\n+\n+Presto's ``CHAR(n)`` maps to ``CHAR(n CHAR)`` if ``n`` is no greater than 2000.\n+A larger ``CHAR`` maps to ``NCLOB``.\n+\n+Using ``CREATE TABLE AS`` to create an ``NCLOB`` column from a ``CHAR`` value\n+removes the trailing spaces from the initial values for the column. Inserting\n+``CHAR`` values into existing ``NCLOB`` columns keeps the trailing spaces. For\n+example::\n+\n+    presto> CREATE TABLE vals AS SELECT CAST('A' as CHAR(2001)) col;\n+    presto> INSERT INTO vals (col) VALUES (CAST('BB' as CHAR(2001)));\n+    presto> SELECT LENGTH(col) FROM vals;\n+    2001\n+    1\n+\n+Attempting to write a ``CHAR`` that doesn't fit in the column's actual size\n+fails. This is also true for the equivalent ``VARCHAR`` types.\n+\n+Type mapping configuration properties\n+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n+\n+.. list-table:: Type Mapping Properties\n+  :widths: 20, 20, 50, 10\n+  :header-rows: 1\n+\n+  * - Configuration property name\n+    - Session property name\n+    - Description\n+    - Default\n+  * - ``unsupported-type.handling-strategy``\n+    - ``unsupported_type_handling_strategy``\n+    - Configures how unsupported column data types are handled:\n+\n+      - ``IGNORE`` - column is not accessible.\n+      - ``CONVERT_TO_VARCHAR`` - column is converted to unbounded ``VARCHAR``.\n+\n+    - ``IGNORE``\n+  * - ``oracle.number.default-scale``\n+    - ``number_default_scale``               \n+    - Default Presto ``DECIMAL`` scale for Oracle ``NUMBER`` (without precision \n+      and scale) date type.

This is useful when \n+      Oracle ``NUMBER`` data type specifies higher scale than is supported in \n+      Presto. Possible values are:\n+\n+      - ``UNNECESSARY`` - Rounding mode to assert that the \n+        requested operation has an exact result, \n+        hence no rounding is necessary.\n+      - ``CEILING`` - Rounding mode to round towards\n+        positive infinity.\n+      - ``FLOOR`` - Rounding mode to round towards negative\n+        infinity.\n+      - ``HALF_DOWN`` - Rounding mode to round towards\n+        ``nearest neighbor`` unless both neighbors are\n+        equidistant, in which case rounding down is used.\n+      - ``HALF_EVEN`` - Rounding mode to round towards the\n+        ``nearest neighbor`` unless both neighbors are equidistant,\n+        in which case rounding towards the even neighbor is\n+        performed.\n+      - ``HALF_UP`` - Rounding mode to round towards\n+        ``nearest neighbor`` unless both neighbors are\n+        equidistant, in which case rounding up is used\n+      - ``UP`` - Rounding mode to round towards zero.\n+      - ``DOWN`` - Rounding mode to round towards zero.\n+\n+    - ``UNNECESSARY``\n+\n+Synonyms\n+--------\n+\n+Based on performance reasons, Presto disables support for Oracle ``SYNONYM``. To\n+include ``SYNONYM``, add the following configuration property: \n+\n+.. code-block:: none\n+\n+    oracle.synonyms.enabled=true\n+\n+Pushdown\n+--------\n+\n+The connector supports :doc:`pushdown </optimizer/pushdown>` for optimized query processing.\n \n Limitations\n -----------\n \n-The following SQL statements are not yet supported:\n+The following SQL statements are not supported:\n \n * :doc:`/sql/delete`\n+* :doc:`/sql/alter-table`\n+* :doc:`/sql/create-table` (:doc:`/sql/create-table-as` is supported)", "originalCommit": "991288cc1bc3d91b3913d0b39459ab6419edeea2", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5ODkyNjg3Nw==", "url": "https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/5014#discussion_r498926877", "bodyText": "Just checked.
