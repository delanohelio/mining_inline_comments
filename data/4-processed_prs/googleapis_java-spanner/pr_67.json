It seems that sessions acquired by the user will get closed and sessions acquired by the client library gets released.\n\nThat is correct(ish), but the naming of the Session.close() method is a little bit confusing in this case. This is roughly what is going on in the session pool regarding checking out, closing, releasing etc.:\n\nUser code will never see a session. Instead, user code sees different types of transactions (read/write, read-only, single use) and ResultSets. A session is automatically checked out from the session pool by the client library when one is needed for a transaction requested by user code. Checking out a session is always one of the methods getReadSession or getReadWriteSession. A session leak can be caused by user code if it fails to end a transaction or to close a ResultSet.\nThe getReadSession and getReadWriteSession methods return a PooledSession instance. The close method of this class will check whether the session is still considered valid, and if so, release it into the pool (releaseSession()) or delete it (invalidateSession()).\nSo technically, only the client library checks sessions out and releases them back into the session pool. User code never does (directly).\nIn addition to the above, there is also the PoolMaintainer: The PoolMaintainer never really checks a session out from the pool, although the keepAlive method does do something that comes very close: It manually removes a session from the inventory of the pool, executes a ping request and then calls releaseSession() to add it back to the inventory. This is not tracked by the session pool as a session that is checked out and back in again, and should also be treated separately from all the other measurements for session leaks.\n\nRegarding the current test results with NUM_RELEASED_SESSIONS == 5 and NUM_ACQUIRED_SESSIONS == 0. This is because the NUM_ACQUIRED_SESSIONS is only increased if a session could be acquired without causing a wait, and the 2 sessions that are being checked out, are being checked out directly after the session pool has been created. The pool therefore has not had the time to create any sessions yet, which will place both requests in a (very short) wait before they can be served.\nNUM_RELEASED_SESSIONS is 5 because it is counting all calls to releaseSession. That method is also called when a session is created and released into the pool. You should only count the number of calls to PooledSession#close() (see also my comment above).", "author": "olavloite", "createdAt": "2020-02-20T15:22:23Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4MTAxNTE5OQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4MjI5MzMwOQ==", "url": "https://github.com/googleapis/java-spanner/pull/67#discussion_r382293309", "bodyText": "@olavloite would like to get your eyes on this.", "author": "mayurkale22", "createdAt": "2020-02-20T22:26:51Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4MTAxNTE5OQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "ed6e1304b31bc1370a4515c60004274c7cf27e66", "url": "https://github.com/googleapis/java-spanner/commit/ed6e1304b31bc1370a4515c60004274c7cf27e66", "message": "Apply skuruppu@'s recommendations", "committedDate": "2020-02-20T05:23:47Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"oid": "d6c99a323be58b12a161ebcaa47c5b27be8441d3", "url": "https://github.com/googleapis/java-spanner/commit/d6c99a323be58b12a161ebcaa47c5b27be8441d3", "message": "Apply skuruppu@'s recommendations", "committedDate": "2020-02-21T22:04:50Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"oid": "a268a3b91371d35c6cdae5c84b0d0f00468222e6", "url": "https://github.com/googleapis/java-spanner/commit/a268a3b91371d35c6cdae5c84b0d0f00468222e6", "message": "Apply skuruppu@'s recommendations", "committedDate": "2020-02-25T18:38:01Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"oid": "b33434351e05bfb40a39894c1c0f9c8b1ed88388", "url": "https://github.com/googleapis/java-spanner/commit/b33434351e05bfb40a39894c1c0f9c8b1ed88388", "message": "add acquired and released sessions data", "committedDate": "2020-02-27T16:48:48Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "e59b250691249e320e2764066def2665210bcf8b", "url": "https://github.com/googleapis/java-spanner/commit/e59b250691249e320e2764066def2665210bcf8b", "message": "update the description", "committedDate": "2020-02-27T16:48:48Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "8fd83ba9b2c342b80729e7c2076c9729fbb18028", "url": "https://github.com/googleapis/java-spanner/commit/8fd83ba9b2c342b80729e7c2076c9729fbb18028", "message": "update the description", "committedDate": "2020-02-27T16:48:49Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "4b6462075b459f8102a37260327b34dd82ac3f85", "url": "https://github.com/googleapis/java-spanner/commit/4b6462075b459f8102a37260327b34dd82ac3f85", "message": "Apply skuruppu@'s recommendations", "committedDate": "2020-02-27T16:48:49Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "89cb12a5e4793d992418bf58e3f85f4d1df99113", "url": "https://github.com/googleapis/java-spanner/commit/89cb12a5e4793d992418bf58e3f85f4d1df99113", "message": "apply olavloite@'s recommendations", "committedDate": "2020-02-27T16:48:49Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "ab228d1f3939cc9c0a8004ec3f49edc0748fd118", "url": "https://github.com/googleapis/java-spanner/commit/ab228d1f3939cc9c0a8004ec3f49edc0748fd118", "message": "minor fix", "committedDate": "2020-02-27T16:48:49Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "ab228d1f3939cc9c0a8004ec3f49edc0748fd118", "url": "https://github.com/googleapis/java-spanner/commit/ab228d1f3939cc9c0a8004ec3f49edc0748fd118", "message": "minor fix", "committedDate": "2020-02-27T16:48:49Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"oid": "e39dbb624f77b6fdc464f978566d6a813e0d2e43", "url": "https://github.com/googleapis/java-spanner/commit/e39dbb624f77b6fdc464f978566d6a813e0d2e43", "message": "attempt to fix build", "committedDate": "2020-02-27T17:06:54Z", "type": "commit"}]}
