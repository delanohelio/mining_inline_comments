That is as well the only change in logic that is possible. Currently, all received variables are sent along with the complete job command and merged into (i.e. overwritten) in the workflow instance. So nothing really happens, because they are overwritten with the same value. We consider this bad practice because it can easily lead to race conditions when you parallelise part of the workflow.\nCompleting the job with no variables, just means that no variables will be merged into the workflow instance", "author": "korthout", "createdAt": "2020-08-11T12:05:49Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2Nzc2MzAwNQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2ODUzOTc4OA==", "url": "https://github.com/camunda-cloud/zeebe/pull/5131#discussion_r468539788", "bodyText": "Please lets discuss via zoom", "author": "Zelldon", "createdAt": "2020-08-11T12:24:47Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2Nzc2MzAwNQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "d3e10c6eafa07656c50273a5184982fdb1bb3be8", "url": "https://github.com/camunda-cloud/zeebe/commit/d3e10c6eafa07656c50273a5184982fdb1bb3be8", "message": "chore(worker): read payload from file", "committedDate": "2020-08-11T13:07:33Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "480d78953d3cbe8ad3d6caf9557a73dde56b6141", "url": "https://github.com/camunda-cloud/zeebe/commit/480d78953d3cbe8ad3d6caf9557a73dde56b6141", "message": "chore(benchmark): support file location for payload", "committedDate": "2020-08-18T09:21:40Z", "type": "commit"}]}
