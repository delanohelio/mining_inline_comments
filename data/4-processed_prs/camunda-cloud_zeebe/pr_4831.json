On bumping the log4j version, then the Elasticsearch version had a dependency version conflict, so I bumped it, too.\nI agree with your sentiment that changing versions during backport is not trivial.

In this case I would open another issue to bump the log4j version.\nPlease advise.", "author": "pihme", "createdAt": "2020-06-29T07:43:30Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0Njc5NDQ1NQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}]}
