I don't think this will affect compilation\ntime, including incremental compilation, significantly.", "committedDate": "2020-12-10T08:50:50Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0MDM4MDA2Mw==", "url": "https://github.com/vmware/differential-datalog/pull/852#discussion_r540380063", "bodyText": "no library function doing this?\nanyway, it's small.", "author": "mbudiu-vmw", "createdAt": "2020-12-10T17:57:53Z", "path": "src/Language/DifferentialDatalog/Util.hs", "diffHunk": "@@ -181,6 +181,34 @@ updateFile path content = do\n                 renameFile tmppath path\n        else writeFile path content\n \n+-- | Update an entire directory tree, updating files whose contents has changed,\n+-- creating new files and deleting files not in `files` list, but keeping\n+-- files that haven't changed unmodified.\n+updateDirectory :: FilePath -> M.Map FilePath String -> IO ()\n+updateDirectory dir files = do\n+    -- Prepend directory path to all file names.\n+    let files' = M.mapKeys (dir </>) files\n+    -- Current directory contents.\n+    existing_files <- traverseDir dir\n+    -- Files not in the tree.\n+    let to_delete = filter (\\f -> M.notMember f files') existing_files\n+    mapM_ removeFile to_delete\n+    -- Update or create files in the tree.\n+    mapM_ (\\(mpath, mtext) -> updateFile mpath mtext)\n+          $ M.toList files'\n+\n+-- | Traverse directory tree, returning the list of files in it.\n+traverseDir :: FilePath -> IO [FilePath]", "originalCommit": "9793081c133e6f9d3681dc82671f6fc6efafc9b9", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "bde47cea6c837638046c330eae34508bb981d20a", "url": "https://github.com/vmware/differential-datalog/commit/bde47cea6c837638046c330eae34508bb981d20a", "message": "Remove old files from `types/`.\n\nWhen creating the Rust project, the compiler only overwrites files that\nhave changed, leaving other files unmodified.
