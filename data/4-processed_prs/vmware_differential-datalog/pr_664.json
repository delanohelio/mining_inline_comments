The compiler has\nsome amount of builtin support for both of them.  This patch generalizes\nthis support by abstracting away both types as shared references.  It\nalso enables additional user-defined share reference types to be added\nin the future.  As a result, `&` pattern matching syntax now works for\nboth `Ref` and `Intern`, which enables wider use of the latter.\n\nDetails\n-------\n\n`Ref` and `Intern` are both motivated by the fact that DDlog records are\nimmutable, and therefore can be copied around by reference, which saves\na lot of memory for large records.\n\nCompared to `Ref`, `Intern` enables faster comparison and hashing\noperations at the cost of slower creation plus some locking overhead.\n\nThe compiler has some builtin support for both types, but support for\n`Ref` is more extensive; most importantly, the `&` syntax allows pattern\nmatching values inside `Ref`, which is essential in order to store\nstructured data by reference.\n\nInstead of duplicating the same features for `Intern`, we unify both\ntypes as a new \"shared reference\" abstraction.  This is possible since\nthe compiler only really cares that the type implements `Deref` trait in\nRust for the pattern matching functionality.  We introduce a new\nannotation applicable to any extern type with exactly one type argument:\n\n ```\n #[shared_ref]\n extern type XXX<YYY>\n ```\n\nWe generalize the implementation of `&`-matching to work for all\n`shared_ref` types.", "committedDate": "2020-05-15T05:37:30Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "ce12259e395286ced8f2c0f92d7ff68abf429868", "url": "https://github.com/vmware/differential-datalog/commit/ce12259e395286ced8f2c0f92d7ff68abf429868", "message": "Compare interned values by pointer.\n\nWe change the implementnation of `Ord` and `PartialOrd` traits for\n`Intern` to compare pointers instead of actual values, which leads to\nmassive speed-ups, but introduces non-determinism across DDlog runs\n(see #663)", "committedDate": "2020-05-15T05:37:30Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "ce12259e395286ced8f2c0f92d7ff68abf429868", "url": "https://github.com/vmware/differential-datalog/commit/ce12259e395286ced8f2c0f92d7ff68abf429868", "message": "Compare interned values by pointer.\n\nWe change the implementnation of `Ord` and `PartialOrd` traits for\n`Intern` to compare pointers instead of actual values, which leads to\nmassive speed-ups, but introduces non-determinism across DDlog runs\n(see #663)", "committedDate": "2020-05-15T05:37:30Z", "type": "forcePushed"}]}
