To migrate an existing dataset to the new version, perform an export in the old system and use the exported files to import the content back into the new Snow Owl 7 version.\n+\n+## LDAP Authorization\n+\n+The new Snow Owl 7 version comes with complete authorization support using JWT authorization tokens. The old `User - Role - Permission` system can be used by performing the following migration steps:\n+\n+1. Add the administrator permission to all administrator roles: `*:*` \n+2. Remove the `unused` permission values from all roles used by Snow Owl\n+3. Add the `classify:*` permission declaration and assign it to all roles that should be able to run classifications\n+\n+## Configuration changes\n+\n+Snow Owl 7 configuration file has been renamed to `snowowl.yml` (from `snowowl_config.yml`) and moved to the `<HOME>/configuration` folder.\n+\n+The following configuration settings have been changed:\n+* `repository.database` configuration setting has been removed completely\n+* `repository.numberOfWorkers` has been renamed to `repository.maxThreads` and its default value became `200`.\n+* `metrics` settings has been renamed to `monitoring`", "originalCommit": "d49b79cb21dc399aebb1f81f2c1a36cce5069687", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4Mzk2NjQxNw==", "url": "https://github.com/b2ihealthcare/snow-owl/pull/499#discussion_r383966417", "bodyText": "Let's add it later.", "author": "cmark", "createdAt": "2020-02-25T15:50:14Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4MzkwMTgyNg=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "2e989ff6e4305a8d048cd69d59781b17dddab651", "url": "https://github.com/b2ihealthcare/snow-owl/commit/2e989ff6e4305a8d048cd69d59781b17dddab651", "message": "[scripts] remove db related scripts from assembly", "committedDate": "2020-02-25T14:50:40Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "0957d04570183a0ae48524b89ac3bfa684699b09", "url": "https://github.com/b2ihealthcare/snow-owl/commit/0957d04570183a0ae48524b89ac3bfa684699b09", "message": "[docs] add backup guide", "committedDate": "2020-02-25T14:58:09Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "3e4764d5263737c113447d2345d66aa671027993", "url": "https://github.com/b2ihealthcare/snow-owl/commit/3e4764d5263737c113447d2345d66aa671027993", "message": "[docs] update JDK links", "committedDate": "2020-02-25T15:49:45Z", "type": "commit"}]}
