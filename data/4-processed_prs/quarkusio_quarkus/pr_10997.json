container-image from your Quarkus application to leverage one of the container-image extensions.\n+\n+If one of those extensions is present, then creating a container image for the native executable

`quarkus.native.container-build=true` allows for creating a Linux executable without GraalVM being installed (and is only necessary if you don't have GraalVM installed locally or your local operating system is not Linux)\n+* `quarkus.container-image.build=true` instructs Quarkus to create a container-image using the final application artifact (which is the native executable in this case)\n+\n+See the link:container-image[Container Image guide] for more details.\n+\n+=== Manually\n+\n+You can run the application in a container using the JAR produced by the Quarkus Maven Plugin.\n+However, in this section we focus on creating a container image using the produced native executable.\n+\n+image:containerization-process.png[Containerization Process]\n+\n+When using a local GraalVM installation, the native executable targets your local operating system (Linux, macOS, Windows etc).\n+However, as a container may not use the same _executable_ format as the one produced by your operating system,\n+we will instruct the Maven build to produce an executable by leveraging a container runtime (as described in <<#container-runtime,this>> section):", "originalCommit":
