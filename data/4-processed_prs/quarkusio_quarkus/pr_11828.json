The order I'm talking about is as follows:\n\n\nThere are 2 separate extensions in play here - quarkus-rest-client and quarkus-resteasy.\n\n\nEach of them have multiple build steps (which is fine). Both of these extensions, in one of their build steps \"setup\" a @Recorder of their own to call some method which ultimately leads to a call to ResteasyProviderFactory.setInstance method. In case of the quarkus-rest-client extension, the recorder in question is the RestClientRecorder and for quarkus-resteasy extension it is the ResteasyStandaloneRecorder. So far all is fine.\n\n\nIn Quarkus, these recorders get invoked upon application initialization. It so happens that the order in which these are recorders are invoked isn't deterministic (from what I saw). So a few times the quarkus-resteasy recorder might get invoked first and in some cases the quarkus-rest-client recorder might get invoked first. Ultimately, whichever recorder gets invoked last \"wins\" the call to ResteasyProviderFactory.setInstance by overwriting the instance.\n\n\nThis issue still exists with this change because if the quarkus-rest-client recorder gets invoked first it will peek and see that the instance is null (assuming no other extension within the Quarkus ecosystem ended up setting it). Since it is null, it will go ahead and set the instance to clientProviderFactory. Now next, after a while, the quarkus-resteasy recorder gets invoked its recorder ultimately invokes certain method which leads to[1] which will overwrite this instance, which was set by the rest-client recorder.\nSo the ordering issue remains. Having said that, to answer this:\n\nTo my understanding, the only time there's a problem is when the server one is created first and the REST Client one clobbers it.\nI don't think the reverse situation poses any problems\n\nI'm not too sure, because outside of the current issue, I don't have much idea about how resteasy behaves internally with these provider factory instances.\n@gsmet, does ordering (via build item dependencies) of build steps (across extensions) also order their recorder execution?\n[1] https://github.com/resteasy/Resteasy/blob/4.5.6.Final/resteasy-core/src/main/java/org/jboss/resteasy/core/ResteasyDeploymentImpl.java#L373", "author": "jaikiran", "createdAt": "2020-09-03T06:49:36Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4MjMwMzE2Nw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4MjgwODI5NA==", "url": "https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/11828#discussion_r482808294", "bodyText": "@jaikiran the recorder executions will be executed in the order they are recorded.
