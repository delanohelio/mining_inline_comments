I think I understand why this happens now and why it didn't happen with my reproducer: your application does not have a dependency on the quarkus-smallrye-metrics module, so the metrics processor doesn't run and doesn't register the task to clean up registries during reload.\nBut what now? Is it correct that Jaeger registers metrics even if the application does not declare a dependency on quarkus-smallrye-metrics? In other extensions, we generally try to make their dependency on metrics optional, so metrics are activated only if the user explicitly adds the  quarkus-smallrye-metrics dependency.", "author": "jmartisk", "createdAt": "2020-04-09T09:12:47Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwMjc1OTM1OA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwNjA2ODQ4Mw==", "url": "https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/7987#discussion_r406068483", "bodyText": "And if we can't make changes to the Jaeger extension such that metrics become optional (and we can run without them completely), then I suppose we should make the Jaeger extension depend on quarkus-smallrye-metrics-deployment in order to make sure that the metrics processor is always applied and can do proper cleanup", "author": "jmartisk", "createdAt": "2020-04-09T09:16:11Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwMjc1OTM1OA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwNjA3NTEyMw==", "url": "https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/7987#discussion_r406075123", "bodyText": "It also happens that if the Metrics extension is not present (as in your reproducer), then metrics are not being exposed on the /metrics endpoint, so they are quite useless.", "author": "jmartisk", "createdAt": "2020-04-09T09:27:16Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwMjc1OTM1OA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwNjA4NzkwMg==", "url": "https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/7987#discussion_r406087902", "bodyText": "Now that is ... interesting. quarkus-jaeger depends on smallrye-metrics and microprofile-metrics-api, but not on quarkus-smallrye-metrics.
