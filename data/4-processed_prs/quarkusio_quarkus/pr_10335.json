This extension contains the `deployment`, `runtime` and `spi` modules\n+which can all be built by executing following command:\n+\n+```\n+./mvnw install -f extensions/jackson/\n+```\n+\n+This command uses the path of the extension on the filesystem to identify it. Moreover, Maven will automatically build all modules in that path recursively.\n+\n+#### Building a single module of an extension\n+\n+Let's say you want to make changes to the `deployment` module of the Jackson extension. There are two ways to accomplish this task as shown by the following commands:\n+\n+```\n+./mvnw install -f extensions/jackson/deployment\n+```\n+\n+or \n+\n+```\n+./mvnw install --projects 'io.quarkus:quarkus-jackson-deployment'", "originalCommit": "6ddcf18d0c9812a055c3ade2365fe9acc063d75f", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0NzcyNjk3Mw==", "url": "https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/10335#discussion_r447726973", "bodyText": "We have a similar tip, no?", "author": "geoand", "createdAt": "2020-06-30T14:27:51Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0NzcyMTk1NA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0NzczMDA5NA==", "url": "https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/10335#discussion_r447730094", "bodyText": "Do we?
