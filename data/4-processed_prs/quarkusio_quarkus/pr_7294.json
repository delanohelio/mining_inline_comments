if so you are right as it changes the contract.\nor are you concerned about lack of consistency where some calls will return null, and some calls will return an exception?\nI limited the change to readSecret() because that one seemed obvious, and I did not review all other methods, but it is very well possible that returning null might be more appropriate in other cases. the 2 other get are auth/token/lookup-self and database/creds/XX. lookup-self should not return a 404 because we are getting information on our own token. and I think that database/creds/XX leading to a 404 would be an actual error. but that is debatable.\nhow would you do it?
