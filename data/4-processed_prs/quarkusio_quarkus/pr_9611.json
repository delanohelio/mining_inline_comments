The Kotlin\n+language doesn't support the notion of static methods in quite the same way as Java does.  Instead, we use the\n+[companion object](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/kotlin-for-py/objects-and-companion-objects.html#companion-objects):\n+\n+[source,kotlin]\n+----\n+@Entity\n+class Person : PanacheEntity {\n+    companion object: PanacheCompanion<Person> {  // <1>\n+        fun findByName(name: String) = find(\"name\", name).firstResult()\n+        fun findAlive() = list(\"status\", Status.Alive)\n+        fun deleteStefs() = delete(\"name\", \"Stef\")\n+    }\n+\n+    lateinit var name: String  // <2>\n+    lateinit var birth: LocalDate\n+    lateinit var status: Status\n+}\n+----\n+<1> The companion object holds all the methods not related to a specific instance allowing for general management and\n+querying bound to a specific type.\n+<2> Here there are options, but we've chosen the `lateinit` approach.  This allows us to declare these fields as non-null\n+knowing they will be properly assigned either by the constructor (not shown) or by hibernate loading data from the\n+database.\n+\n+NOTE: Note that these types differ from the Java types mentioned in those tutorials.  For kotlin support, all the Panache\n+types will be found in the `io.quarkus.hibernate.orm.panache.kotlin` package.  This subpackage allows for the distinction\n+between the Java and Kotlin variants and allows for both to be used unambiguously in a single project.\n+\n+In the Kotlin version, we've simply moved the bulk of the link:https://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/activeRecord.html[`entity pattern`]\n+functionality to the `companion object`.  Apart from this slight change, we can then work with our types in ways that map easily\n+from the Java side of world.\n+\n+\n+== Using the repository pattern\n+\n+\n+=== Defining your entity\n+\n+When using the repository pattern, you can define your entities as regular JPA entities.\n+[source,kotlin]\n+----\n+@Entity\n+class Person {\n+    @Id\n+    @GeneratedValue\n+    var id: Long? = null;\n+    lateinit var name: String\n+    lateinit var birth: LocalDate\n+    lateinit var status: Status\n+}\n+----\n+\n+=== Defining your repository\n+\n+When using Repositories, you get the exact same convenient methods as with the active record pattern, injected in your Repository,\n+by making them implement `PanacheRepository`:\n+\n+[source,kotlin]\n+----\n+class PersonRepository: PanacheRepository<Person> {\n+     fun findByName(name: String) = find(\"name\", name).firstResult()\n+     fun findAlive() = list(\"status\", Status.Alive)\n+     fun deleteStefs() = delete(\"name\", \"Stef\")\n+}\n+----\n+\n+All the operations that are defined on `PanacheEntityBase` are available on your repository, so using it\n+is exactly the same as using the active record pattern, except you need to inject it:\n+\n+[source,kotlin]\n+----\n+@Inject\n+lateinit var personRepository: PersonRepository\n+\n+@GET\n+fun count() = personRepository.count()\n+----\n+\n+=== Most useful operations\n+\n+Once you have written your repository, here are the most common operations you will be able to perform:\n+\n+[source,kotlin]\n+----\n+// creating a person\n+var person: Person? = Person()", "originalCommit": "c0ab2195f2834e5217dd0178a88e612b5470f24a", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzMTg1OTQ0MQ==", "url": "https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/9611#discussion_r431859441", "bodyText": "Yeah, the only reason is the reuse below there.
