So uniqueness within each connector documentation should be enough, we don't create one large document with all the documentation at once. Indeed I think the slight inconsistency originates from downstream work, as the docs team has added the prefix to those files which feed into the downstream product.\nI.e. all good, thanks a lot again!", "author": "gunnarmorling", "createdAt": "2020-04-07T07:09:35Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwNDM4MTEwNg=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}]}
