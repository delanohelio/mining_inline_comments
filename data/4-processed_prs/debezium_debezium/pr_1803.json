broker.\n+However, in many cases, you might be interested in only a subset of the events emitted by the producer. \n+To enable you to process only the records that are relevant to you, {prodname} provides the _filter_ simple message transform (SMT).\n+\n+You configure the filter transformation in the {prodname} connector's Kafka Connect configuration.\n+In the configuration, you specify the events that you are interested in by defining filter conditions that are based on business rules.\n+As the filter SMT processes the event stream, it evaluates each event against the configured filter conditions.\n+Only events that meet the criteria of the filter conditions are passed to the broker.\n \n-With real-life applications, it is often necessary to deliver only a subset of events into the Kafka broker.\n-The user might need to filter the events according to different business rules.\n-Kafka Connect provides a generic mechanism to do the filtering in the form of link:https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-66%3A+Single+Message+Transforms+for+Kafka+Connect[Simple Message Transforms] (SMT).\n+The filter SMT supports scripting languages that integrate with https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=223[JSR 223] (Scripting for the Java(TM) Platform).\n \n-The SMT is a Java class that encodes the filtering logic.\n-This is a very powerful mechanism but has two drawbacks:\n+Kafka Connect provides its own link:https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-66%3A+Single+Message+Transforms+for+Kafka+Connect[Simple Message Transforms] (SMT) to encode filtering logic.\n+However, the following drawbacks apply to using the generic SMT:\n \n-* It is necessary to compile the transformation upfront and deploy it to Kafka Connect.\n+* It is necessary to compile the transformation up front and deploy it to Kafka Connect.\n * Every change needs code recompilation and redeployment, leading to inflexible operations.\n \n-To solve this problem, {prodname} comes with the Filtering SMT.\n-This SMT allows the operator to write an expression that is evaluated for each event and according to the result, it is either filtered out or passed on for further processing.\n-The current implementation supports any scripting language which integrates with https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=223[JSR 223] (Scripting for the Java(TM) Platform).\n \n-The Filtering SMT can be used like so:\n+// Type: concept\n+// ModuleID: example-of-configuring-filter-conditions\n+// Title: Example of configuring filter conditions \n+==
