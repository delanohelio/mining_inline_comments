If it does, perhaps we can find a better way to handle this for you guy.  From our perspective, this change is perfectly fine so I think we can live with it for now and let the downstream docs guys get back to us and we make further changes as we find are needed.", "author": "Naros", "createdAt": "2020-01-17T18:19:23Z", "path": "documentation/modules/ROOT/pages/modules/cdc-mysql-connector/c_how-the-mysql-connector-performs-database-snapshots.adoc", "diffHunk": "@@ -1,7 +1,6 @@\n // Metadata created by nebel\n //\n :isImageReady: false\n-:imagesdir: /assets/images", "originalCommit": "caa344fdcf58571b9ab0b7c92528f2e1efcdb551", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM2ODA3MTgyNg==", "url": "https://github.com/debezium/debezium/pull/1215#discussion_r368071826", "bodyText": "IIRC, @fbolton also was advocating for removing those attributes from individual files to avoid the redundancy.", "author": "gunnarmorling", "createdAt": "2020-01-17T18:20:53Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM2ODA3MTI0Nw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM2ODA5NzQ5Nw==", "url": "https://github.com/debezium/debezium/pull/1215#discussion_r368097497", "bodyText": "To solve it in the source, one could use ifdef macros.
