This worked correctly for the repository because there\nonly the ALv2 is present, but a source config build in the LICENSE file\nalso the references to the license files for the embedded source files\nwith foreign licenses are included.\n\nA binary build from a source config thus contains the license info of\nthe source config _and_ the binary build. This is not correct, as the\nbinary config can contains less source only files because they are only\nrequired at build time.\n\nTo fix this, a new license-stub.txt is introduced, that only contains\nthe ALv2 regardless whether it comes from the repository or from a\nsource config build.", "committedDate": "2020-02-20T20:31:23Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4MjM5OTM1OA==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1957#discussion_r382399358", "bodyText": "A very, very minor nit..
