See [http://kb.vmware.com/kb/1001805](http://kb.vmware.com/kb/1001805) for details on selecting the appropriate type of virtual NIC for your virtual machine.\n     -   VMXNET3 supports adaptive interrupt coalescing that can help drive high throughput to virtual machines that have multiple vCPUs with parallelized workloads (multiple threads), while minimizing latency of virtual interrupt delivery. However, if your workload is extremely sensitive to latency, VMware recommends that you disable virtual interrupt coalescing for your virtual NICs. You can do this programmatically via API or by editing your virtual machine's .vmx configuration file. Refer to your vSphere API Reference or VMware ESXi documentation for specific instructions.\n \n ## <a id=\"topic_E6EB8AB6CCEF435A98B48B867FE9BFEB\" class=\"no-quick-link\"></a>VMware vSphere vMotion and DRS Cluster Usage\n \n-This topic discusses use limitations of vSphere vMotion, including the use of it with DRS.\n+This topic discusses use limitations of vSphere vMotion, including its use with DRS.\n+\n+When vMotion migrations occur, there is an expected temporary drop in the performance of both read-operation and write-operation workloads.\n+These workloads resume their normal rate of operation once the vMotion migration of the servers is completed.\n+\n+VMware recommends that all vMotion migration activity of <%=vars.product_name_long%> members occurs over 10GbE, during periods of low activity and scheduled maintenance windows.\n+Test vMotion migrations in your own environment to assess differences in workload, networking and scale.", "originalCommit": "09ad2cfb812a68c888171090d95eebb5f1ac28fa", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "81cec566b4327f1c83cd175ccc2a76793d8c97a2", "url": "https://github.com/apache/geode/commit/81cec566b4327f1c83cd175ccc2a76793d8c97a2", "message": "GEODE-7686: incorporate reviewer correction", "committedDate": "2020-01-14T00:56:01Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "08d52af22bc17830a7f8fecb16d949fea197cdf7", "url": "https://github.com/apache/geode/commit/08d52af22bc17830a7f8fecb16d949fea197cdf7", "message": "GEODE-7686: incorporate reviewer correction", "committedDate": "2020-01-14T01:32:29Z", "type": "commit"}]}
