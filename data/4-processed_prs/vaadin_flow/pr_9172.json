I was also thinking about using a Custom Condition in the beginning, but then realized that we are already scanning the Endpoints at build time, so we can just reuse that instead of having another check in a custom condition.\nAlso for an extreme case, if there is only one class that has @Endpoint annotation, but without any public methods, then the annotation scanning-based custom condition would still active the Vaadin controller while the solution in this PR won't.\nAnother big reason is what you mentioned, we might remove the spring dependency in the future, so the check won't be necessary, thus like to have a minimal effort solution.", "author": "haijian-vaadin", "createdAt": "2020-10-14T11:59:49Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwNDYwNzI0Mg=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwNjI5Njc2MA==", "url": "https://github.com/vaadin/flow/pull/9172#discussion_r506296760", "bodyText": "Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n                public static final String VAADIN_ENDPINT_ENABLED = \"endpoint.enabled\";\n          \n          \n            \n                public static final String VAADIN_ENDPOINT_ENABLED = \"endpoint.enabled\";\n          \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\nThere's a typo in the constant.
