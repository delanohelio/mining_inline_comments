Those are cases that are known to correspond to a Java application program explicitly posting a read or write to Java data. The relaxing of the semantics in these cases is compatible with the optimization implemented by PR 1772 when UseBarriersForVolatile is false and improves performance. Or rather it will be when 1772 is merged and we can omit the trailing barriers that are still in place for this patch.\nIn other cases where code internal to the JIT or Substrate creates an UnsafeCompareAndSwapNode or UnsafeCompareAndExchangeNode via the original constructor the value defaults to false which means the generator uses a more heavyweight barrier-based translation. This alternative is always consistent (on all known AArch64 arches) whether or not PR 1772 is in place. It is just less performant.\nThe reason the other cases have not been changed to use ldaxr/stlxr  is because it was not clear whether these internal uses were expecting other accesses to the target locations to be simple Java volatile field reads and writes (which would be correctly handled by the JIT once PR 1772 was merged) or to require the full semantics that is normally expected for compare and swap. The idea was to leave them as is and then convert the relevant uses one by one as needed.

Add a \"conservative\" field for \"LocationIdentity\" to decide whether to\n     use the full semantic barriers for VM internal atomic operations.\n  2. Always use the optimized \"ldaxr/stlxr\" pattern for java atomics.\n  3. Temporarily insert a full barrier after STLXR for the normal atomics to\n     make the Renaissance benchmark work well. This can be removed once \"LDAR\"\n     is used for java volatile read (See [4]).\n\n[1] https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/3575821/\n[2] https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8179954\n[3] https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/2045\n[4] https://github.com/oracle/graal/pull/1772\n\nChange-Id: Ifa57c9733b1dd1a2e2208e885a11932475a4e3b0", "committedDate": "2020-05-14T02:21:27Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"oid": "2f01e36c3eb0328d00058eb4d627be84850e6673", "url": "https://github.com/oracle/graal/commit/2f01e36c3eb0328d00058eb4d627be84850e6673", "message": "AArch64: Add the full barrier implementation support for CAS.\n\nGraal always uses \"LDAXR+STLXR\" for Unsafe atomic operations.
