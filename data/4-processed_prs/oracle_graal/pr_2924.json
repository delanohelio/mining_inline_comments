The idea of LSPExtensions is that they can parse, evaluate, and instrument code within the context of the GraalLS. Of course, we could hide some of Env's functionality similar to how the LSPServerAccessor hides information. For our tools, we currently only need #getInstrumenter(), #parse(), and #parseInline().\nBTW: I wonder, can't other instruments just create Context objects through the Graal SDK and do arbitrary instrumentation? I mean all instruments must be trusted, right?", "author": "fniephaus", "createdAt": "2020-10-23T15:01:28Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxMDkwMDE1OQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}]}
