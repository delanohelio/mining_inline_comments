It may be merged after a 24hours if there is no negative feedback`\n+\n+**Step 3: Merge!**.\n+A Core Maintainer merges the change after a timeout (if needed).\n+After that the change will be landed in the next weekly release unless it gets reverted later.\n+LTS Backporting, if needed, will be handled separately by the release team.\n+\n+=== Exceptions\n+\n+* Jenkins Security Team uses a different process for security issue fixes.\n+  They are reviewed and integrated by the Security team in private repositories.\n+  Security hardening and enhancements go through the standard process.\n+* Release Team members are permitted to bypass the review/merge process if and only if a change is needed to unblock the security release.\n+  Common review process is used otherwise.\n+* 24 hours timeout after `ready-for-merge` is not required for...\n+//TODO(oleg_nenashev): Define \"trivial\" better to avoid loopholes\n+** trivial changes like typo fixes or minor Javadoc improvements\n+**

separate commit),\n+   but we can live without it if there is no need to backport changes to the stable baseline.\n+\n+== Merge process\n+\n+=== Common merge process\n+\n+**Step 1: Maintainer checklist**. Merge process can be initiated once a pull request matches the requirements:\n+\n+* Pull request is compliant with requirements to submitters (see the link:/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md[pull request template])\n+* There are at least 2 approvals for the pull request and no outstanding requests for change\n+* Conversations in the pull request are over OR it is explicit that a reviewer does not block the change (often indicated by line comments attached to an approving PR review, or by using the term \"nit\", from \"nit-picking\")\n+* Changelog entries in the PR title and/or `Proposed changelog entries` are correct and reflect the current, final state of the PR\n+* Proper changelog labels are set so that the changelog can be generated automatically\n+* If the change needs administrators to be aware of it when upgrading, the `upgrade-guide-needed` label is present. This is usually the case when a data migration occurs, a feature has been removed, a significant behavior change is introduced (including when there is a way to opt out), or in general when we expect at least a large minority of admins to benefit from knowing about the change, e.g. to apply a new option.\n+  and there is a `Proposed upgrade guidelines` section in the PR title.\n+  (link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/4387[example])\n+* It would make sense to backport the change to LTS, a Jira issue should exist and be labeled as `lts-candidate`\n+\n+**Step 2: Marking for merge**. Once the checklist is passed,\n+a Core PR Reviewer or a Maintainer can mark the pull request for merge.\n+\n+* `ready-for-merge` label is set\n+* An explicit comment is added to the pull request so that other repository watchers are notified.\n+  Example: `Thanks to all contributors!

Release officer\n+\n+== Pull request review process\n+\n+Jenkins core is a mission-critical part of the ecosystem.\n+We need to ensure that submitted pull requests are not only code complete,\n+but also that they do not introduce undesired defects, breaking changes and technical debt.\n+At the same time, we are interested to make the review process as simple as possible for contributors and maintainers.\n+\n+=== Code review goals\n+\n+There are the following code review goals:\n+\n+* Ensure that the pull request is feasible and that it fits the Jenkins ecosystem\n+* Verify compatibility of the suggested changes\n+* Ensure that the pull request matches the code quality practices: test automation, Javadoc for newly introduced APIs, etc.\n+* Ensure that the pull request contains appropriate changelogs and, if needed, upgrade guidelines.\n+* Ensure there is a consensus among reviewers about all items above \n+\n+**Feasibility**.\n+Reviewers are expected to look at changes critically from a \"product management\" point of view.\n+It's not just about the code, but also whether the change makes sense in a global / holistic way, considering existing popular plugins and the way users experience Jenkins overall.\n+Also, not every change needs to be merged into the core.\n+Many features would be better introduced as plugins which have separate release cycles and allow delivering changes faster.\n+We want to extend the Jenkins core and incorporate widely used functionality and extension points there,\n+but we try to keep the core as minimal as possible in terms of dependencies.\n+\n+**Compatibility**.\n+The Jenkins project has a long history of backward compatibility.\n+We accept breaking changes when it is needed (security fixes, feature deprecation and

_compatibility_ of the suggested changes\n+* Ensure that the pull request matches the _code quality_ practices: test automation, Javadoc for newly introduced APIs, etc.\n+* Ensure that the pull request contains appropriate changelogs and, if needed, upgrade guidelines.\n+* Ensure there is a _consensus_ among reviewers about all items above.\n+\n+**Feasibility**.\n+Reviewers are expected to look at changes critically from a \"product management\" point of view.\n+It's not just about the code, but also whether the change makes sense in a global / holistic way, considering existing popular plugins and the way users experience Jenkins overall.\n+Also, not every change needs to be merged into the core.\n+Many features would be better introduced as plugins which have separate release cycles and allow delivering changes faster.\n+We want to extend the Jenkins core and incorporate widely used functionality and extension points there,\n+but we try to keep the core as minimal as possible in terms of dependencies.\n+\n+**Compatibility**.\n+The Jenkins project has a long history of backward compatibility.\n+We accept breaking changes when it is needed (security fixes, feature deprecation and removal, etc.),\n+but ultimately the project's goal is retain as much compatibility as possible.\n+It includes both feature compatibility and binary/API compatibility which is important for the plugin ecosystem.\n+Although we have some tools (like https://github.com/jenkins-infra/usage-in-plugins[usage-in-plugins]) for checking API usages across open-source plugins,\n+there is no way to confirm external usages in 3rd-party proprietary plugins which is also a part of the ecosystem.\n+\n+**Code quality**.\n+The code doesn't have to be perfect, but we want to ensure that all new code matches basic quality standards:\n+test coverage for newly added functionality and fixes,\n+documentation for newly introduced APIs,\n+the submitted code is readable and matches the code style in the surrounding codebase,\n+etc.\n+\n+**Consensus**.\n+Not all changes are discussed before they submitted as pull requests.\n+Developer mailing lists, Jira issues and JEPs are used for discussions,\n+but sometimes the changes go straight to the pull requests.\n+And we are fine with that, especially for small patches.\n+Pull requests often become a venue to discuss feasibility, underlying technical decisions and design.\n+We are fine with that as well.\n+If there is no consensus about the feasibility and implementation,\n+code reviewers are expected to suggest proper channels for contributors to discuss their contribution.\n+\n+* A discussion in the link:https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-dev[Jenkins Developer Mailing List] is the default way to go\n+* If

help them to get their changes integrated, but it needs cooperation on both sides.\n+  It is **fine** to close invalid and inactive pull requests if there is no activity by a submitter or other

expert, do not request changes in the commit history unless it is necessary\n+** Core maintainers can squash PRs during the merge.\n+   If you feel this is important, add the [squash-merge-me](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3Asquash-merge-me) label\n+** We want to keep pull requests focused when possible (one feature / fix per pull request),\n+   but we can live without it if there is no need to backport changes to the stable baseline.\n+\n+== Merge process\n+\n+=== Common merge process\n+\n+==== Step 1: Maintainer checklist\n+\n+Merge process can be initiated once a pull request matches the requirements:\n+\n+* Pull request is compliant with requirements to submitters (see the link:/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md[pull request template])\n+* There are at least 2 approvals for the pull request and no outstanding requests for change\n+* Conversations in the pull request are over OR it is explicit that a reviewer does not block the change (often indicated by line comments attached to an approving PR review, or by using the term \"nit\", from \"nit-picking\")\n+* Changelog entries in the PR title and/or _Proposed changelog entries_ are correct and reflect the current, final state of the PR\n+* Proper changelog labels are set so that the changelog can be generated automatically.\n+ List of labels we use for changelog generation is available link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/.github/blob/master/.github/release-drafter.yml[here].\n+* If the change needs administrators to be aware of it when upgrading, the `upgrade-guide-needed` label is present\n+  and there is a `Proposed upgrade guidelines` section in the PR title\n+  (link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/4387[example]).\n+  This is usually the case when a data migration occurs, a feature has been removed, a significant behavior change is introduced (including when there is a way to opt out),\n+  or in general when we expect at least a large minority of admins to benefit from knowing about the change, e.g. to apply a new option.\n+* If it would make sense to backport the change to LTS, a Jira issue must exist, be a _Bug_ or _Improvement_, and be labeled as `lts-candidate` to be considered (see [query](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/issues/?filter=12146)).\n+\n+==== Step 2: Is it a good time to merge?\n+\n+link:[https://jenkins.io/security/](Jenkins security updates) are coordinated with the LTS calendar, and if the weekly release on the weekend before an LTS release introduces regressions, users of the weekly line may have to choose between security fixes, and a working Jenkins.\n+The Jenkins security team will usually send a \"pre-announcement\" to link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jenkinsci-advisories[the advisories list] on Wednesday or Thursday the week before release, but that's not always doable.\n+For these reasons, the following changes should not be merged during the week before LTS releases (weeks 3, 7, 11, 15, etc. on the page linked above):\n+\n+* Changes that could be considered risky (relatively high risk of introducing regressions), as they could make users of Jenkins weekly releases choose between getting security fixes, and having a functioning Jenkins\n+* Very large changes (in terms of lines changed), because the Jenkins security team needs to prepare security fixes for the weekly release line in a very short period of time.\n+\n+If the change is ready but it is not a good time, consider labeling the pull request with the `on-hold` label.\n+Make sure to add a comment explaining why it was put on hold.\n+\n+==== Step 3: Marking for merge\n+\n+Once the checklist is passed, a Core PR Reviewer or a Maintainer can mark the pull request for merge.\n+\n+* `ready-for-merge` label is set\n+* An explicit comment is added to the pull request so that other repository watchers are notified.\n+  Example: _Thanks to all contributors! We consider this change as ready to be merged towards the next weekly release.
