the issue (though they are welcome to do so!).\n+  The main goal is to ensure that an issue report is legitimate and that it contains enough information to be processed.\n+  It is fine to request

link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting#reporting-issues[Reporting Jenkins Remoting issues]\n+* **Verify the issue component**.\n+  It is essential to ensure that the `component` field references the right component (the Jenkins core, a plugin, etc.)\n+  so that an issue is discoverable processed by a component maintainer.\n+  When moving an issue, assign the issue to the `automatic` assignee so that the maintainer gets notification.\n+  Not all components have a default assignee, and it is perfectly fine to leave the assignee empty.\n+* **Verify the issue type**.\n+  `Bug` should be used for bug reports.\n+  All other issue types are considered as requests for enhancements, and there is no practical difference for the Jenkins core.\n+* **Verify the issue metadata**: Jenkins version, environment, labels, etc.\n+  Such metadata is useful for further triage and issue discoverability.\n+  There are some labels used in Jenkins Jira dashboard and filters, e.g. `jcasc-compatibility`, `java11-compatibility`, `jep-200`, etc.\n+  Assigning such labels helps users and maintainers to discover issues and act on them.\n+  There is no list of such \"common labels\" recommended for use.\n+  Some labels can be found in similar issues or documentation linked from system log entries in the reports.\n+* **Move security issue** to the `SECURITY` project.\n+  Sometimes the issue reporters do not follow the link:https://www.jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities[vulnerability reporting] process and report security issues in public.\n+  If you see such issues, move them to the `SECURITY` project so that the security team takes care of their triage.\n+* **Label regressions and CC stakeholders** if an issue is reported as a regression with a clear root cause,\n+  please set a `regression` label and, if applicable, CC contributors of a change which led to the regression.\n+* **Resolve invalid issues and support requests**.\n+  Sometimes Jenkins Jira is used as a support portal.\n+  We do not want to encourage that.\n+  Jenkins Jira is an issue tracker, and we expect reporters to investigate issues on their side to an extent that they can be followed-up by maintainers.\n+  For support requests users are expected to use link:https://www.jenkins.io/mailing-lists[mailing lists],\n+  link:https://www.jenkins.io/chat/[chats] and other resources (e.g.

reported in the Jenkins database.\n+  Newly reported duplicates can be just resolved with a `Duplicate` resolution, and linked to the original issue.\n+\n+=== HOWTO: Triage by maintainers\n+\n+Further triage focuses on confirming the issue and defining a potential resolution.\n+It can be performed by _Issue Triage Team Members_ if they want to dive deeper,\n+or they can leave it to component maintainers.\n+Triage objectives:\n+\n+* **Confirm reported defects**. Try to reproduce the issue or analyze the codebase.\n+  If the issue is legit, it is great to explicitly confirm it in a comment.\n+* Nice2Have: **Define next steps**.\n+  If possible, define a potential resolution for the issue.\n+  If you do not plan to work on the issue in foreseeable future,\n+  it is great to explicitly highlight that by unassigning the issue and inviting the reporter and other contributors to submit a fix.\n+* Nice2Have: **Highlight newcomer-friendly issues**.\n+  Newcomer-friendly issues are instrumental for an onboarding new code contributors to the project.\n+  They are linked from link:https://www.jenkins.io/participate/code/[contributing guidelines].\n+  If you see a simple issue but do not plan to work on it,\n+  put a `newbie-friendly` label on it so that somebody could pick it up.\n+\n+=== How to scrub issues?\n+\n+In addition to the initial triage, it is a good practice to sometimes review previously reported issues so that we could minimize backlog of issues and simplify search by users.\n+\n+* **Triage reopened issues**.\n+  Same as for newly reported issues, it is great to process reopened issues if they are not acted on by the issue assignees.\n+  Often such issues can be resolved with a request to report a new issue if an issue is reopened due to another issue.\n+* **Resolve stale untriaged issues**.\n+  Issue reporters may become unresponsive before their issue can be fully triaged.\n+  If there is a reported issue which does not contain data for reproducing the issue,\n+  it is fine to resolve them after a 2-week timeout with the `Incomplete` or `Cannot reproduce` resolution.\n+* **Resolve/update obsolete issues**.\n+  Sometimes issues become obsolete due to other changes in the Jenkins core (e.g. feature removal),\n+  and such issues can be just closed.\n+  Same for detaching functionality from the Jenkins core and plugins,\n+  issues can be reassigned to the new Jira component so that they do not longer appear in the core backlog.\n+\n+=== Triaging requests for enhancement\n+\n+Requests for enhancement (RFEs) include the `New Feature` and `Improvement` types in Jenkins Jira.\n+They might be more different to triage than bug reports.\n+because it is not always possible to say whether a request should be implemented in the Jenkins core,\n+an existing or a new plugin.\n+In the case of doubt, it is fine to just skip an issue or CC subject matter experts who could advice.\n+\n+For RFEs which are not related to the Jenkins core or plugins,\n+it is possible to set the `plugin-proposals` component.\n+Note that this component is not regularly scrubbed,\n+and it can be considered only as a pool of ideas somebody could implement.\n+It is a good practice to set expectation in a comment when updating the RFE.\n+\n+=== Responding to pings in triaged issues\n+\n+Some submitters and users tend to ping triage contributors to ask about the fix ETA.\n+In some cases, they may also assign the issue and keep pinging.\n+It is fine to not answer these questions on such pings and to refer requestors to this document,\n+triage team members are not responsible for handling the ticket after initial triage.\n+\n+Other materials which might help:\n+\n+* link:https://www.jenkins.io/participate/code/[Contribute to Jenkins / Code] or \n+  link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md[Contributing to the Jenkins Core] - \n+  extended version of \"feel free to contribute\".\n+*

link:https://www.jenkins.io/project/conduct/[Jenkins Code of Conduct] -\n+when it gets ugly.\n+\n+=== Resolving vs. Closing issues\n+\n+Jira workflow for the `JENKINS` project has two similar states: `Resolved` and `Closed`.\n+Historically the issues are rarely being **closed**, and all dashboard and Jenkins processes interpret resolved issues as closed.\n+The main difference is that the _Resolved_ issues can e reopened by users while _Closed_ ones can be reopened by admins only.", "originalCommit": "68add7f167db643b9f0285ad0388a3e498ff6d50", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null,

issue can be discovered and processed by a component maintainer.\n+  When moving an issue, assign the issue to the `automatic` assignee so that the maintainer gets notification.\n+  Not all components have a default assignee, and it is perfectly fine to leave the assignee empty.\n+* **Verify the issue type**.\n+  `Bug` should be used for bug reports.\n+  All other issue types are considered as requests for enhancements, and there is no practical difference for the Jenkins core.\n+* **Verify the issue metadata**: Jenkins version, environment, labels, etc.\n+  Such metadata is useful for further triage and issue discoverability.\n+  There are some labels used in Jenkins Jira dashboard and filters, e.g. `jcasc-compatibility`, `java11-compatibility`, `jep-200`, etc.\n+  Assigning such labels helps users and maintainers to discover issues and act on them.\n+  There is no list of such \"common labels\" recommended for use.\n+  Some labels can be found in similar issues or documentation linked from system log entries in the reports.\n+* **Move security issue** to the `SECURITY` project.\n+  Sometimes the issue reporters do not follow the link:https://www.jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities[vulnerability reporting] process and report security issues in public.\n+  If you see such issues, move them to the `SECURITY` project so that the security team takes care of their triage.\n+* **Label regressions and CC stakeholders** if an issue is reported as a regression with a clear root cause,\n+  please set a `regression` label and, if applicable, CC contributors of a change which led to the regression.\n+* **Resolve invalid issues and support requests**.\n+  Sometimes Jenkins Jira is used as a support portal.\n+  We do not want to encourage that.\n+  Jenkins Jira is an issue tracker, and we expect reporters to investigate issues on their side to an extent that they can be reviewed by maintainers.\n+  For support requests users are expected to use link:https://www.jenkins.io/mailing-lists[mailing lists],\n+  link:https://www.jenkins.io/chat/[chats] and other resources (e.g. Stackoverflow).\n+  It is fine to link users to link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/.github/blob/master/SUPPORT.md[this page]. \n+* **Resolve duplicates**.\n+  It is often that the same issue is already reported in the Jenkins database.\n+  Newly reported duplicates can be just resolved with a `Duplicate` resolution, and linked to the original issue.\n+\n+=== HOWTO: Triage by maintainers\n+\n+Further triage focuses on confirming the issue and defining a potential resolution.\n+It can be performed by _Issue Triage Team Members_ if they want to dive deeper,\n+or they can leave it to component maintainers.\n+\n+Triage objectives:\n+\n+* **Confirm reported defects**. Try to reproduce the issue or analyze the codebase.\n+  If the issue is legitimate, it is great to explicitly confirm it in a comment.\n+* Nice2Have: **Define next steps**.\n+  If possible, define a potential resolution for the issue.\n+  If you do not plan to work on the issue in foreseeable future,\n+  it is great to explicitly highlight that by unassigning the issue and inviting the reporter and other contributors to submit a fix.\n+* Nice2Have: **Highlight newcomer-friendly issues**.\n+  Newcomer-friendly issues are instrumental for an onboarding new code contributors to the project.\n+  They are linked from link:https://www.jenkins.io/participate/code/[contributing guidelines].\n+  If you see a simple issue but do not plan to work on it,\n+  put a `newbie-friendly` label on it so that somebody could pick it up.\n+\n+=== How to scrub issues?\n+\n+In addition to the initial triage, it is a good practice to sometimes review previously reported issues so that we could minimize backlog of issues and simplify search by users.\n+\n+* **Triage reopened issues**.\n+  Same as for newly reported issues, it is great to process reopened issues if they are not acted on by the issue assignees.\n+  Often such issues can be resolved with a request to report a new issue if an issue is reopened due to another issue.\n+* **Resolve stale untriaged issues**.\n+  Issue reporters may become unresponsive before their issue can be fully triaged.\n+  If there is a reported issue which does not contain data for reproducing the issue,\n+  it is fine to resolve them after a 2-week timeout with the `Incomplete` or `Cannot reproduce` resolution.\n+* **Resolve/update obsolete issues**.\n+  Sometimes issues become obsolete due to other changes in the Jenkins core (e.g. feature removal),\n+  and such issues can be closed.\n+  Same for detaching functionality from the Jenkins core and plugins,\n+  issues can be reassigned to the new Jira component so that they are removed from the core backlog.\n+\n+=== Triaging requests for enhancement\n+\n+Requests for enhancement (RFEs) include the `New Feature` and `Improvement` types in Jenkins Jira.\n+They might be more different to triage than bug reports.", "originalCommit": "001027419b9e907ea16594ca482be93a07226df2", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "b68413e937e06db8796a520fd7143bf6f85429f1", "url": "https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/b68413e937e06db8796a520fd7143bf6f85429f1", "message": "Update docs/MAINTAINERS.adoc", "committedDate": "2020-07-14T13:40:23Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "9c7de437ea8191ddaf5b7fbbc0f15ad9af09f6e5", "url": "https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/9c7de437ea8191ddaf5b7fbbc0f15ad9af09f6e5", "message": "Apply suggestions from code review\n\nCo-authored-by: stellargo <sumitsarinofficial@gmail.com>", "committedDate": "2020-07-14T13:41:20Z", "type": "commit"}]}
