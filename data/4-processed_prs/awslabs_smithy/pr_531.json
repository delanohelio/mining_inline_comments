However, the internal/external split is so common that it\nmakes sense to make it a trait, which is more configurable and less\nbased on convention. Tags can still be used for filtering things out of\nmodels (for example, an operation could be tagged so that it is only\nexposed to a particular customer).\n\nThere are other cases where we migrated away from tags and moved to\ntraits like the `aws.api#controlPlane` and `aws.api#dataPlane` traits.\n\nTo support this change, a SmithyBuild transform was added that removes\nshapes marked as internal. Note that this does not perform tree shaking\nsince like other transforms, tree shaking is performed by a dedicated\ntransform.", "committedDate": "2020-08-18T16:43:09Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ3MjM3NDgwOQ==", "url": "https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/531#discussion_r472374809", "bodyText": "Should this be a list of traits instead?
