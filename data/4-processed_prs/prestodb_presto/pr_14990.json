This might have performance implication.\nAlways use FeaturesConfig#isLegacyDateTimestampToVarcharCoercion. The downside is that all non-injected class would have to change constructor to adopt this. The fanout is non-trivial given there are a lot of static method trying to create ExpressionAnalyzer.\nAdd session property to determine if we want to check for warning, but does not put it into SqlFunctionProperties. This means a lot of ExpressionCompiler related class (and their caller) needs to be changed, specifically, it changes all CacheKey-like classes. The fanout is also non-trivial.\nAdd this session property into SqlFunctionProperties, which seems to be the cleanest way, and there are several session property already resides in this class.", "author": "shixuan-fan", "createdAt": "2020-08-10T22:25:07Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2NzczMjA5Nw=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}]}
