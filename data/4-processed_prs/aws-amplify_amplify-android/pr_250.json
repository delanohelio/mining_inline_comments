Since IllegalStateException derives from RuntimeException, the caller still won't need to try-catch it explicitly.\nHowever, I didn't honestly know the best practice on this. Should one put runtime exceptions on the method signature, or not? Apparently, the guidance is to not do this. Here's a StackOverflow post about it, which contains this quote from Oracle documentation:\n\nHaving to add runtime exceptions in every method declaration would reduce a program's clarity.\n\nAnyway, these are all over the code-base at this point.
