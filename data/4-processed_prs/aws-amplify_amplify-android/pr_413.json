Save, query, and observe changes to your data\n+from a local repository. Let DataStore synchronize your local data with\n+the Cloud. Our default implemenation syncs local data to/from a DynamoDB\n+database, via an AppSync front-end.\n+\n+### [REST APIs](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/restapi/getting-started/q/platform/android):\n+\n+Easy auth and request signing against multiple REST endpoints. Our\n+default plugin works great with Amazon API Gateway.\n+\n+### [GraphQL APIs](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/graphqlapi/getting-started/q/platform/android)\n+\n+Data modeling and simple auth against GraphQL endpoints. Our default\n+plugin targets Amazon AppSync.\n \n-If you're new to the project, checkout the [Getting Started Guide](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/android/start).\n+### [Analytics](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/analytics/getting-started/q/platform/android):\n \n-## Features/APIs\n+Collect and report usage data for your app. Our default plugin\n+communicates with Amazon Pinpoint.\n \n-- [**Analytics**](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/analytics/getting-started?platform=android): Easily collect and report usage data for your app.\n-- [**API**](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/graphqlapi/getting-started?platform=android): An interface for interacting with REST and GraphQL endpoints. Provides AWS Signature Version 4 signing.\n-- [**DataStore**](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/datastore/getting-started?platform=android): Provides a persistent on-device storage repository for you to write, read, and observe changes to data. Data is sycnhronized to the cloud as well as across devices.\n-- [**Storage**](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/storage/getting-started?platform=android): Manage user content for your app, storing it in public, protected or private buckets.\n+### [Storage](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/storage/getting-started/q/platform/android):\n+\n+Store and retrieve files in the Cloud. We use S3 by default.\n \n ## Platform Support\n \n-Amplify SDK supports Android API level 16 (Android 4.1) and above.\n+The Amplify Framework supports Android API level 16 (android 4.1) and above.\n \n-## Installation\n+## Using Amplify from Your App\n \n-### Using Gradle\n+### Specifying Gradle Dependencies\n \n-To use Amplify, specify which modules you want to use inside of your app's `build.gradle` dependencies section:\n+To begin, include Amplify from your `app` module's `build.gradle`\n+dependencies section:\n \n ```gradle\n dependencies {\n-    // Specify only the modules that the app will use\n+    // Only specify modules that provide functionality your app will use\n     implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-datastore:0.10.0'\n     implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-api:0.10.0'\n     implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-storage-s3:0.10.0'\n     implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-analytics-pinpoint:0.10.0'\n }\n ```\n \n-### Local Publishing of Artifacts\n-\n-You can manually install the library by cloning this repo and publishing the Android modules to the local maven repository.\n+### Java 8 Compatibility\n \n-Execute following commands from the project root:\n+Amplify Android uses Java 8 features. Please add a `compileOptions`\n+block inside your app's `build.gradle`, as below:\n \n-```\n-./gradlew publishToMavenLocal\n+```gradle\n+android {\n+    compileOptions {\n+        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8\n+        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8\n+    }\n+}\n ```\n \n-Locally published artifacts can be accessed by specifying `mavenLocal()` inside the app's `build.gradle` file:\n+### AWS Mobile Client\n \n-``` gradle\n-buildscript {\n-    repositories {\n-        mavenLocal() // This should ideally appear before other repositories\n-    }\n-    dependencies {\n-        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.6.1'\n+The default plugins for Amplify Android rely on the AWS Mobile Client to\n+provide authentication with AWS services.\n+\n+Please see [Getting Started with Authentication](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/auth/getting-started?platform=android)\n+for full details.\n+\n+In summary, you need to ensure `AWSMobileClient` is [initialized](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/auth/getting-started/q/platform/android#initialization)\n+before interfacting with `Amplify`:\n+\n+```\n+AWSMobileClient awsAuth = AWSMobileClient.getInstance();\n+Context context = getApplicationContext();\n+awsAuth.initialize(context, new Callback<UserStateDetails>() {\n+    @Override\n+    public void onResult(UserStateDetails userStateDetails) {\n+        Amplify.addPlugin(new AWSApiPlugin()); // For example\n+        Amplify.configuration(context);\n+        Toast.makeText(context, \"OK!\", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT);\n     }\n-}\n \n-allprojects {\n-    repositories {\n-        mavenLocal() // This should ideally appear before other repositories\n+    @Override\n+    public void onError(Exception error) {\n+        Toast.makeText(context, \"Uh oh...\", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT);\n     }\n-}\n+});\n ```\n \n-## Using Amplify\n+Please note that `AWSMobileClient` initialization is ___not___ required\n+when using the `AWSApiPlugin` or `AWSDataStorePlugin` with _api key_ as the\n+authorization mode.\n \n-### Java 8 Compatibility\n+## License\n \n-Amplify Android uses Java 8 features.

Please add compile options inside app's `build.gradle` like following:\n+## License\n \n-``` gradle\n-android {\n-    compileOptions {\n-        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8\n-        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8\n-    }\n-}\n-```\n+This library is licensed under the [Apache 2.0 License](./LICENSE).\n \n-### Using AWS Mobile Client\n+## Report a Bug\n \n-Amplify relies on the AWS Mobile Client for authentication with AWS services. Please refer to the [this documentation](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/auth/getting-started?platform=android) for details.\n+We appreciate your feedback -- comments, questions, and bug reports. Please\n+[submit a GitHub issue](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-android/issues),\n+and we'll get back to you.\n \n-You need to ensure `AWSMobileClient` is [initialized](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/auth/getting-started?platform=android#initialization) before you initalize and configure `Amplify`. Please note that AWSMobileClient initialization is not required when using API or DataStore category with _API Key_ as the authorization mode.\n+## Contribute to the Project\n \n-## License\n+Please see the [Contributor's Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).\n \n-This library is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License. \n+--------------------------------\n \n+[amplify.aws](https://amplify.aws)", "originalCommit": "70074b23d5e96a3870f7cb0abec35d8e7418593b", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}]}
