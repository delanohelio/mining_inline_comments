However, the way that StorageOptions is structured makes it difficult to pass in plugin-specific options parameter to the category. This may require some refactoring from our side.\nMeanwhile, this PR looks pretty solid otherwise. As you mentioned, the enum in question cannot be placed outside of core as it currently stands, so I think we will do a quick refactor of StorageOptions after merging in your changes.  How does that sound to you?", "author": "raphkim", "createdAt": "2020-10-12T19:02:40Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwMzQzNjM0Nw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwMzQ4MTMyNA==", "url": "https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-android/pull/886#discussion_r503481324", "bodyText": "@raphkim sounds great! <3", "author": "edgar-zigis", "createdAt": "2020-10-12T19:05:40Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwMzQzNjM0Nw=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}]}
