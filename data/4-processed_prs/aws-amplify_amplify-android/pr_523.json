Save, query, and observe changes to your data\n-from a local repository. Let DataStore synchronize your local data with\n-the Cloud. Our default implemenation syncs local data to/from an Amazon\n-DynamoDB database, via an Amazon AppSync front-end.\n-\n-### [REST APIs](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/restapi/getting-started/q/platform/android):\n-\n-Easy auth and request signing against multiple REST endpoints. Our\n-default plugin works great with Amazon API Gateway.\n-\n-### [GraphQL APIs](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/graphqlapi/getting-started/q/platform/android)\n-\n-Data modeling and simple auth against GraphQL endpoints. Our default\n-plugin targets AppSync.\n-\n-### [Analytics](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/analytics/getting-started/q/platform/android):\n-\n-Collect and report usage data for your app. Our default plugin\n-communicates with Amazon Pinpoint.\n-\n-### [Storage](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/storage/getting-started/q/platform/android):\n-\n-Store and retrieve files in the Cloud.
