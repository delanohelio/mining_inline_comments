The basic issue causing the crash is due to the following sequence of events:\n\nGoing offline closes the socket, which calls AmplifyWebSocketListener::onFailure\nonSubscriptionFailure is called for the first subscription\nThe error is passed to the buffer (buffer.onError())\nonPipelineBroken::call (the Action that the Orchestrator calls on error)\nOrchestrator::stopApiBlocking is called\nSubscriptionProcessor::stopAllSubscriptionActivity is called, which disposes of the TWO disposables in SubscriptionProcessor: the buffer, and the subscriptionObservables.\nonSubscriptionFailure is called for the second subscription\nAt this point, the buffer is already disposed, and the app crashes with: io.reactivex.exceptions.UndeliverableException: The exception could not be delivered to the consumer because it has already canceled/disposed the flow or the exception has nowhere to go to begin with\n\nThis PR solves the problem by removing the buffer entirely, and just streaming SubscriptionEvent objects from the subscriptionObservables directly to the Merger.  The SubscriptionProcessor is now only managing  one Disposable (the subscriptionObservable stream) instead of two.   The same crash doesn't occur with the subscriptionObservable stream, because there is an explicit check to see if the stream is disposed before emitting errors on it.  I don't think a similar check was possible with the buffer though, since it was a ReplaySubject, which I don't believe has a way to check if it has been disposed or not.\nThe one side effect of this change is that SubscriptionEvent are sent to the Merger as they arrive, instead of waiting for all subscriptions to be started.
