There have been some plugins in the past that have loaded jQuery with CKEDITOR.scriptLoader.load but I felt like using less jQuery nowadays is preferred. I also only see lodash used somewhat in web components.\nspread and Object.assign both seem to only make shallow copies and if there is an object will overwrite the entire object. My idea is I'd only pass through the change that would be made rather than the entire new object.
