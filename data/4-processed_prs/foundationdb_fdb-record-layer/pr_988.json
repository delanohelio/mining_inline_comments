The result of that invocation is a new object of type {@code S} that is\n+ * identical the original {@code this} except that all correlated references to {@code id} of the new object as well as\n+ * all objects {@code this} owns (i.e. other objects this object is composed of, e.g. children, etc.) now refer to a\n+ * new {@link CorrelationIdentifier} {@code id'}.\n+ *\n+ * Since translations are associative we allow to rebase many identifiers in the same {@link #rebase} invocation.\n+ *\n+ * As the planner DAG objects are immutable, a rebase operation can be expensive as objects have to be recreated\n+ * as needed.

to provide helpers related to topological sorts.\n+ *\n+ * The main purpose on this class is to provide a specific iterable that can efficiently traverse\n+ * all possible permutations of the input set that do not violate the given dependency constraints.\n+ *\n+ * The iterable {@link TopologicalOrderPermutationIterable} adheres to the following requirements:\n+ * 1. it does not violate the given constraints\n+ * 2. it produces all possible orderings under the given constraints\n+ * 3. it reacts appropriately to give circular dependency constraints between elements (i.e. no infinite loops)\n+ * 4. it iterates all orderings on the fly, i.e. it only stores state (i.e. does not (pre)create the orderings in memory).\n+ *\n+ * {@link TopologicalOrderPermutationIterable} subclasses {@link Iterable} in order to provide an additional feature\n+ * that allows for skipping. Assume we have a set\n+ * <pre>\n+ * {@code\n+ * { a, b, c, d } with constraints { b -> c, b -> d } (c depends on b, d depends on b)\n+ * }\n+ * </pre>\n+ *\n+ * Possible orderings are\n+ * <pre>\n+ * {@code\n+ * (a, b, c, d)\n+ * (a, b, d, c)\n+ * (b, a, c, d)\n+ * (b, a, d, c)\n+ * (b, c, a, d)\n+ * (b, c, d, a)\n+ * (b, d, a, c)\n+ * (b, d, c, a)\n+ * }\n+ * </pre>\n+ *\n+ * Frequently we test for a certain property or perform a particular operation given one possible ordering but it is clear\n+ * that it is not necessary to consider more such orderings that share a common prefix. In the example, it may be\n+ * beneficial to skip the rest of the {@code (b, a, ...)} orderings after the first one was returned\n+ * ({@code (b, a, c, d}). In this case we would like to instruct the iterator to skip all such orderings and continue\n+ * iteration at {@code (b, c, a, d)}. Similarly, we want to skip all orderings starting with {@code (b, ...)} once we\n+ * encountered the first such ordering. This the iterators created by the provided {@link TopologicalOrderPermutationIterable}\n+ * of type {@link TopologicalOrderPermutationIterator} provide a method {@link TopologicalOrderPermutationIterator#skip}\n+ * to allow skipping at a provided prefix.", "originalCommit": "6eb7142ab316ffbec53e375804118f722f1d2bcc", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ1Mzk2NTc5NA==", "url": "https://github.com/FoundationDB/fdb-record-layer/pull/988#discussion_r453965794", "bodyText": "Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n                 * @param ref the ref\n          \n          \n            \n                 * @param ref the reference", "author": "nschiefer", "createdAt": "2020-07-13T22:05:48Z", "path": "fdb-record-layer-core/src/main/java/com/apple/foundationdb/record/query/plan/temp/Quantifier.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -78,31 +132,76 @@ private ForEach(ExpressionRef<?

A quantifier\n+ * ({@link Quantifier} is referred to via {@link CorrelationIdentifier}. In this way there are no direct pointers\n+ * to objects which is desirable while the graph is mutated through transformations. At various points during\n+ * the planning of a query we may want to determine e.g. if a sub-graph would produce the same result as some other\n+ * sub-graph. Similarly, we may want to determine whether a sub-graph is already properly memoized or not. In general,\n+ * we need to theorize if two sub-graphs are related to each other (usually equality but also subsumption, etc.)\n+ *\n+ * All of that is rather straightforward if both sub-graphs are completely uncorrelated and therefore independent to\n+ * each other, to some other record producer, or even to some external parameter that is being passed in. In these\n+ * cases the {@code AliasMap} implemented here would effectively be trivial, i.e. the map would be\n+ * conceptually empty.\n+ *\n+ * There are cases, however, that need some care to establish the relationships mentioned before.\n+ *\n+ * Example 1:\n+ *    sub graph 1\n+ *        SELECT T.* FROM T WHERE T.x = c1\n+ *\n+ *    sub graph 2\n+ *        SELECT T.* FROM T WHERE T.x = c2\n+ *\n+ *    We wold like to establish, if these graphs are equal or not. Both of them are not complete, i.e. we wouldn't\n+ *    be able to execute them as is. If we asked if these sub graphs where equal, we certainly would need to say that\n+ *    that depends. If they, however, are embedded in some surrounding query that binds c1 and c2 respectively, we\n+ *    would be able to say if in the greater context of the surrounding query these sub query do the same thing.\n+ *\n+ *            SELECT * FROM R AS c1, (SELECT T.* FROM T WHERE T.x = c1)\n+ *\n+ *        is the same as\n+ *\n+ *            SELECT * FROM R AS c2, (SELECT T.* FROM T WHERE T.x = c2)\n+ *\n+ *    whereas\n+ *            SELECT * FROM R AS c1, (SELECT T.* FROM T WHERE T.x = c1)\n+ *\n+ *        is definitely not the same as\n+ *\n+ *            SELECT * FROM S AS c2, (SELECT T.* FROM T WHERE T.x = c2)\n+ *\n+ *    In short, a sub-graph can only be considered equal to another sub-graph if we assume an equality over their\n+ *    correlated references. In other words the sub-graphs define two functions f(x) and g(y). While we can determine\n+ *    if f and g are structurally equivalent we con only determine actual result equivalence if we assume x = y for\n+ *    the entire domain of x and y.\n+ *\n+ * Example 2:\n+ *    sub graph 1\n+ *        SELECT T.* FROM T WHERE T.x = c1 AND T.y = c2\n+ *\n+ *    sub graph 2\n+ *        SELECT T.* FROM T WHERE T.x = c2 AND T.y = c1\n+ *\n+ *    This scenario is somewhat more complicated as it offers more degrees of freedom.\n+ *\n+ *            SELECT * FROM R AS c1, S AS c2, (SELECT T.* FROM T WHERE T.x = c1 AND T.y = c2)\n+ *\n+ *        is the same as\n+ *\n+ *            SELECT * FROM R AS c2, S AS c1, (SELECT T.* FROM T WHERE T.x = c2 AND T.y = c1)\n+ *\n+ *    This observation is identical to the one in example 1. Due to the commutative nature we also would like to\n+ *    be able to realize that even this is the same:\n+ *\n+ *    SELECT * FROM R AS c1, S AS c2, (SELECT T.* FROM T WHERE T.x = c2 AND T.y = c1)\n+ *\n+ * In any case we need to keep track of what's currently considered bound and equal while we traverse the query graph.\n+ * When we descend into correlated sub-graphs during an algorithm while we e.g. determine {@link Correlated#resultEquals}\n+ * we need to have all outside references bound and mapped in some way: Should we treat c1 on the left as c2 on the right\n+ * or the other way around?

Correlated entities are said to be correlated to a quantifier {@code q} if the identifiers\n+ * returned by {@link #getCorrelatedTo()} set contain\n+ * the correlation identifier that {@code q} uses.\n+ *\n+ * Distinguishing the correlation identifier from the identity of the quantifier object simplifies modifications of the\n+ * graph, for example while applying transformations during query planning.\n+\n+ * An correlated object can be <em>rebased</em> using {@link #rebase} and a map of translations from one\n+ * correlation identifier to another, resulting in a new object of type {@code S} that is\n+ * identical to {@code this} except that all correlated references in the subtree rooted at this entity\n+ * (i.e., this object's relational children, predicates, etc.) are replaced with their corresponding identifiers\n+ * per the map.\n+ *\n+ * Since translations are associative we allow to rebase many identifiers in the same {@link #rebase} invocation.\n+ *\n+ * As the planner DAG objects are immutable, a rebase operation can be expensive as objects have to be recreated\n+ * as needed. We follow the ideas of other persistent data structures as we do not require a copy to be made.\n+ * It is perfectly acceptable to return {@code this} if {@code this} is not correlated to any identifier participating\n+ * in the translation.\n+ *\n+ * This interface defines a {@link #semanticEquals} method that also takes an equivalence map, and determines equality up\n+ * to the equivalences defined therein. Two correlated entities are equivalent even if they use different names, as long\n+ * as un-bound correlations can be aligned. For example, in:\n+ *\n+ * <pre>\n+ * {@code\n+ * SELECT *\n+ * FROM T1 a, T2 b\n+ * WHERE a.x = b.y\n+ * UNION (SELECT *\n+ *        FROM T1 c, T2 d\n+ *        WHERE c.x = d.y)\n+ * }\n+ * </pre>\n+ *\n+ * The two SELECT blocks should be considered equal even though they use different correlation names. The\n+ * {@link #semanticEquals} introduced here considers these blocks equal using a bi-map that allows for the definition\n+ * of equivalences among correlation identifiers.

Correlated entities are said to be correlated to a quantifier {@code q} if the identifiers\n+ * returned by {@link #getCorrelatedTo()} set contain\n+ * the correlation identifier that {@code q} uses.\n+ *\n+ * Distinguishing the correlation identifier from the identity of the quantifier object simplifies modifications of the\n+ * graph, for example while applying transformations during query planning.\n+\n+ * An correlated object can be <em>rebased</em> using {@link #rebase} and a map of translations from one\n+ * correlation identifier to another, resulting in a new object of type {@code S} that is\n+ * identical to {@code this} except that all correlated references in the subtree rooted at this entity\n+ * (i.e., this object's relational children, predicates, etc.) are replaced with their corresponding identifiers\n+ * per the map.\n+ *\n+ * Since translations are associative we allow to rebase many identifiers in the same {@link #rebase} invocation.\n+ *\n+ * As the planner DAG objects are immutable, a rebase operation can be expensive as objects have to be recreated\n+ * as needed. We follow the ideas of other persistent data structures as we do not require a copy to be made.\n+ * It is perfectly acceptable to return {@code this} if {@code this} is not correlated to any identifier participating\n+ * in the translation.\n+ *\n+ * This interface defines a {@link #semanticEquals} method that also takes an equivalence map, and determines equality up\n+ * to the equivalences defined therein. Two correlated entities are equivalent even if they use different names, as long\n+ * as un-bound correlations can be aligned.

The\n+ * {@link #semanticEquals} introduced here considers these blocks equal using a bi-map that allows for the definition\n+ * of equivalences among correlation identifiers. In this case\n+ *\n+ * <pre>\n+ * {@code\n+ * (SELECT * FROM T1 a, T2 b WHERE a.x = b.y).equals(SELECT * FROM T1 c, T2 d WHERE c.x = d.y, ImmutableBiMap.of())\n+ * }\n+ * </pre>\n+ *\n+ * result (through a series of other steps) in an invocation of\n+ *\n+ * <pre>\n+ * {@code\n+ * (WHERE a.x = b.y).equals(WHERE c.x = d.y, ImmutableBiMap.of(a -> b, c -> d))\n+ * }\n+ * </pre>\n+ *\n+ * which then results in a {@code true} as {@code a} is considered to be equal to {@code c} and {@code b} is considered\n+ * to be equal to {@code d}.\n+ *\n+ * @param <S> self type of this.
