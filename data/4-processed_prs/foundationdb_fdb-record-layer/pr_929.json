I think I understand why (namely, to be able to replace higher-order structures with simpler/more insightful representations), but it took me a long time to understand this.\nOne thing I'm still not sure about: why is this done by having the PlannerExpression do the rewriting, rather than having some \"rules\" that do the rewriting (in line with the design of the rule-based planner itself)? I think the answer is \"to avoid doing instanceof checking in some utility class\", but I wanted to double-check.", "author": "nschiefer", "createdAt": "2020-05-11T16:01:53Z", "path":
