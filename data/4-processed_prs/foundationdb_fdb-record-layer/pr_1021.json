I updated this to an enum.  It does have the benefit that we can later add other attributes to the error, but it does make other things a little more awkward - for example, there is no good way to represent an error code that we have never seen before.

The foundationdb project already has some automation that can generate C++ files based on these error definitions, so it seems like they should be able to generate this enum as well.\nThere's an alternative version of this change that resolves #1020 but doesn't try and fix the problem of error codes (partially to avoid having two changes in one PR and partially to avoid trying to argue on how the API should look).
