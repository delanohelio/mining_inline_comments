In the \"usual case\" (which should be when a new entry does not need to be created), this transaction won't be committed anyway, so the only loss in efficiency over using the transaction itself is some extra memory (and no extra network requests).\n\nIt would probably still be a good idea to do #853 (if we can figure out what we want to do about caching), but this is easier and gets us 99% of the benefit. That being said, there is more cognitive load needed to understand this API, which is perhaps a smell.", "committedDate": "2020-03-24T01:28:45Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5Njg1NDU2NQ==", "url": "https://github.com/FoundationDB/fdb-record-layer/pull/865#discussion_r396854565", "bodyText": "If we wanted to also set the max attempts, we could do that here", "author": "alecgrieser", "createdAt": "2020-03-24T01:31:24Z", "path": "fdb-record-layer-core/src/main/java/com/apple/foundationdb/record/provider/foundationdb/keyspace/LocatableResolver.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -113,71 +116,194 @@ public FDBDatabase getDatabase() {\n         );\n     }\n \n+    @Nonnull\n+    private <T> CompletableFuture<T> runAsyncBorrowingReadVersion(@Nonnull FDBRecordContext parentContext, @Nonnull Function<FDBRecordContext, CompletableFuture<T>> retriable) {\n+        final FDBDatabaseRunner runner = parentContext.newRunner();", "originalCommit": "58a729ad568a1d7591fd922149095578b15eb56d", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5NzQ2NTM0Ng==", "url": "https://github.com/FoundationDB/fdb-record-layer/pull/865#discussion_r397465346", "bodyText": "Perhaps these tests could be improved by yet another overload that only took the key and did the null itself.", "author": "MMcM", "createdAt": "2020-03-24T21:14:50Z", "path": "fdb-record-layer-core/src/test/java/com/apple/foundationdb/record/provider/foundationdb/keyspace/ExtendedDirectoryLayerTest.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -99,12 +99,12 @@ private static void testReadCompatible(LocatableResolver writer, LocatableResolv\n         Map<String, Long> allocations = new HashMap<>();\n         for (int i = 0; i < 50; i++) {\n             String key = \"key-\" + i;\n-            Long value = writer.resolve(null, key).join();\n+            Long value = writer.resolve((FDBStoreTimer)null, key).join();", "originalCommit": "58a729ad568a1d7591fd922149095578b15eb56d", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5ODIzMjIxMw==", "url": "https://github.com/FoundationDB/fdb-record-layer/pull/865#discussion_r398232213", "bodyText": "Yeah, though it's a little weird that the optional parameter is the first (rather than the last).", "author": "alecgrieser", "createdAt": "2020-03-25T23:29:53Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5NzQ2NTM0Ng=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5ODIzMjg0MQ==", "url": "https://github.com/FoundationDB/fdb-record-layer/pull/865#discussion_r398232841", "bodyText": "I added this as a separate commit with this PR, for size", "author": "alecgrieser", "createdAt": "2020-03-25T23:31:44Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5NzQ2NTM0Ng=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5Nzg4NDQyOA==", "url": "https://github.com/FoundationDB/fdb-record-layer/pull/865#discussion_r397884428", "bodyText": "Since the @VisibleForTesting doesn't really help when, say, your favorite IDE is autocompleting potential methods, maybe it would be a good idea to also name this method waitUntilReadyForTesting (unless we can restrict the use of methods tagged with this automatically?).", "author": "scgray", "createdAt": "2020-03-25T14:11:45Z", "path": "fdb-record-layer-core/src/main/java/com/apple/foundationdb/record/provider/foundationdb/FDBReverseDirectoryCache.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -371,6 +371,15 @@ public void rebuild(LocatableResolver scope) {\n         }\n     }\n \n+    /**\n+     * Wait for any asynchronous work started at object creation time to complete.
