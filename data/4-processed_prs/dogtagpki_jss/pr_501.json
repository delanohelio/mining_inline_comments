But the theory is this: Let's take wrap as an example. We need to take data from src and put it into dst if the handshake has finished. Otherwise if we're still handshaking we need to take whatever handshake data is made and puts it into dst.\nSo let's take the handshaking scenario:\n\nWe'll be ignoring src because PR.Write(...) will fail until the handshake is complete.\nSo UpdateHandshakeState() will write data into the write buffer.\nWe'll drain data from the read buffer and write it into dst.\n\nDuring this:\n\nthis_src_write will be 0 because PR.Write(...) returns 0 / PR_WOULD_BLOCK until handshake completes.\nWhile we're still handshaking in this step, UpdateHandshakeState() will write into the read buffer, which then goes into dst, incrementing this_dst_write.\nWhen we run out of handshake data to write, UpdateHandshakeState() will quit writing data (and return PR_WOULD_BLOCK) and this_dst_write will go to data as the write buffer will be empty.\n\n\nA similar thing applies when src is non-empty and we're not handshaking:\n\nWe'll be writing from src into the SSL PRFileDesc *. PR.Write(...) returns number of bytes written which ends up into this_src_write. As long as we're still writing data (and not getting an error / PR_WOULD_BLOCK), this'll be non-zero. It'll also continue being non-zero while there's space in the write buffer. However, this write buffer gets cleared out by the last step...\nUpdateHandshakeState() will return, a no-op because we're not handshaking.\nWhen there's src data and PR.Write() succeeds, there'll be data in the write buffer so we'll be able to put it in dst and this_dst_write will be non-zero.
