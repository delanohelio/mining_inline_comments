In the future, other callbacks could be written that\ntrigger an event (similar to the existing SSLSocket code); this isn't\nsuitable for use in an SSLEngine however.\n\nSigned-off-by: Alexander Scheel <ascheel@redhat.com>", "committedDate": "2020-01-07T18:33:27Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "5251459e33e7296a82984663a52c403b94d1b8ac", "url": "https://github.com/dogtagpki/jss/commit/5251459e33e7296a82984663a52c403b94d1b8ac", "message": "Enable attaching SSL Alert capturing listeners\n\nThis enables logging of the SSLAlerts sent and received by a SSLFDProxy\ninstance using the callbacks provided SSLFDProxy.\n\nSigned-off-by: Alexander Scheel <ascheel@redhat.com>", "committedDate": "2020-01-07T18:33:28Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "c9bb450a623fbce14cc0ab6a6fcfde0bb5344230", "url": "https://github.com/dogtagpki/jss/commit/c9bb450a623fbce14cc0ab6a6fcfde0bb5344230", "message": "Test new SSL alert logging functionality\n\nSigned-off-by: Alexander Scheel <ascheel@redhat.com>", "committedDate": "2020-01-07T18:33:28Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM2Mzg5OTMwMA==", "url": "https://github.com/dogtagpki/jss/pull/346#discussion_r363899300", "bodyText": "@edewata Is there a better option here?\nI want a data structure that let's me:\n\nTrack my position in the list\nPush new elements\nKnow when a new one has been seen\nBut also lets me access previous elements if I need to.\n\nUp until the last requirement, that's kinda looking like a stock queue (and calling .pop() and .push(...)) but...", "author": "cipherboy", "createdAt": "2020-01-07T18:58:14Z", "path": "org/mozilla/jss/nss/SSL.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -188,6 +191,24 @@ public static native int ConfigServerSessionIDCache(int maxCacheEntries,\n      */\n     public static native int AttachClientCertCallback(SSLFDProxy fd) throws Exception;\n \n+    /**\n+     * Enable recording of alerts in the SSLFDProxy object.\n+     *\n+     * See also: SSL_AlertReceivedCallback in /usr/include/nss3/ssl.h,\n+     *           SSL_AlertSentCallback in /usr/include/nss3/ssl.h\n+     */\n+    public static int EnableAlertLogging(SSLFDProxy fd) {\n+        fd.inboundAlerts = new ArrayList<SSLAlertEvent>();", "originalCommit": "c9bb450a623fbce14cc0ab6a6fcfde0bb5344230", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}]}
