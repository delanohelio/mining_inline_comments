QE expects us to send a reasonable TLS alert, though this isn't strictly required by TLS specification. Non-JDK X509TrustManagers wrap everything in a CertificateException; it isn't well documented that SunJSSE, when an X509ExtendedTrustManager is used, will actually support querying the internal exception for a status code. This was also part of the discussion I had with the JDK team. In order to send the right alert type, we need to know the correct NSS status code. JSSNativeTrustManager gets around this by using NSS's native cert checking and never entering Java. We need to support arbitrary X509TrustManagers, which raise arbitrary classes or a single class with messages.\nTake BouncyCastle for instance as an example of an existing non-JSS TrustManager: it uses the base CertificateException class with only a message parameter. There's no reliable way (except substring matching) to get a reasonable NSS exception code out of it. We'd have the same problem here potentially: how does a custom extension to JSSTrustManager know what exception to return? We check a few common ones, but there's no CertificateException subclass for say, OCSP revocation (CertificateRevokedException could apply to both CRL or OCSP). Nor is there one for an untrusted issuer.\nSo, we use messages and exceptions and hope for the best, unless you have a better plan. :)", "author": "cipherboy", "createdAt": "2020-06-24T20:17:15Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0NTA2MDE5Mg=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0NTE5NTA1MQ==", "url": "https://github.com/dogtagpki/jss/pull/579#discussion_r445195051", "bodyText": "Yeah, I didn't think there's going to be a better solution.
