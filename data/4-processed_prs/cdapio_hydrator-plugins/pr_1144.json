In this\n+approach, the small dataset is loaded into memory and broadcast to workers and loaded into \n+workers memory. Once it is in memory, a join is performed by iterating through the elements of the\n+large dataset. With this approach, data from the large dataset is NEVER shuffled. Data with the \n+same key can be joined in parallel across the cluster instead of handled only by a single worker \n+providing optimal performance. Data sets that have a small size can be used for in-memory joins. \n+Make sure the total size of broadcast across and join does not exceed **2GB.**", "originalCommit": "1d5819ba2bcecb5d608ffba4cfa13c8b0b8fd3d5", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2MTc3NzA3MQ==", "url": "https://github.com/cdapio/hydrator-plugins/pull/1144#discussion_r461777071", "bodyText": "done", "author": "MEseifan", "createdAt": "2020-07-28T18:12:41Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2MTc1NTM3OA=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "d559bbd6b9b37cec2e36a6139932da239a7a8d46", "url": "https://github.com/cdapio/hydrator-plugins/commit/d559bbd6b9b37cec2e36a6139932da239a7a8d46", "message": "(PLUGIN-303) Add distribution to Joiner Plugin", "committedDate": "2020-07-28T18:15:46Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "d559bbd6b9b37cec2e36a6139932da239a7a8d46", "url": "https://github.com/cdapio/hydrator-plugins/commit/d559bbd6b9b37cec2e36a6139932da239a7a8d46", "message": "(PLUGIN-303) Add distribution to Joiner Plugin", "committedDate": "2020-07-28T18:15:46Z", "type": "forcePushed"}]}
