FYI, I added this based on some notes from our doc so we might want to revisit that before we submit any PRs for the console.\n\"Remove: a synonym for \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cdelete\u201d in the body copy/dialog\"\nThere are also some places, particularly in the REST API, where \"remove\" is used synonymously with \"delete\". TBH I'm not sure if the distinction between \"remove\" and \"delete\" that you're making will apply to Infinispan.\nGenerally, when we say \"remove\" something it's deleted, rather than take it out of a container but it still exists. We even use \"remove\" in the definition for \"delete\" in this terminology list.\nWhat if we advise using \"permanently remove\" in places where there is a need to describe \"delete\"?", "author": "oraNod", "createdAt": "2020-11-06T10:03:35Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxODEwNzIzMg=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxODc1NDE4Nw==", "url": "https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/pull/8742#discussion_r518754187", "bodyText": "Ah, got it.
