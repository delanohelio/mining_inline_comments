The string in parentheses is the value of the\n+attribute within the `CoreAttributes` enum and how it appears in the UI/API.\n \n-- Filename (\"filename\"): The filename of the FlowFile. The filename should not contain any directory structure.\n+- Filename (`filename`): The filename of the FlowFile. The filename should not contain any directory structure.\n \n-- File Size (\"fileSize\"): The file size of the FlowFile in bytes.\n+- UUID (`uuid`): A Universally Unique Identifier assigned to this FlowFile that distinguishes the FlowFile from other FlowFiles in the system.\n \n-- UUID (\"uuid\"): A Universally Unique Identifier assigned to this FlowFile that distinguishes the FlowFile from other FlowFiles in the system.\n+- Path (`path`): The FlowFile's path indicates the relative directory to which a FlowFile belongs and does not contain the filename.\n \n-- Path (\"path\"): The FlowFile's path indicates the relative directory to which a FlowFile belongs and does not contain the filename.\n+- Absolute Path (`absolute.path`): The FlowFile's absolute path indicates the absolute directory to which a FlowFile belongs and does not contain the filename.\n \n-- Absolute Path (\"absolute.path\"): The FlowFile's absolute path indicates the absolute directory to which a FlowFile belongs and does not contain the filename.\n+- Priority (`priority`): A numeric value indicating the FlowFile priority.\n \n-- Entry Date (\"entryDate\"): The date and time at which the FlowFile entered the system (i.e., was created). The value of this attribute is a number that represents the number of milliseconds since midnight, Jan. 1, 1970 (UTC).\n+- MIME Type (`mime.type`): The MIME Type of this FlowFile.\n \n-- Lineage Start Date (\"lineageStartDate\"): Any time that a FlowFile is cloned, merged, or split, this results in a \"child\" FlowFile being created. As those children are then cloned, merged, or split, a chain of ancestors is built. This value represents the date and time at which the oldest ancestor entered the system. Another way to think about this is that this attribute represents the latency of the FlowFile through the system. The value is a number that represents the number of milliseconds since midnight, Jan. 1, 1970 (UTC).\n+- Discard Reason (`discard.reason`): Specifies the reason that a FlowFile is being discarded.\n \n-- Priority (\"priority\"): A numeric value indicating the FlowFile priority.\n+- Alternative Identifier (`alternate.identifier`): Indicates an identifier other than the FlowFile's UUID that is known to refer to this FlowFile.", "originalCommit": "b0a880d5fe298fd5c389e81a2b1080272f33b790", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4Mjc0MTQ1NQ==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4066#discussion_r382741455", "bodyText": "Everything else LGTM!", "author": "andrewmlim", "createdAt": "2020-02-21T18:38:11Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4Mjc0MTE0Ng=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "c295fc3786e7453b76d24bcab6e76a919783e115", "url": "https://github.com/apache/nifi/commit/c295fc3786e7453b76d24bcab6e76a919783e115", "message": "NIFI-7175 Made core attribute names more consistent.", "committedDate": "2020-02-21T18:40:15Z", "type": "commit"}]}
