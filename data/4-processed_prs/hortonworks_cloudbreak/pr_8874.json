If I'm not mistaken, there can be one GATEWAY hostGroup, and this is the instance on which KNOX is installed (not sure if there can be more than one such node). I could be completely wrong about this though. @cegganesh84 - I think you have a much better understanding of CORE vs GATEWAY and cardinality given the HA templates that you've worked on.\nIf GATEWAY==KNOX node and there can be only 1 gateway hostGroup, explicitly assigning numbers to this hostGroup first probably works.\nAlternately, may need to make this service aware.", "author": "sidseth", "createdAt": "2020-08-27T22:57:09Z", "path": "core/src/main/java/com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak/controller/StackCreatorService.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -370,9 +372,13 @@ private void setStackTypeAndValidateDatalake(Stack stack, Blueprint blueprint) {\n         }\n     }\n \n-    private void fillInstanceMetadata(Stack stack) {\n+    void fillInstanceMetadata(Stack stack) {\n         long privateIdNumber = 0;\n-        for (InstanceGroup instanceGroup : stack.getInstanceGroups()) {\n+        //Gateway HostGroups are sorted first to start with privateIdNumber 0.\n+        List<InstanceGroup> sortedInstanceGroups = stack.getInstanceGroups().stream()\n+                .sorted(Comparator.comparing(InstanceGroup::getInstanceGroupType)", "originalCommit": "4d5af2613ee5563206c415ca04f0f910cfb7b967", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ3ODc0MTQxMw==", "url": "https://github.com/hortonworks/cloudbreak/pull/8874#discussion_r478741413", "bodyText": "Looking some more, looks like GATEWAY is the first in the sort order, so this works as expected.
