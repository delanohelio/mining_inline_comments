Instead, there is now a 1:1 mapping between a service and a GraphQL source set. By default, files are are searched under src/main/graphql or src/commonMain/graphql but this is just a convention that can be overriden.\n\nTrying to map GraphQL source sets was confusing and created issues like https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android/issues/1981 or special cases for the test source sets where we would end up with duplicate classes in the classpath. Also the schema resolution rules were becoming super complex and hard to maintain.\n\nHaving one GraphQL service per service is a simple mapping that allows the files/schema resolution rules to be way easier than they used to be, removing the need for schemaPath vs schemaFile, CompilationUnit, ApolloVariant, ...", "committedDate": "2020-10-18T18:11:34Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "78a5207b9c46fc0942f0afe5a2c72cf202c64a70", "url": "https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android/commit/78a5207b9c46fc0942f0afe5a2c72cf202c64a70", "message": "update tests", "committedDate": "2020-10-18T18:11:34Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "c4132b05a8191bab1d30ece8bd191cabb4851b0a", "url": "https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android/commit/c4132b05a8191bab1d30ece8bd191cabb4851b0a", "message": "fix codegen test", "committedDate": "2020-10-18T18:11:34Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "74de5f9ee07775286a1d74842018b3483379b6b7", "url": "https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android/commit/74de5f9ee07775286a1d74842018b3483379b6b7", "message": "add Kdoc", "committedDate": "2020-10-18T18:11:34Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "e4608f3e615365e47736a7ff3701c7c55ff3276f", "url": "https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android/commit/e4608f3e615365e47736a7ff3701c7c55ff3276f", "message": "update test fixtures", "committedDate": "2020-10-18T18:13:41Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "e4608f3e615365e47736a7ff3701c7c55ff3276f", "url": "https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android/commit/e4608f3e615365e47736a7ff3701c7c55ff3276f", "message": "update test fixtures", "committedDate": "2020-10-18T18:13:41Z", "type": "forcePushed"}]}
