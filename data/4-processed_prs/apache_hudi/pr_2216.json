When debugging an actual incident,  where the commit metadata files have been archived, older snapshots of data files have been cleaned up by the cleaner,  having \"oldNumWrites\" metadata is of great help in identifying the instance that resulted in a smaller parquet file by inspecting the archived commit metadata (Especially when the check is turned off and wouldn't throw an exception).\nFor example, if the file were to evolve  from f1_c1.parquet to f1_c10.parquet, then without this \"oldNumWrites\" information, we have hunt down all the the older archived commits, in search of the commit that had touched the data file.\n@prashantwason  - in performDatalossCheck(), we should move this out side of the isDatalossCheckEnabled() condition, so that we will record this info, irrespective of whether the flag is enabled or not.", "author": "nbalajee", "createdAt": "2020-11-17T00:53:12Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyMDkzOTI3Ng=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyNjE0MjQzOQ==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/2216#discussion_r526142439", "bodyText": "@nbalajee If we move this outside of  isDatalossCheckEnabled() condition, then wont it always read the older parquet files each time before commit?
