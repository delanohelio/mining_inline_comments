This command creates a temp table. Users can write HiveQL queries against the table to filter the desired row.\n+ * `TimestampBasedKeyGenerator` supports for data types convertible to String. Previously `TimestampBasedKeyGenerator` only supports `Double`, `Long`, `Float` and `String` 4 data types for the partition key. Now, users can convert date type to string in `TimestampBasedKeyGenerator`.\n+ * Hudi now supports incremental pulling from defined partitions. For some use case that users only need to pull the incremental part of certain partitions, it can run faster by only load relevant parquet files.\n+ * CLI allows users to specify option to print additional commit metadata, e.g. *Total Log Blocks*, *Total Rollback Blocks*, *Total Updated Records Compacted* and so on.\n+ * With 0.5.2, hudi allows partition path to be updated with `GLOBAL_BLOOM` index.\n+ * Client allows to overwrite the payload implementation in `hoodie.properties`. Previously, once the payload class is set once in `hoodie.properties`, it cannot be changed. In some cases, if a code refactor is done and the jar updated, one may need to pass the new payload class name.\n+ * With 0.5.2, the community has supported to published the coverage to codecov.io on every build. With this feature, the community will know the change of test coverage more clearly.\n+ * A `JdbcbasedSchemaProvider` schema provider has been provided to get metadata through JDBC. For the use case that users want to synchronize data from MySQL, and at the same time, want to get the schema from the database, it's very helpful.\n+ * Simplify `HoodieBloomIndex` without the need for 2GB limit handling. Prior to spark 2.4.0, each spark partition has a limit of 2GB. In Hudi 0.5.1, after we upgraded to spark 2.4.4, we don't have the limitation anymore. Hence removing the safe parallelism constraint we had in` HoodieBloomIndex`.\n+ * Write Client restructuring has moved classes around ([HUDI-554](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-554))\n+   - `client` now has all the various client classes, that do the transaction management", "originalCommit": "08452932667ff569ab0684ad91966adab1058878", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5MDUzMDA3Mw==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1390#discussion_r390530073", "bodyText": "may be expand this a bit more?", "author": "vinothchandar", "createdAt": "2020-03-10T18:38:05Z", "path": "docs/_pages/releases.cn.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -7,6 +7,31 @@ last_modified_at: 2019-12-30T15:59:57-04:00\n language: cn\n ---\n \n+## [Release 0.5.2-incubating](https://github.com/apache/incubator-hudi/releases/tag/release-0.5.2-incubating) ([docs](/docs/0.5.2-quick-start-guide.html))\n+\n+### Download Information\n+ * Source Release : [Apache Hudi(incubating) 0.5.2-incubating Source Release](https://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/hudi/0.5.2-incubating/hudi-0.5.2-incubating.src.tgz) ([asc](https://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/hudi/0.5.1-incubating/hudi-0.5.1-incubating.src.tgz.asc), [sha512](https://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/hudi/0.5.1-incubating/hudi-0.5.1-incubating.src.tgz.sha512))\n+ * Apache Hudi (incubating) jars corresponding to this release is available [here](https://repository.apache.org/#nexus-search;quick~hudi)\n+\n+### Release Highlights\n+ * CLI supports `temp_query` and `temp_delete` to query and delete temp view.
