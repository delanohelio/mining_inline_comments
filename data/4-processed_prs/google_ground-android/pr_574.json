I guess the \"Tile > TileSet\" renaming issue isn't really a duplication then.\nOne could argue that we are in fact downloading the tile source--we're simply copying the file specified at a given URL (the tile source). We don't really know anything about individual tiles or care about them until we get down to the tile provider level, which looks at tiles specified in a tile source.\nBut I also don't want to argue semantics--if it's clearer to use \"Tiles\" or \"TileSet\" here I think that's fine--technically speaking though, if we are calling the thing specified in the geoJSON a tile source, that is what we are downloading here--that is, we aren't doing any parsing of the contents of the tile source and downloading individual tiles, we are just downloading the source file itself whole cloth. @gino-m", "author": "scolsen", "createdAt": "2020-09-01T16:19:17Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4MTI0NDU3MQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4MTMxMzcxMg==", "url": "https://github.com/google/ground-android/pull/574#discussion_r481313712", "bodyText": "Ahhh... sorry, at first glance I may have though this was actually downloading the tiles themselves.
