One drawback is that a dataset cannot be published until the DOI has been reserved. Specifically, if your installation uses Datacite, the moment it is upgraded to v5.0, all the pre-existing unpublished drafts will become \"unpublishable\", until you reserve the DOIs as described below. So it is important to do that immediately after the upgrade, by using the following APIs:\n+\n+`/api/pids/unreserved`  will report the ids of the datasets \n+`/api/pids/:persistentId/reserve` reserves the assigned DOI with Datacite (will need to be run on every id reported by the the first API). \n+(See the Native API guide for more information).\n+\n+Scripted, the whole process would look as follows (adjust as needed):\n+\n+```\n+   API_TOKEN='xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx'\n+   \n+   curl -s -H \"X-Dataverse-key:$API_TOKEN\" http://localhost:8080/api/pids/unreserved |\n+   # the API outputs JSON; note the use of jq to parse it:\n+   jq '.data.count[].pid' | tr -d '\"' | \n+   while read doi\n+   do\n+      curl -s -H \"X-Dataverse-key:$API_TOKEN\" -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/pids/:persistentId/reserve?persistentId=$doi\n+   done\n+```\n+\n+If you have a large number of unpublished drafts in the database, reserving them one by one may take some time. So if you want to be extra nice to your users, you may warn them ahead of time that some may have trouble publishing their drafts immediately after the upgrade. \n+\n+Going forward, once all the DOIs have been reserved for the legacy drafts, some newly-created datasets may still end up with unreserved DOIs.

But it does help to ensure that the DOI is guaranteed to be available beforehand. New APIs have been provided for finding any unreserved Datacite-issued DOIs in your Dataverse, and for reserving them (see below). If you are upgrading an installation that uses Datacite, we specifically recommend that you reserve the DOIs for all your pre-existing unpublished drafts as soon as Dataverse v5.0 is deployed, since none of them were registered at create time. \n+\n+The following API calls should be used:\n+`/api/pids/unreserved`  will report the ids of the datasets \n+`/api/pids/:persistentId/reserve` reserves the assigned DOI with Datacite (will need to be run on every id reported by the the first API). \n+(See the Native API guide for more information).\n+\n+Scripted, the whole process would look as follows (adjust as needed):\n+\n+```\n+   API_TOKEN='xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx'\n+   \n+   curl -s -H \"X-Dataverse-key:$API_TOKEN\" http://localhost:8080/api/pids/unreserved |\n+   # the API outputs JSON; note the use of jq to parse it:\n+   jq '.data.count[].pid' | tr -d '\"' | \n+   while read doi\n+   do\n+      curl -s -H \"X-Dataverse-key:$API_TOKEN\" -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/pids/:persistentId/reserve?persistentId=$doi\n+   done\n+``` \n+\n+Going forward, once all the DOIs have been reserved for the legacy drafts, you may still get an occasional dataset with an unreserved identfier. Datacite service instability would be a potential cause. There is no reason to expect that to happen often, but it is not impossible. You may consider running the script above (perhaps with some extra diagnostics added) regularly, from a cron job or otherwise, to address this preemptively.
