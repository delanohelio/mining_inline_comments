Upgrading from an earlier version of Payara should be a straightforward process: Undeploy Dataverse; stop Payara; move the current Payara directory out of the way; unzip the new Payara version in its place; replace **the brand new `payara/glassfish/domains/domain1` with your old, preserved `domain1`**; start Payara, deploy Dataverse 5.2. We still recommend that you read the detailed upgrade instructions above; and, if you run into any issues with this upgrade, it will help to be able to separate them from any problems with the upgrade of Dataverse proper. \n+If you are still using pre-5.0 version of Dataverse, and Glassfish version 4, please follow the upgrade instructions in the Dataverse 5.0 release notes; but use the latest version of Payara 5 (5.200.7, as of this writing).
