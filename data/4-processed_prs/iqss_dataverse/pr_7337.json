The problem is the next lines though - the second Replace button that would trigger the warning dialog to not replace a file that's already being replaced in the draft version was showing and it shouldn't have. For now, I've just adjusted the logic there (only show the dialog if there is a draft replacement for the file, which is not true for the replacing file.)\nThe logic is simpler too. FWIW, I went back about 4 years in github to see if I could find out why the current terms were in there and didn't find a clear reason, so perhaps someone else might have a better sense and be able to see if there's anything my change misses?\nHowever, I'm also not sure that dialog is needed anymore - a file that has been replaced in the latest version now shows a dialog when you click the 'Edit' button itself, so you never get to the individual menu items like replace and delete and therefore can't trigger the dialogs related to them. If it's true that there is no way to get to those items for a file that has been replaced/deleted in the current version, they (those replace and delete items and the dialogs they trigger) should probably be deleted (new issue?).", "author": "qqmyers", "createdAt": "2020-10-28T13:40:58Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxMzAxNjc2MQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "72475d3db290df2b3b0be673f3b8581324a70639", "url": "https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/commit/72475d3db290df2b3b0be673f3b8581324a70639", "message": "fix duplicate replace button", "committedDate": "2020-10-28T13:26:57Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxMzc0ODI4OA==", "url": "https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/pull/7337#discussion_r513748288", "bodyText": "Getting a null pointer here when I try to delete a file via the EditDataFilesPage from the Dataset Page.
