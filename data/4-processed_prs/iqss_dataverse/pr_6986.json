Thus moving these potentially\n+long-running jobs completely outside the Application Server (Payara);\n+and preventing worker threads from becoming locked serving them. Since\n+zipping is also a CPU-intensive task, it is possible to have this\n+service running on a different host system, freeing the cycles on the\n+main Application Server.
