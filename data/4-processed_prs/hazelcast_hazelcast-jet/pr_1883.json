Therefore the process went to `fillInbox`\nand found a WM there. So the state proceeded to PROCESS_WATERMARK, but the\noutbox was still blocked.\n\n- `tryProcessWatermark` tried to emit the `currentTraverser` first, but\ncouldn't because the outbox was blocked. And there it remained stuck, trying\nthat forever.\n\nReturning `true` from `tryProcess()` or returning an empty inbox and having an\nunfinished item in the outbox is allowed. So we changed the contract of\n`snapshotCommitFinish` that it must not add items to outbox and if there's a\nphase-2, we just execute that method and return to where we left.\n\nFixes #1881", "committedDate": "2020-01-24T08:30:41Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "56a2d81e12eca53b03b89c15de26f33fa7961a28", "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/commit/56a2d81e12eca53b03b89c15de26f33fa7961a28", "message": "Merge branch 'master' into blocked-outbox-fix", "committedDate": "2020-01-27T12:53:21Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "5025f40202bdc48a5bd9dcdc05d01df44ef80605", "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/commit/5025f40202bdc48a5bd9dcdc05d01df44ef80605", "message": "Fix grammar", "committedDate": "2020-01-27T13:07:13Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3MjMyMDgyOA==", "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/1883#discussion_r372320828", "bodyText": "is the double underscore intentional here? looks a little strange", "author": "cangencer", "createdAt": "2020-01-29T11:09:00Z", "path": "hazelcast-jet-core/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/jet/impl/execution/ProcessorState.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -73,23 +73,32 @@\n \n     /**\n      * Making calls to {@link Processor#snapshotCommitFinish(boolean)} until it\n-     * returns {@code true}.\n+     * returns {@code true} and then return to {@link #PROCESS_INBOX}.
