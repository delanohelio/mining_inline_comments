In May 2020 we did an\n+extensive test with various combinations of old and new JDK/GC\n+combinations and we bring you the most important conclusions that should\n+impact your Hazelcast Jet setup:\n+\n+1. As far as Hazelcast Jet is concerned, JDK version 8 is an antiquated\n+   runtime and shouldn't be used. None of its garbage collectors have\n+   satisfactory performance and their long GC pauses even result in\n+   nodes being kicked out of the cluster.\n+2. JDK 11 is the current Long-Term Support (LTS) version by Oracle and\n+   it is the lowest version of JDK we recommend. We found that its\n+   version of the G1, without any fine-tuning, already delivers\n+   next-generation GC performance. The default maximum GC pause target\n+   is 200 ms, which it meets in a very broad range of scenarios. By\n+   configuring a single JVM option (`-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis`), you can\n+   confine the maximum GC pause to 20-25 ms, which it can maintain at\n+   lower GC pressure levels.\n+4. There are two more GCs that are relevant, but as of this writing are\n+   in the experimental phase. They are the low-latency collectors:\n+   Oracle's Z and OpenJDK's Shenandoah. Testing on JDK 14, we found Z to\n+   be the better of the two and a viable replacement for G1 in scenarios\n+   that have low GC pressure, but very strict GC pause requirements. Z\n+   was able to keep the maximum pause within 10 milliseconds. Since the\n+   Z is available in OpenJDK as well, we recommend it for scenarios\n+   where G1's GC pauses are too long. The version of Z in JDK 14 has\n+   crude ergonomics to decide on a good background GC thread count, in\n+   some cases you can improve the throughput by using\n+   `-XX:ConcGCThreads`.\n+\n+Here are some more details, organized by the type of workload you are\n+using Jet for.\n+\n+## Moderate State, Low-Latency Stream Processing", "originalCommit": "92121960695006f2a9cbcd3a7d3e3231d5a4395c", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzNjAxNzE4Ng==", "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet/pull/2272#discussion_r436017186", "bodyText": "I think the example below, 100,000 devices, quantifies it.

The 500Hz is irrelevant, it doesn't increase the state size. So if I assume 5-second lag and 5-second window and 32 bytes per entry, the formula is 100,000 * 1000/15 * 10 * 32, so the state is 2GB, which is moderate. But if you use 1-minute smoothing window, the state is 13GB. And both answers are correct, because the window size isn't given.
