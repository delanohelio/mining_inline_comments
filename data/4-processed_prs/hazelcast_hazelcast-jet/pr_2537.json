Snapshotting is a process with 9 stages. I'm interested to see what happens in all the stages, on connection drop. If I would make the test more deterministic (for example the way you suggest), then it would probably always trigger around the same stage, towards the end or after snapshotting. I don't want that. With such a random sleep there will eventually always be runs for all possible scenarios. Yes, it's not deterministic, will be hard to debug, but if there is a problem we will likely find out about it. Eventually.
