So it's not that much pain.\n@mtopolnik It's not a lambda, but a method we call. We can check if the declaringClass of close method is the Processor class:\nif (p.getClass().getMethod(\"close\").getDeclaringClass() == Processor.class)\n    // ignore the close method\nI benchmarked this too. This check took 1.3\u03bcs, while directly executing a no-op runnable took 1.7\u03bcs.
