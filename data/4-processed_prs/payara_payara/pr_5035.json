You could imagine having a build of an deplyoable artefact which builts a jar and a war of the same name. According the current code it would only be possible to deploy the jar. As this comes first in the list. The same goes for the qualifier by which you have a built which produces two jars of the same name but one has i.e. the qualifier UBER to mark the uber-jar containing all the dependencies inside. You couldn't distinguish them without using a qualifier.\nYou could default those two GAV components to jar and empty and would not have to iterate over the list of file suffixes.
