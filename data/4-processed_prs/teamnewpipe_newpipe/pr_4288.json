Without it Android will resize the thumbnail on every notification update which is a heavy task if the image is large (on YouTube it's large). In this case I made it smaller (much smaller) and if Android needs to resize it the time needed for the resize will be small. I'm not sure about the quality of the thumbnail but for me it looks ok compared to previous thumbnail impelementation. You can then change the width from 200dp (player_notification_thumbnail_width) to something else if the quality is not as good as you want.\nThe main thing that eats main thread's CPU time is an image resize but after this change there is no such problem. Actually I didn't tested in profiler after the change but visually it doesn't lock main thread as before on rotation change and after other changes.", "author": "avently", "createdAt": "2020-09-27T14:55:40Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5NTU3NTgzNw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5NTU4MjA2NA==", "url": "https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/4288#discussion_r495582064", "bodyText": "With media style notifications the thumbnail can be even smaller because it use less space than previous notifications.", "author": "avently", "createdAt": "2020-09-27T15:05:23Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5NTU3NTgzNw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5NTU4MzA0Ng==", "url": "https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/4288#discussion_r495583046", "bodyText": "Would be better to somehow get the size for thumbnail inside media style notification and apply this size instead of 200dp.
