These are in the format x.xx.x . In order to get this new version, you can:\n- 1. Build a debug APK yourself. This is the fastest way to get new features on your device, but is much more complicated, so we recommend using one of the other methods.\n- 2. Add our custom repo to F-Droid and install it from there as soon as we publish a release. The instructions are here: https://newpipe.net/FAQ/tutorials/install-add-fdroid-repo/\n- 3. Download the APK from [Github Releases](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/releases) and install it as soon as we publish a release.\n- 4. Update via F-droid. This is the slowest method of getting updates, as F-Droid must recognize changes, build the APK itself, sign it, then push the update to users.\n+<!-- Hidden span to keep old links compatible. -->\n+<span id=\"updates\"></span>\n+\n+## Installation", "originalCommit": "815dd0f70661b60ce3396a4466854ef977078ec3", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU1ODUzNzc3Ng==", "url": "https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/5108#discussion_r558537776", "bodyText": "Done.", "author": "mhmdanas", "createdAt": "2021-01-15T19:20:54Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU1ODQ2MjE0Mw=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "a7ff73dbfd4b3c1010a19165cb8a5601d9e868c1", "url": "https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/commit/a7ff73dbfd4b3c1010a19165cb8a5601d9e868c1", "message": "Rename installation to installation and updates", "committedDate": "2021-01-15T19:18:49Z", "type": "commit"}]}
