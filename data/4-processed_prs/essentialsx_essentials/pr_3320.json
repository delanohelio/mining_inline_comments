I think you're right about that. It is definitely going to fire every time a plugin loads. I actually did originally have these in onEnable, but the problem is that before checkPermissions is run (which is only done here) the handler in PermissionsHandler is null. It's probably done in this fashion to avoid adding softdepends on every Vault-based permission plugin.\nTwo possible solutions:\n\nFrom the event, check if the plugin is a known one that supports contexts.\nSchedule a task to register contexts on the first server tick.\n\nI don't particularly like either solution, but it doesn't seem like Bukkit has any event that gets called after all plugins are loaded.
