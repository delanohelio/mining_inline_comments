If a resource is assigned a scope, then the token accessing the resource should be generated\u00a0with that scope. By associating a scope with a role, you can control which users are permitted to have tokens under certain scopes. In this instance, associating a role to a scope seems legitimate.\n \n Validating the role of a requester does not make much sense in some scenarios. For instance, when the scope is used as a means of generating an access token and not for securing a resource (e.g. openId scope).\u00a0In such situations, scope validation can be extended to skip role validation for certain scopes.\n \n ### Skipping role validation for scopes\n \n-When scopes which cannot be associated to roles are requested, the token should be issued without validating the scope.
