Therefore, WSO2 API Manager has a bot detection mechanism in place to prevent such attacks by identifying who tried to enter and invoke resources without proper authorization. WSO2 API Manager's bot detection mechanism traces and logs details of such unauthorized API calls and sends notifications in this regard via emails. Thereby this helps Publishers to protect their data from bot attackers and improve the security of their data.  \n+There is a possibility that hackers may invoke services without any proper authentication by using tools such as port scanning.
