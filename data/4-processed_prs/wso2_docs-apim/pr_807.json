Each request represents \n+an event, and the information captured includes the API name, the country and city from which the request was \n+generated,and the timestamp to which the information applies. Each node stores this information in the \n+APIM_ANALYTICS_DB data store defined in the `<API-M_ANALYTICS_HOME>/conf/worker/deployment.yaml` file.\n+\n+Now let's assume that during a specific hour, the API-M Gateway node publishes 30,000 events in node 1, and 40,000 \n+events in node 2 for Naples in Italy. When you retrieve the total for this hour via a retrieval query, the result is 70000.\n+\n+## Configuring an active-active cluster\n+   \n+To configure the API-M Analytics nodes to deploy them as an active-active cluster, edit the `<API-M_ANALYTICS_HOME>/conf/worker/deployment.yaml` file as follows:\n+\n+!!! note\n+\n+    Before you begin:\n+    \n+        - Download two binary packs of WSO2 API-M Analytics.\n+        - Set up a working RDBMS instance to be used by the WSO2 API-M Analytics cluster.\n+        \n+1. For each node, enter a unique ID for the id property under the wso2.carbon section. This is used to identify each \n+node within a cluster. For example, you can add IDs as shown below.\n+    - For node 1:\n+    ``` yaml\n+    wso2.carbon:\n+      id: wso2-am-analytics-1\n+    ```\n+    - For node 2:\n+    ``` yaml\n+    wso2.carbon:\n+      id: wso2-am-analytics-2\n+    ```\n+    \n+2. Enable partitioning aggregations for each node, and assign a unique shard ID for each node. To do this, set the \n+partitionById and shardId parameters as Siddhi properties as shown below.\n+\n+    !!! note \n+        \n+        Assigning shard IDs to nodes allows the system to identify each unique node when assigning parts of the \n+        aggregation. If the shard IDs are not assigned, system uses the unique node IDs (defined in step 1) for this purpose.\n+        \n+    - For node 1:\n+        ``` yaml\n+        siddhi:\n+          properties:\n+            partitionById: true\n+            shardId: wso2-sp-analytics-1\n+        ```\n+    - For node 2:\n+    ``` yaml\n+    siddhi:\n+      properties:\n+        partitionById: true\n+        shardId: wso2-sp-analytics-2\n+    ```\n+    \n+    !!! note \n+    \n+        - To maintain data consistency, do not change the shard IDs after the first configuration\n+        - When you enable the aggregation partitioning feature, a new column ID named SHARD_ID is introduced to the \n+        aggregation tables. Therefore, you need to do one of the following options after enabling this feature to \n+        avoid errors occuring due to the differences in the table schema.\n+            - Delete all the aggregation tables for SECONDS, MINUTES, HOURS, DAYS, MONTHS, YEARS. \n+            - Edit the aggregation tables by adding a new column named SHARD_ID, and specify it as a primary key.\n+\n+3. Configure a database, and then update the default configuration for the APIM_ANALYTICS_DB data source with \n+parameter values suitable for your requirements in `<APIM_ANALYTICS_HOME>/conf/worker/deployment.yaml`\n+\n+   ``` yaml\n+    \n+   - name: APIM_ANALYTICS_DB\n+         description: \"The datasource used for APIM statistics aggregated data.\"\n+         jndiConfig:\n+           name: jdbc/APIM_ANALYTICS_DB\n+         definition:\n+           type: RDBMS\n+           configuration:\n+             jdbcUrl: \"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/APIM_ANALYTICS_DB_1?useSSL=false\"\n+             password: pass\n+             username: root\n+             driverClassName: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver\n+             maxPoolSize: 50\n+             idleTimeout: 60000\n+             connectionTestQuery: SELECT 1\n+             validationTimeout: 30000\n+             isAutoCommit: false\n+         \n+   ```  \n+   \n+   - If you are configure analytics for WSO2 Micro Gateway, import the \n+   appropriate DB script from `<APIM_ANALYTICS_HOME>/wso2/worker/dbscripts/apimgt/`\n+\n+!!! note \n+\n+    As explained in above the events are processed in multiple active nodes. Eventhough this is usually a stateful \n+    operation, you can overcome the node-dependent calculations via distributed aggregation. This allows WSO2 API-M to \n+    execute APIM Analytics scripts that depend on incremental distributed aggregation.\n+    \n+    However, an active-active deployment can affect alerts because alerts also depend on some in-memory stateful \n+    operations such as windows. Due to this, alerts can be generated based on the events received by specific node. Thus \n+    the alerts are node-dependent, and you need to disable them to run scripts with distributed incremental aggregation.", "originalCommit": "78c939ac2d8f2027cbac83b04f7bbc981e40da2c", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5MDc2OTMxMw==", "url": "https://github.com/wso2/docs-apim/pull/807#discussion_r390769313", "bodyText": "fixed", "author": "ruks", "createdAt": "2020-03-11T06:36:53Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4ODgyMDI4Nw=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "2b250fd24afd5184b1d72413e64ad48be1ada467", "url": "https://github.com/wso2/docs-apim/commit/2b250fd24afd5184b1d72413e64ad48be1ada467", "message": "Fixed review comments", "committedDate": "2020-03-11T06:31:50Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "aa20e5b016b0f161a6d300845fe50d171e5b5472", "url": "https://github.com/wso2/docs-apim/commit/aa20e5b016b0f161a6d300845fe50d171e5b5472", "message": "Resolved conflicts", "committedDate": "2020-03-11T06:43:02Z", "type": "commit"}]}
