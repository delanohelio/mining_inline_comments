If the authorization server issues a refresh token, it is included when returning an access token.\u00a0Refresh tokens are issued for all other grant types other than the **implicit grant** as recommended by the OAuth 2.0 specification.\n+After an access token is generated, sometimes you might have to renew the old token due to expiration or security concerns. You can renew an access token using a refresh token, by issuing a REST call to the Token API with the following parameters.\n+A refresh token has to be obtained before using it with a grant type such as the authorization code or password grant type. Using the obtained refresh token, you can obtain a new access token along with a renewed refresh token without having to go through any other additional steps.\n \n-!!! tip\n-    Be sure to keep the refresh token private, similar to the access token as this token issues access tokens without user interactions.\n+The diagram below illustrates the refresh token grant flow.\n \n+![]({{base_path}}/assets/img/Learn/oauth-refresh-token-diagram.png)", "originalCommit": "6396a044d505a684d91b884cba4dd0629fc26db4", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5ODYwMDA3Ng==", "url": "https://github.com/wso2/docs-apim/pull/924#discussion_r398600076", "bodyText": "path should not start with ../", "author": "Mariangela", "createdAt": "2020-03-26T14:07:40Z", "path": "en/docs/learn/api-security/oauth2/grant-types/refresh-token-grant.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -141,6 +152,6 @@ curl -k -v -d \"token=4ed29669-a457-3f83-af1e-180cad271cca&token_type_hint=refres\n ```\n \n !!! note\n-    Note that for users to be counted in the [Registered Users for Application statistics](../../../../../analytics/analyzing-apim-statistics-with-batch-analytics/viewing-api-statistics/#ViewingAPIStatistics-TopUsersperApplication) which takes the number of users shared each of the Application, they should have to generate access tokens using [Password Grant](../password-grant/) type.\n+    Note that for users to be counted in the [Registered Users for Application statistics]({{base_path}}/learn/analytics/analyzing-apim-statistics-with-batch-analytics/viewing-api-statistics/#ViewingAPIStatistics-TopUsersperApplication) which takes the number of users shared each of the Application, they should have to generate access tokens using [Password Grant](../password-grant/) type.", "originalCommit": "6396a044d505a684d91b884cba4dd0629fc26db4", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5OTA0NjE4Mg==", "url": "https://github.com/wso2/docs-apim/pull/924#discussion_r399046182", "bodyText": "fixed with 2f49d3c", "author": "Meruja", "createdAt": "2020-03-27T05:42:02Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5ODYwMDA3Ng=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "4f7756b030e0320d6aa94efb9d94b2511565156d", "url": "https://github.com/wso2/docs-apim/commit/4f7756b030e0320d6aa94efb9d94b2511565156d", "message": "Fixed internal links and added diagrams.", "committedDate": "2020-03-27T04:46:52Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "2f49d3ce30667a54361e6e272e29e9caaab37db1", "url": "https://github.com/wso2/docs-apim/commit/2f49d3ce30667a54361e6e272e29e9caaab37db1", "message": "Fixed review comments.", "committedDate": "2020-03-27T05:20:22Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "2f49d3ce30667a54361e6e272e29e9caaab37db1", "url": "https://github.com/wso2/docs-apim/commit/2f49d3ce30667a54361e6e272e29e9caaab37db1", "message": "Fixed review comments.", "committedDate": "2020-03-27T05:20:22Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"oid": "72855c5f8d78d6bb9d38a5da53ff72e65d3f6ea6", "url": "https://github.com/wso2/docs-apim/commit/72855c5f8d78d6bb9d38a5da53ff72e65d3f6ea6", "message": "Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/master'", "committedDate": "2020-03-27T05:58:33Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5OTA3MTY3NA==", "url": "https://github.com/wso2/docs-apim/pull/924#discussion_r399071674", "bodyText": "We can use two tabs to display the format and the example.", "author": "tgtshanika", "createdAt": "2020-03-27T07:11:15Z", "path": "en/docs/learn/api-security/oauth2/grant-types/implicit-grant.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -61,11 +61,23 @@ The following parameters are required to implement the Implicit\u00a0grant type in W\n </tbody>\n </table>\n \n-An example is given below :\n-\n-``` java\n-    https://localhost:8243/authorize?scope=openid&response_type=id_token&redirect_uri=http://localhost:8080/playground2/oauth2client&nonce=13e2312637dg136e1&client_id=mzdQQ0RZOIqAf549ucIImB4h0SIa\n-```\n+!!!
