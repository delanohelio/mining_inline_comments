However, from WSO2 API-M 1.9.0 onwards, you can [plug different OAuth2 providers](https://docs.wso2.com/display/AM260/Configuring+a+Third-Party+Key+Manager) to the key validation. When you call an API providing an access token, the execution flows through the handlers specified in the API. Among them, the API authentication handler extracts the token from the header and calls `APIKeyValidationService` to get the token validated. Upon validating the token, the API Gateway receives `APIKeyValidationInforDTO` as the response, using which the rest of the operations are performed.\n+Previously, in WSO2 API Manager (WSO2 API-M) the Key Manager was loosely coupled with other components and the users could [plug in different OAuth2 providers](https://docs.wso2.com/display/AM260/Configuring+a+Third-Party+Key+Manager) for the purpose of key validation. However, now, the Key Manager call that was used in the key validation process at runtime has been removed altogether and the default token type has been set to JWT (JSON Web Token). Now, the JWT Token validation takes place at the Gateway itself and the subsequent subscription validation also takes place in the Gateway as the required meta-information is available in the Gateway memory.
