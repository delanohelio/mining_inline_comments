This particular feature will address the first part of the sample scenario, which is the requirement for the business APIs to be accessed by different parties via different devices, where different SDKs can address the needs of the different types of consumers involved.\n \n ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8oHiX6n-3JUVLVfGMuRe0A0LIaSvyzBoyoanKYkRD1tqvuY0PPw71bYJhhiqi9KVfH-79x4Rh56BoyZw_cDebrfcXdhOT9_oONzLtybaFBWST3bkFICh_uChJosVVV7F1HBwrkvFyJH74SIaZg)\n+\n The API consumers can create different clients using a preferred programming language. For an example, let\u2019s consider two parties that need an application that consumes the APIs using Python and Java. They can develop two applications using the SDK\u2019s for Python and Java separately. The SDK, which is automatically generated through WSO2 API Manager, will handle the API invocation logic; while, the application developer only needs to focus on the business logic of the client and call the method with the respective parameters in the SDK.\n \n-##### Same API accessed by different clients\n+### Same API accessed by different clients\n \n In WSO2 API Manager, clients can create separate applications for the same API and in turn use these different applications to access the API. In this example, different users can get the interest rates for bank loans and fixed deposits by subscribing to the applications, which provide the relevant APIs, that the bank has exposed to the public.\n \n Furthermore, the client may be accessing this information via WSO2 API Manager using a mobile device. Therefore, in order to cater to the latter mentioned requirement ABC bank can develop the client application using the Android SDK, and similarly in order to create a client application using Java, they can use the Java SDK by calling the respective SDK methods.\n \n ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/vg1W-nIII1cMKvfzT7Yiy_xphKI2cgq4KCmCKecFSAr4UQ3KmyldyitsgKaN5500q9vu2K2nAWC4VpeimibHAe9rYfzR7n9hDSUckhtJNVKMXPBzdi-JrOsTxcnSir4Gnky9T9XBogpYomMHwQ)\n-##### API developer optimizing the API output by identifying the client\n \n-API developers can use the headers sent by the client to detect the type of the client (e.g., if the client is a mobile device or not). For example, consider a client who is accessing ABC bank's API\u2019s and performing online account balance checking. In the latter mentioned scenario, if the API developer needs to allow\u00a0mobile device clients to only access\u00a0a selected set of data of their account details, and expose all the data to desktop application clients, this can be achieved when using WSO2 API Manager by having a custom sequence in the API definition.\u00a0For more information on adding custom sequences, see [Adding Mediation Extensions](https://docs.wso2.com/display/AM260/Adding+Mediation+Extensions) .\n+### API developer optimizing the API output by identifying the client\n+\n+API developers can use the headers sent by the client to detect the type of the client (e.g., if the client is a mobile device or not).
