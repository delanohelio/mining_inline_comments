Create a role named `custom_role` with `API Create`, `API Publish` and `API Subscribe` permissions (along with `Login` permission) and assign it to a user.\n-\n-    !!! tip\n-        Refer [Managing Users and Roles]({{base_path}}/administer/product-administration/managing-users-and-roles/introduction-to-user-management/) to learn how to create a user role with permissions and assign it to a user.\n-\n-2.  Assigning the required scopes for the `custom_role` can be done using 2 methods.\n-\n-    1.  Using API-M management console.\n-\n-        1. Sign in to the API-M management console (`https://<APIM_Host>:<APIM_Port>/carbon`) as a tenant admin user.\n-\n-        2. Navigate to **Main > Resources > Browse** \n-\n-        3.  Enter `/_system/config/apimgt/applicationdata/tenant-conf.json` as the location and click **Go** to browse the registry and locate the required resource.\n-\n-        4.  Update the `RESTAPIScopes` JSON field by adding `custom_role` to the `Roles` field under the corresponding scope `Name` fields as shown below.\n-            ```bash\n-            {\n-                \"Name\": \"apim:api_publish\",\n-                \"Roles\": \"admin,Internal/publisher,custom_role\"\n-            },\n-            {\n-                \"Name\": \"apim:api_view\",\n-                \"Roles\": \"admin,Internal/publisher,Internal/creator,Internal/analytics,custom_role\"\n-            },\n-            {\n-                \"Name\": \"apim:api_delete\",\n-                \"Roles\": \"admin,Internal/creator,custom_role\"\n-            },\n-            {\n-                \"Name\": \"apim:subscribe\",\n-                \"Roles\": \"admin,Internal/subscriber,custom_role\"\n-            },\n-            {\n-                \"Name\": \"apim:app_owner_change\",\n-                \"Roles\": \"admin,custom_role\"\n-            },\n-                \"Name\": \"apim:app_import_export\",\n-                \"Roles\": \"admin,custom_role\"\n-            },\n-            {\n-                \"Name\": \"apim:api_import_export\",\n-                \"Roles\": \"admin,custom_role\"\n-            },\n-            },\n-                \"Name\": \"apim:app_manage\",\n-                \"Roles\": \"admin,Internal/subscriber,custom_role\"\n-            },\n-            {\n-                \"Name\": \"apim:api_product_import_export\",\n-                \"Roles\": \"admin,custom_role\"\n-            },\n-            ``` \n-\n-    2.  Using API-M management console.\n-        \n-        1. Log in to the Admin portal (`https://<APIM_Host>:<APIM_Port>/admin`).\n-\n-        2. Navigate to **Settings > Scope Mapping** in Admin portal.\n-\n-        3.  Add `custom_role` to the `Roles` field under the corresponding scope `Name` fields as shown below.\n-\n-            [![Admin portal scope mapping]({{base_path}}/assets/img/learn/api-controller/admin-portal-scope-mapping.png)]({{base_path}}/assets/img/learn/api-controller/admin-portal-scope-mapping.png)\n-\n-            The above screenshot only shows adding the `custom_role` to the scopes `apim:api_publish`, `api_view` and `apim:subscribe`. But similarly, you should add `custom_role` to the scopes `apim:app_owner_change`, `apim:app_import_export`, `apim:api_import_export`, `apim:app_manage` and `apim:api_product_import_export` as well.\n+## Minimal Permissions and Scopes Required to Perform API Controller Operations\n \n-3.  Restart the server or wait for 15 mins until the registry cache expires.\n+Further, you can create your own custom user with a custom role to perform specific set of API Controller operations. Refer the below table to learn about the required permissions and scopes that are needed for each of the API Controller operation.\n \n-## Minimal Permissions and Scopes Required to Perform API Controller Operations\n+!!! info\n+    **Steps to create a custom user with a custom role for your need** \n \n-As explained in the above section, you can create any user with a custom role to perform operations using the API Controller. But if you want that user to perform some of the API Controller operations (not all) you can refer the below table and assign the permissions/scopes accordingly for that role.\n+    - As shown in [Create user roles]({{base_path}}/administer/managing-users-and-roles/managing-user-roles/#create-user-roles) section, you can create your own custom user role by assigning permissions and scopes that are required to perform a particular set of API Controller operations by reffering the table below.", "originalCommit": "57cbdefa382cefd41c06235caa95f45ef9538bc6", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU3MTUzOTY5NQ==", "url": "https://github.com/wso2/docs-apim/pull/1442#discussion_r571539695", "bodyText": "Fixed via 74cdaa1", "author": "wasuradananjith", "createdAt": "2021-02-07T04:57:38Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU2NjU1ODgwNA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU3MTU0MDQyMA==", "url": "https://github.com/wso2/docs-apim/pull/1442#discussion_r571540420", "bodyText": "Fixed via edd8ae4 for 3.2.0", "author": "wasuradananjith", "createdAt": "2021-02-07T05:06:46Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU2NjU1ODgwNA=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}]}
