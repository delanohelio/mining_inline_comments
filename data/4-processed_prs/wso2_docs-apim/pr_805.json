This service \n+is OAuth2 protected and if you want to use this feature in your developer portal, APIM team will provide access to \n+the recommendations API. Once the recommendations feature is activated, recommendation feature related events will be \n+published to this recommendations API. When a user logs in to the developer portal, recommended APIs based on that \n+portal will be sent from the service and that APIs will be listed.\n+\n+## To API Publishers\n+If you want your API to be discovered by a larger audience, try to be descriptive when adding details of the API. \n+Recommendation features analyze the API name, API description, context, resource path, resource descriptions, resource \n+summary, tags and suggest the API in the developer portal. Meaningful descriptions with correct terminology will be \n+picked first and recommended to the user.\n+\n+## To API Subscribers\n+Recommendation feature will analyze the Application name, Application details when recommending APIs. Adding a \n+detailed description about your application, it\u2019s capabilities and the use case will be matched with the APIs that \n+are currently available in the Developer portal. Also the feature will analyze the APIs that the user has previously \n+viewed and the clicked tags when recommending an API. \n+\n+### How to enable the feature\n+\n+Add the following configurations to the `<API-M_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` file and restart the server.\n+\n+```\n+[apim.devportal.recommendations]\n+recommendations_api = \"<Recommendations service provided by WSO2>\"\n+consumer_key = \"<Provided by the WSO2 APIM team>\"\n+consumer_secret = \"<Provided by the WSO2 APIM team>\"\n+```\n+\n+### Additional configurations\n+Only add the following configurations if you need to change the default behaviour.\n+```\n+max_recommendations = 10\n+wait_duration = 10\n+apply_for_all_tenants = false\n+```\n+\n+- **max_recommendations**: Max recommendations displayed in the developer portal.

If that interval\n+ needs to be changed, add the time in minutes.\n+- **apply_for_all_tenants**: In a multi tenant deployment, if recommendations feature is enabled, it will show\n+ recommendations in all the developer portals and if you need to apply the recommendation feature only for selected \n+ tenants, add false here. \n+\n+### Enable recommendations feature for a specific tenant", "originalCommit": "b9735ced33d640bd64507cc7e995fa6ef929fb02", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4ODc2Mjg0Ng==", "url": "https://github.com/wso2/docs-apim/pull/805#discussion_r388762846", "bodyText": "Fixed", "author": "1akshitha", "createdAt": "2020-03-06T08:12:33Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4ODcyNjc4NA=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4ODcyNzM4MA==", "url": "https://github.com/wso2/docs-apim/pull/805#discussion_r388727380", "bodyText": "Recommendation service is available as a SaaS service for all wso2 customers and secured via oauth2.
