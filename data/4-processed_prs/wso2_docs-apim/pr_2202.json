Thus admin role which has all the admin-related permissions cannot be assigned to a user who needs admin portal access.\n+\n+In these situations, we need to create a new role permission mapping for a created role and assign it to a user and access the admin portal by that user. Follow the instructions below to configure this:\n+\n+\n+### Step-1- Create a user role\n+\n+1. Sign in to the management console (`https://<APIM_Host>:<APIM_Port>/carbon`) as the admin (default credentials are `admin`/`admin`).\n+\n+2.  Click **Main**, and then click **Add** under **Users and Roles**.\n+    \n+    ![Add users and roles]({{base_path}}/assets/img/administer/add-users-and-roles.png)\n+\n+3.  Click **Add New Role**.\n+\n+    ![Add new role]({{base_path}}/assets/img/administer/add-new-role.png)\n+\n+4. Enter the name of the user role which we are going to assign admin portal access (e.g : `adminPortalManager`) and click **Next**\n+\n+    ![Add admin portal role]({{base_path}}/assets/img/administer/add-admin-portal-role.png)\n+\n+5.  The permissions page opens. click **Finish** without selecting any permissions.\n+\n+Now a new user role `adminPortalManager` has been created without any associated permissions.\n+\n+### Step-2- Create role permissions\n+\n+1. Sign in to Admin Portal (`https://<APIM_Host>:<APIM_Port>/admin`) using `admin`/`admin` and navigate to Settings > Role Permissions in the Admin Portal. \n+\n+2. Click **Add role permission**.\n+\n+    ![Add Role Permission]({{base_path}}/assets/img/administer/add-role-permission.png) \n+\n+3. Provide the  role name which is created in step-1. Then click **Next** to proceed.\n+\n+    ![Add Role Mapping]({{base_path}}/assets/img/administer/add-new-role-mapping.png)\n+    \n+4. In **Select permissions** select **Custom Permissions** and  navigate to  **Permissions** --> **admin**. \n+Assign the scopes listed in the table below according to the role of the user.\n+\n+    !!! note\n+            You need to assign `apim:api_workflow_view`, `apim:api_workflow_approve`, `apim:admin_settings`, `apim:tenantInfo` to any user to login and access a minimum version of admin portal.\n+             ![Minimum Version of Admin Portal]({{base_path}}/assets/img/administer/minimum-version-admin-portal.png)\n+             \n+            A user with these scopes will get access to manage workflow tasks.  To perform other functions, relevant scopes need to be assigned on top of these 4 scopes. For example, if you want to restrict an Admin Portal user to manage **deny policies** then assign `apim:bl_view` and `apim:bl_manage` scopes with the above scopes mentioned.\n+    ", "originalCommit": "1255666a5ab352c7d1f34e2a868b0815f73fc0e7", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxODU1MTY3MQ==", "url": "https://github.com/wso2/docs-apim/pull/2202#discussion_r518551671", "bodyText": "As per our offline discussion removed that section. 6c27a35", "author": "Sarangan0219", "createdAt": "2020-11-06T06:43:45Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxODUzNDgyMg=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "6c27a35cdc97d1d6a70baf61a1f5a4d3c38d12bd", "url": "https://github.com/wso2/docs-apim/commit/6c27a35cdc97d1d6a70baf61a1f5a4d3c38d12bd", "message": "remove scopes section", "committedDate": "2020-11-06T06:42:39Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "1ff8a89fc747a91510c67b9979565b28364adf6f", "url": "https://github.com/wso2/docs-apim/commit/1ff8a89fc747a91510c67b9979565b28364adf6f", "message": "Refined the doc", "committedDate": "2020-11-27T11:20:10Z", "type": "commit"}]}
