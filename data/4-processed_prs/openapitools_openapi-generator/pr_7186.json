One could add this test in a couple locations:\n\nthe v3 sample tests, how about adding a test of the component schema _special_.model._name which is named SpecialModelName in python OR\n\none would need to add a new fake_api endpoint (here's an example) which sends or receives this model to verify that the import is set correctly in fake_api\n\n\nthe java testing file for this generator, add a new test with an oddly named component and check its import in an operation (endpoint) that uses that schema", "author": "spacether", "createdAt": "2020-08-11T16:52:39Z", "path": "modules/openapi-generator/src/main/java/org/openapitools/codegen/languages/PythonClientExperimentalCodegen.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -330,7 +330,7 @@ public String toDefaultValue(Schema p) {\n     @Override\n     public String toModelImport(String name) {\n         // name looks like Cat\n-        return \"from \" + modelPackage() + \".\" + toModelFilename(name) + \" import \"+ name;\n+        return \"from \" + modelPackage() + \".\" + toModelFilename(name) + \" import \"+ toModelName(name);", "originalCommit": "be889f0fe3e00c55631b157e3fa058218decda1f", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "b5f8f5c300c2172cc619ce54f46c981e299ec0d2", "url": "https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/commit/b5f8f5c300c2172cc619ce54f46c981e299ec0d2", "message": "Add unit test", "committedDate": "2020-08-11T20:30:15Z", "type": "commit"}]}
