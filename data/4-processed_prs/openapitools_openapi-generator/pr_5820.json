I was wondering why that was not the case. I suspect this is because in ModelUtils, the functions typically don't have access to anything other than the local schema passed as an argument, which makes it harder to access elements like the container schema (which would be needed to get the name of the container schema)\nHere the use of x-one-of-name  is just a workaround.", "author": "sebastien-rosset", "createdAt": "2020-04-07T13:26:44Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwMzM5MzY2NA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQxNDY5MTk0Mw==", "url": "https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/pull/5820#discussion_r414691943", "bodyText": "Without x-one-of-name, the generated oneOf name for the schema below would be OneOf<Animal,Plant,Fungus,Bacteria>\n\nI think it's because the default toOneOfName is used: https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/blob/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/main/java/org/openapitools/codegen/DefaultCodegen.java\nI'll do some tests to try to figure out the \"correct\" way to override this method in the language generator so that we don't need to use x-one-of-name if possible.", "author": "wing328", "createdAt": "2020-04-24T16:06:52Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwMzM5MzY2NA=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "7ab11394ded07aab1b19c24c8eedf6d453edfdc9", "url": "https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/commit/7ab11394ded07aab1b19c24c8eedf6d453edfdc9", "message": "sync from master", "committedDate": "2020-04-07T13:35:32Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "4f550a97b99c1cf64a203513d054c217279817f6", "url": "https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/commit/4f550a97b99c1cf64a203513d054c217279817f6", "message": "Merge branch 'master' of github.com:CiscoM31/openapi-generator into x-one-of-name", "committedDate": "2020-04-08T13:28:51Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "32d2a0975134eb4fb16f6917079aa99c98af94d0", "url": "https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/commit/32d2a0975134eb4fb16f6917079aa99c98af94d0", "message": "Merge branch 'master' of github.com:CiscoM31/openapi-generator into x-one-of-name", "committedDate": "2020-04-10T18:49:23Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "f8cd33340cf53ace1839db8e4d9d9a08e04274ea", "url": "https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/commit/f8cd33340cf53ace1839db8e4d9d9a08e04274ea", "message": "Merge branch 'master' of github.com:CiscoM31/openapi-generator into x-one-of-name", "committedDate": "2020-04-10T18:50:12Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "c9893e57f94df8c6809f72ce8ffb12a0d2c3a86c", "url": "https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/commit/c9893e57f94df8c6809f72ce8ffb12a0d2c3a86c", "message": "Merge branch 'master' of github.com:CiscoM31/openapi-generator into x-one-of-name", "committedDate": "2020-04-23T05:37:35Z", "type": "commit"}]}
