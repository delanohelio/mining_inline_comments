Well you added a new operation to the topology, which incremented the counter used to generate the names of every processor, state store, and internal topic downstream of the new operator.\n+\n+This renaming means the streams application `count()` processor now uses a new state store, vs. the one created when you first started the application.  The situation is the same if you used an in-memory store as the name of the changelog topic has changed as well, so there is nothing to restore once streams builds the in-memory store.\n+\n+Your orginal data is still there, but it's just that streams isn't using the previously created state store and changelog topic.", "originalCommit": "aa3a073ce44d5be84a8125d2a1c16cb12da6dd77", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwNTc5MjIyNg==", "url": "https://github.com/confluentinc/kafka-tutorials/pull/314#discussion_r405792226", "bodyText": "Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n            Now let's start over but this time you'll update the topology and provide names to all stateful operators:\n          \n          \n            \n            Now let's start over.
