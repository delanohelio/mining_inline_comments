Perhaps #1067 will fix this? So this rule shouldn't be necessary and compile errors would give devs a warning earlier than checkstyle errors. I don't really mind having this as an extra safety net though.", "author": "massdosage", "createdAt": "2020-05-29T11:34:48Z", "path": ".baseline/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml", "diffHunk": "@@ -165,6 +165,11 @@\n             <property name=\"illegalClasses\" value=\"com.google.common.base.Optional, com.google.common.base.Supplier\"/>\n             <message key=\"import.illegal\" value=\"Use the Java8 version of Guava objects.\"/>\n         </module>\n+        <module name=\"IllegalImport\">\n+            <property name=\"id\" value=\"BanUnrelocatedGuavaClasses\"/>", "originalCommit": "fcf5c705cb0cf90f4400cef59288b6ca73c79a72", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}]}
