Instead, I think we should start with the LICENSE and NOTICE files from iceberg-hive-runtime that @massdosage just added. That includes most of the same content, but removed Arrow and its transitive dependencies, like Netty buffer (I think).", "author": "rdblue", "createdAt": "2020-09-13T23:40:59Z", "path": "flink-runtime/LICENSE", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,516 @@\n+\n+                                 Apache License\n+                           Version 2.0, January 2004\n+                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n+\n+   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n+\n+   1.
