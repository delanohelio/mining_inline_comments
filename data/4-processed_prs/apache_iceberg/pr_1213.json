This is especially likely to happen when users did not keyBy or otherwise pre-shuffle the data according to the partition key.\nIs pre-shuffling something that the users should be doing before writing to the table (either keyBy or ORDER BY in Flink SQL)? I understand that this is specifically a PartitionedFanoutWriter, and so it makes sense that keys might not always come together (and even in the case where users did keyBy the partition key, if the number of TaskManager slots that are writing does not equal the cardinality of the partition key you'll still wind up with multiple RollingFileAppenders in a single Flink writing task and thus fanout). However, for long running streaming queries, it's possible that this TaskManager doesn't see this partition key again for days or even weeks (especially at a high enough volume to emit a complete file of the given target file size).\nI guess my concern is that users wind up with a very high cardinality of keys on a single TaskManager. Either because they didn't pre-shuffle their data or perhaps they have an imbalance between the cardinality on the partition key and the parallelism at the write stage such that records might not naturally group together enough to emit an entire file. Or,  as another edge case, one partition key value is simply not common enough to emit an entire file from this PartitionedFanoutWriter.\nIIUC, if the PartitionedFanoutWriter does not see this partition key enough times in this TaskManager again to emit a full file for quite some time, a file containing this data won't be written until close is called. For very long running streaming jobs, this could be days or even weeks in my experience. This could also lead to small files upon close. Is this a concern that Iceberg should take into consideration or is this left to the users in their Flink query to determine when tuning their queries?\nI imagine with S3, data locality of a file written much later than its timestamp of when the data was received is not a major concern, as the manifest file will tell whatever query engine reads this table which keys in their S3 bucket to grab and the locality issue is relatively abstracted away from the user, but what about if the user is using HDFS? Could this lead to performance issues (or even correctness issues) on read if records with relatively similar timestamps at their RollingFileAppender are scattered across a potentially large number of files?\nI suppose this amounts to three concerns (and forgive me if these are non-issues as I am still new to the project, but not new to Flink so partially this is for helping me understand, as well as reviewing my concerns when reading this code):\n\nShould we be concerned that a writer won't emit a file until a streaming query is closed due to the previously mentioned case? Possibly tracking the time that each writer has existed and then emitting a file if it has been far too long (however that could be determined).\nIf a record comes in at some time, and then the file containing that record isn't written for a much greater period of time (on the order of days or weeks), could this lead to correctness problems or very large performance problems when any query engine reads this table?\nWould it be beneficial to at least emit a warning or info level log to the user that it might be beneficial to pre-partition their data according to the partition key spec if perhaps the number of unique RollingFileAppender writers gets too high for one given Flink writer slot / TaskManager? Admittedly, it might be difficult to determine a heuristic of when this might be a problem vs just the natural difference in the parallelism of writing task slots vs the cardinality of the partition key.", "author": "kbendick", "createdAt": "2020-07-26T21:46:39Z", "path": "core/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/io/PartitionedFanoutWriter.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,73 @@\n+/*\n+ * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\n+ * or more contributor license agreements.

Then you can either fail if you go over that limit, or can close and release files with a LRU policy. Failing brings the problem to the user's attention immediately and is similar to what we do on the Spark side, which doesn't allow writing new data to a partition after it is finished. That ensures that data is either clustered for the write, or the job fails.\nThe long-term plan for Spark is to be able to influence the logical plan that is writing to a table.

Opening the file in the constructor and relying on it always being there avoids a null check in write, which is called in a tight loop. The main benefit of this is to avoid a delete in close when no records were written, but that check is still present in RollingFileWriter. And I think that check should be there because it is another helpful invariant: if a 0-record file is produced by any writer wrapped by RollingFileWriter, then it should be discarded. That helps avoid the problem in future implementations, which may not consider the case.\nThis is fairly minor, but since there are other changes needed (in particular, the array fix for task commit messages), I'd like to change at least the Spark writers back to eagerly creating output files instead of lazily checking for null in write.", "author": "rdblue", "createdAt": "2020-07-31T01:03:12Z",
