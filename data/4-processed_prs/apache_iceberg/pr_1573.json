I haven't looked at the underlying reader to confirm so it may be a moot point.\nGenerally, in our other performance work we've tried to move away from InputStream entirely. For example, we expose this as the only input mechanism for streams.\nThen higher levels consumers should be preallocating space based on say, page size, do a bulk pull from the underlying system (say s3) and then do all byte reads using unsafe byte reads or similar (as opposed to an inputstream stack). In those cases, (hopefully) you can use the appropriate intrinsic operations.\nFor reference, the impl for S3 of the above are in these two classes: Using AWS Sync Client, Useing AWS Async Client\nFeel free to grab anything that seems useful. Unfortunately, we don't actually use the latter true async implementation because we've found the AWS Java SDk2 async api for S3 to be very buggy (or at least it was when were last testing it).

We use similar optimizations when reading / writing directly to S3 from plain old java programs.\nThis might somewhat go against the grain of how FileIO works, but if there were a filesystem concept like exists in some of the python code, we could make use of the multipart file upload manager and then upload based on the configured block size, which makes reads from S3 (when reading along the same block size) significantly more performant. It also means that all file uploads have a final commit operation (such that they all succeed or don't). I guess with Iceberg that final commit operation isn't really necessary though, as it's ok for tables to have files in them that don't belong as they will be filtered out by the metadata.\nBut I'm still hugely in favor of making multipart uploads work for us.
