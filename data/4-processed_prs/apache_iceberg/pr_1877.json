You're probably familiar with the rationale for using spark. We also didn't see the need for partitioned in the property since it only makes sense for partitioned writes. We could think of it as a global option that only has a behavior change when the table is partitioned.\nWhat do you think about using write.spark.fanout.enabled instead of write.spark.partition.fanout.enabled?", "author": "rdblue", "createdAt": "2020-12-05T01:20:20Z", "path": "site/docs/configuration.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -156,5 +156,5 @@ df.write\n | target-file-size-bytes | As per table property      | Overrides this table's write.target-file-size-bytes          |\n | check-nullability      | true                       | Sets the nullable check on fields                            |\n | snapshot-property._custom-key_    | null            | Adds an entry with custom-key and corresponding value in the snapshot summary  |\n-| partitioned.fanout.enabled       | false        | Overrides this table's write.partitioned.fanout.enabled  |\n+| fanout-enabled       | false        | Overrides this table's write.spark.partitioned.fanout.enabled  |", "originalCommit": "779e9186241fbb37d02f081a3cf463764fcc3925", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUzNjQ4NDkzOA==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1877#discussion_r536484938", "bodyText": "@rdblue, I had a chat with @aokolnychyi earlier today and  I got to know the rationale behind adding spark.\nI will rename it to write.spark.fanout.enabled", "author": "karuppayya", "createdAt": "2020-12-05T02:26:45Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUzNjQ3MjI4Ng=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUzNjQ3MjQzNA==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1877#discussion_r536472434", "bodyText": "Thanks, I like adding a class for these.", "author": "rdblue", "createdAt": "2020-12-05T01:20:52Z", "path": "spark/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/spark/SparkWriteOptions.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,32 @@\n+/*\n+ * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\n+ * or more contributor license agreements.
