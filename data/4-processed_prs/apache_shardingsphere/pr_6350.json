Good job!\nBesides, here are some of my questions, waiting for your feedback.\n\nInsertSelectSegment and SelectSegment looks similar, do you think it is possible to remain either of them?\nThe existing class of SubquerySegment and new SelectSegment are alike somehow. Could you give them a look again?\nAre there any consequent PRs needed to complete this feature later?", "author": "tristaZero", "createdAt": "2020-07-15T05:58:24Z", "path": "shardingsphere-sql-parser/shardingsphere-sql-parser-statement/src/main/java/org/apache/shardingsphere/sql/parser/sql/segment/dml/assignment/InsertSelectSegment.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,36 @@\n+/*\n+ * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more\n+ * contributor license agreements.
