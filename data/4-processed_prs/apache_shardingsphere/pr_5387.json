Business parties need to perform JDBC programming for Encrypt-JDBC. Since Encrypt-JDBC implements all JDBC standard interfaces, business codes can be used without additional modification. At this time, Encrypt-JDBC is responsible for all interactions between the business code and the database. Business only needs to provide encryption rules. ** As a bridge between the business code and the underlying database, Encrypt-JDBC can intercept user behavior and interact with the database after transforming the user behavior. **", "originalCommit": "887444092053a140b40b0a74be61833d45834aa8", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "23853473bbfa9d45181a1d81a6897cffb6139201", "url": "https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/commit/23853473bbfa9d45181a1d81a6897cffb6139201", "message": "fix the issue as suggestion", "committedDate": "2020-04-30T16:30:51Z", "type": "commit"}]}
