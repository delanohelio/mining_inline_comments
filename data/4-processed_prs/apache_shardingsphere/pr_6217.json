And also supports multiple type of task such as time-driven,data-driven,long-term and temporary task.Main features are as follows:\n \n-Since ElasticJob has been open sourced at the end of 2014, it has been more than 5 years. With its rich features, comprehensive documentation, high-quality code and ease of use of the framework, it has accumulated a large number of loyal users and a good industry reputation (5.8K star). It has been one of the most popular projects in the field of distributed scheduling framework.\n+ * Task aggregation\n+ * Dynamic resource scheduling\n+ * Fault detection and automatic repairing\n+ * Failover and retry\n+ * Full-featured operation platform and management tools\n+ * Friendly with cloud-native\n \n-In the past two years, ElasticJob has slowed down its development due to core developers' efforts to develop and maintain the Apache ShardingSphere project. However, with the continuous expansion of the Apache ShardingSphere project in the distributed field and the user demands for functions such as distributed management of multiple data cluster environments and elastic expansion of data migration, a powerful distributed scheduling component is required. As a result, the Apache ShardingSphere community has planned to initiate a proposal to use ElasticJob as its subproject for continuous update and maintenance.\n+ ElasticJob can fully meet enterprise user's requirements on scheduling and processing ability for task management and batch jobs.\n \n-We made this good news public for the first time and we will bring more information about ElasticJob in the future.\n+<!-- ElasticJob\u81ea2014\u5e74\u5e95\u5f00\u6e90\u4ee5\u6765\uff0c\u7ecf\u5386\u4e865\u5e74\u591a\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4ee5\u5176\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u6027\uff0c\u6587\u6863\u7684\u5168\u9762\u6027\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6613\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u79ef\u7d2f\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u548c\u826f\u597d\u7684\u4e1a\u5185\u53e3\u7891\uff085.8K star\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u76f4\u4e5f\u662f\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8c03\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\u9886\u57df\u6700\u53d7\u5927\u5bb6\u6b22\u8fce\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002 -->\n+ElasticJob began to open it's source code at end of 2014.
