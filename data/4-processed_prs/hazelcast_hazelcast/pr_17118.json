In this case, we should either avoid them altogether or make them through a master branch to minimize engineering time spent on conflict resolution.\nBut as I mentioned before, not passing NodeEngine to classes when possible was a conscious decision - we do not like such objects to leak without a strong reason, because it promotes bad class design in the longer perspective.

In this case, we may just move the method that calculates partition map to a separate utility method and invoke it from Jet.
