{"pr_number": 17895, "pr_title": "External Smart Client Public Address Discovery", "pr_createdAt": "2020-11-25T07:47:27Z", "pr_url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/17895", "timeline": [{"oid": "697ba7689b3b9a3bdfc74d81825cd165329342b8", "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/commit/697ba7689b3b9a3bdfc74d81825cd165329342b8", "message": "External Smart Client Public Address Discovery\n\nThis PR makes discovery by external smart client way simpler and more secure in the cloud environments. From now on, all that the client needs to know is an address of any member (or a load balancer if members are exposed via load balancer).\n\n* Related [PRD](https://hazelcast.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PM/pages/2280227357/External+Smart+Client+discovery+via+LoadBalancer)\n* Related [TDD](https://hazelcast.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PM/pages/2689663054/External+Smart+Client+discovery+via+LoadBalancer+TDD)\n\n---------\n\nExample of how it works on **Kubernetes** (GKE)\n\n1. Create 3 members, each exposed by a separate NodePort (or LoadBalancer) service.\n```\nkubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-kubernetes/master/rbac.yaml\nfor i in {1..3}; do \\\n  NAME=hazelcast-${i}; \\\n  kubectl create service nodeport $NAME --tcp=5701; \\\n  kubectl run $NAME --image=leszko/hazelcast:external-client --port=5701 -l \"app=${NAME},role=hazelcast\"; \\\ndone\n```\n\n2. Connect the smart client to any of the `IP:PORT` or members and the smart client just works.\n\n3. You can also expose all members via one LoadBalancer service\n```\nkubectl create service loadbalancer hazelcast --tcp=5701 -o yaml --dry-run=client | kubectl set selector --local -f - \"role=hazelcast\" -o yaml | kubectl create -f -\n```\n\n4. Check the external IP\n```\n$ kubectl get svc/hazelcast\nNAME        TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)          AGE\nhazelcast   LoadBalancer   10.127.245.180   35.223.84.167   5701:31368/TCP   8m57s\n```\n\n5. Connect from the Java Client\n```\nClientConfig config = new ClientConfig();\nconfig.getNetworkConfig().addAddress(\"35.223.84.167:5701\");\nHazelcastInstance instance = HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient(config);\n```\n\n--------\n\nExample of how it works on **AWS**\n\n1. Start 3 Hazelcast on 3 EC2 Instances\n2. Assuming EC2 Instances have public IPs, connect to any public IP and smart client works correctly.\n\nThe same works for any cloud environment (Azure, GCP).\n\n**Note:** client does not need to know any AWS/Azure/GCP credentials!\n\n---------\n\nSome considerations during the review process:\n1. I implemented auto-enabling of this feature, please check [TDD](https://hazelcast.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PM/pages/2689663054/External+Smart+Client+discovery+via+LoadBalancer+TDD) for more details\n2. The implementation is backward and forward compatible, no changes in the client protocol are needed", "committedDate": "2020-12-01T11:18:56Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "67d4b187e6f8a3ffc9b375938ad2cefaffad0f39", "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/commit/67d4b187e6f8a3ffc9b375938ad2cefaffad0f39", "message": "test fixes", "committedDate": "2020-12-01T11:18:56Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "0214a3958f2b77f6602b7d5d4fd526e5142aa852", "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/commit/0214a3958f2b77f6602b7d5d4fd526e5142aa852", "message": "test fixes", "committedDate": "2020-12-01T11:18:56Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "0214a3958f2b77f6602b7d5d4fd526e5142aa852", "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/commit/0214a3958f2b77f6602b7d5d4fd526e5142aa852", "message": "test fixes", "committedDate": "2020-12-01T11:18:56Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUzMjcxODcyNA==", "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/17895#discussion_r532718724", "bodyText": "minor: I guess changing this has no real effect, but does it make sense to change 4.1 XSD in 4.2 dev branch?", "author": "vbekiaris", "createdAt": "2020-11-30T16:16:23Z", "path": "hazelcast-spring/src/main/resources/hazelcast-spring-4.1.xsd", "diffHunk": "@@ -4593,7 +4593,7 @@\n             </xs:element>\n             <xs:element name=\"socket-options\" type=\"endpoint-socket-options\" minOccurs=\"0\"/>\n         </xs:all>\n-        <xs:attribute name=\"name\" type=\"xs:string\" use=\"optional\" default=\"\"/>\n+        <xs:attribute name=\"name\" type=\"xs:string\" use=\"optional\"/>", "originalCommit": "e0f5f9e252d8ee7f5fec3203a6882b130743cd5e", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUzNDAyMDk2Mw==", "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/17895#discussion_r534020963", "bodyText": "The purpose was to change the one that was released next but I got confused because the failing test was using an XML(\"advancedNetworkConfig-applicationContext-hazelcast.xml\") which points to 4.1 xsd.
