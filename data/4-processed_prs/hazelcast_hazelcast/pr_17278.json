In many applications, the set of queries is fixed. Therefore, the result of \n+query optimization could be cached and reused. This document explains the design of the plan cache in the Hazelcast Mustang SQL\n+engine.\n+\n+In section 1 we discuss the high-level requirements to the plan cache. In section 2 we describe the design. \n+\n+## 1. Requirements\n+\n+We assume that the result of query optimization is deterministic. That is, the same query plan is produced for the same set of \n+inputs. The inputs of the query optimizer are:\n+1. Catalog (schemas, tables, indexes)\n+1. The original query: query string, current schema, and parameters \n+1. Metadata\n+\n+### 1.1 Catalog\n+\n+A  catalog is a set of objects that may participate in query execution. The catalog is often referred to as \"schema\" in \n+the literature. We use the term \"catalog\" to disambiguate from the logical object containers, which are also called \"schemas\".\n+ \n+The catalog has three types of objects. *Schema* is a logical container for other objects. *Table* is a relation backed\n+by some physical storage, such as an `IMap`. *Index* is an additional data structure of a table that speeds up the execution \n+of queries. The catalog is used to resolve objects mentioned in the query and choose the proper access method. \n+\n+If the catalog is changed, the plan created earlier might become invalid. For example, if the table is dropped, the execution \n+of the plan will produce an error. If a new index is added, the optimizer may pick a better access path.\n+\n+The plan cache must be able to find and remove plans that have become invalid after changing the catalog. \n+\n+### 1.2 Query\n+\n+The query consists of the query string, the current schema, and parameters. Each of them may influence the optimization result.\n+\n+The current schema affects object resolution. For example, the query `SELECT * FROM map` may refer to `IMap` or `ReplicatedMap`\n+depending on the current schema (`partitioned` or `replicated`). \n+\n+Parameter values may alter statistics derivation and access path selection. For example, `SELECT ... FROM sales WHERE region=?`\n+may have different optimal plans for regions `EMEA` and `APAC`.  \n+ \n+The plan cache must use query content properly to ensure the correctness and efficiency of the query execution.  \n+ \n+### 1.3 Metadata\n+ \n+In the query optimization theory, metadata is external information that is used for optimization. Examples are \n+statistics, column uniqueness, data distribution, etc.\n+\n+In this document, we consider only partition distribution because this is the only metadata we use in our optimizer, \n+that is not part of the catalog, and that could change across query runs.\n+\n+Every plan is built for the specific partition distribution. That is, the distribution and participating members are saved \n+in the plan.\n+\n+The plan cache must be able to find and remove plans with obsolete partition distribution. \n+ \n+## 2.

Design\n+\n+### 2.1 Plan Key\n+\n+The plan key is a key used to locate the cache plan. It should be possible to derive the key from the query before the \n+optimization phase. \n+\n+We use the following key:\n+```\n+PlanKey {\n+    List<List<String>> searchPaths;\n+    String sql;\n+}\n+```\n+`searchPaths` is the list of schemas that are used to resolve non-fully qualified objects during query parsing.

If the map size is greater than the maximum size, some plans are \n+evicted. \n+\n+Eviction is synchronous because the asynchronous variant is prone to out-of-memory. We assume that for the most workloads \n+evictions should be rare. \n+\n+We use the LRU (least recently used) approach to find the plans to evict. Whenever a plan is accessed, it's `lastUsed` field is \n+updated with the current time. During the eviction, plans are sorted by their `lastUsed` values, and the least recently used\n+plans are removed.   \n+\n+### 2.4 Reacting to Catalog and Partition Distribution Changes\n+\n+If a catalog or partition distribution is changed, some plans must be invalidated. There are two different ways to achieve \n+this: `push` and `pull`.\n+\n+With the `push` approach, the plan cache is notified about a change, from the relevant component. E.g., if an index is created,\n+then the map service notifies the plan cache about the change. The advantage of this solution is that any change is reflected \n+in the plan cache immediately. However, this approach increases coupling, because many components (map service, \n+replicated map service, partition service) now have to be aware of the SQL subsystem. This approach also requires complex\n+synchronization between query optimizer, plan cache, and dependent components, to ensure that no stale plan is ever cached.\n+\n+With the `pull` approach, the SQL subsystem queries other components periodically, collects the changes, and invalidates \n+affected plans. The advantage of this approach is simplicity. No synchronization or changes to other components are needed. \n+Invalid plans are guaranteed to be removed eventually. The downside is that invalid plans might be active for some time after\n+the change has occurred.\n+\n+We choose the `pull` approach due to simplicity and sufficient guarantees. The background worker reconstructs the catalog \n+periodically, and verifies that existing plans are compatible with the current catalog and partition distribution. \n+\n+To counter the problem with outdated plans, we add a special `invalidatePlan` flag to `QueryException`. If an invalid plan\n+is used, an exception with this flag will be thrown at some point. When the initiator member receives an exception with \n+this flag, the plan is invalidated. \n+\n+Note that currently, users will have to re-execute the query in this case. In future versions, we will add a transparent\n+query retry, so that invalid plans will not be visible to users.    \n+\n+### 2.5 No Use of Parameters\n+\n+In other databases, parameters are used for plan caching, because the same queries with different parameters may have different \n+optimal plans.\n+\n+We do not use parameters at the moment, because we do not have statistics. We may change this decision in the future when \n+statistics are available.", "originalCommit": "27f2595a576b35d2084c05b1c96f0a55db2dc468", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2NjMyOTI2MQ==", "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/17278#discussion_r466329261", "bodyText": "Parameter types are fixed in the plan.

This is really surprising to me. The consequence is that implicit conversion rules of SQL do not apply as in my example above: if you have a VARCHAR field and compare it to NUMBER parameter, the number parameter gets converted to VARCHAR and not the other way as would be the case if the number was a literal.\nThen I tried SELECT ? FROM map and got Illegal use of dynamic parameter - obviously. Also SELECT a FROM t WHERE f=? + ? throws Cannot apply '+' to arguments of type '<UNKNOWN> + <UNKNOWN>.\nIf this is the behavior of expressions, then this PR is correct, we don't need to store parameter types in plan cache key. But I think this behavior is not correct. Checked with PostgreSQL, parameter type is taken into account. You also can do SELECT ?. I don't have other DB at hand locally, but this fiddle with oracle suggests that oracle also takes the type of dynamic parameter into account: queries in PL/SQL blocks are converted to ones with parameters.\nAlso it is not as JDBC is designed. In JDBC you set the parameters in a typed way, using PreparedStatement.setInt(), setString() etc. I checked a few JDBC implementations, all but HSQLDB store the type used to set the parameter. Mysql even replaces the parameter with a literal.\ncc: @taburet", "author": "viliam-durina", "createdAt": "2020-08-06T17:36:12Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2NTY4MzQ2MA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2NjY0Nzg1NQ==", "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/17278#discussion_r466647855", "bodyText": "Parameters are not used in planning for a reason - there will be too many different plans otherwise. We would like to avoid this complexity unless there is an obvious reason to go into it. There is no correct or wrong way of handling parameters wrt the ANSI standard. We are free to choose the way we find it convenient.\nIsolated usage of parameters (e.g. SELECT ? ..., or ? + ?) will work in future releases, there is an issue for this. Things like SELECT varchar + ? attempts to use the existing context to derive the result, the correct semantics is yet to be understood during beta, but, for example, assuming that the parameter is DECIMAL would be reasonable for the most cases. And the main thing - if the user is not satisfied with the result, he can always use CAST operator.\nRegarding JDBC - this is not really the case. This is not the user who defines parameter types. Parameter types are defined by the database before the actual values are provided. The database gives users information about expected parameter types through PreparedStatement.getParameterMetadata before they are actually set, and users use this information to invoke the proper setters.\nNevertheless, this doesn't mean that the JDBC result set metadata doesn't depend on actual parameters. For example, some databases (e.g. Postgres) may decide to use a special UNKNOWN type for parameter placeholder for the statement SELECT ?, and the result set metadata will be different for different parameter values.

In many applications, the set of queries is fixed. Therefore, the result of \n+query optimization could be cached and reused. This document explains the design of the plan cache in the Hazelcast Mustang SQL\n+engine.\n+\n+In section 1 we discuss the high-level requirements to the plan cache. In section 2 we describe the design. \n+\n+## 1. Requirements\n+\n+We assume that the result of query optimization is deterministic. That is, the same query plan is produced for the same set of \n+inputs. The inputs of the query optimizer are:\n+1. Catalog (schemas, tables, indexes)\n+1. The original query: query string, current schema, and parameters \n+1. Metadata\n+\n+### 1.1 Catalog\n+\n+A  catalog is a set of objects that may participate in query execution. The catalog is often referred to as \"schema\" in \n+the literature. We use the term \"catalog\" to disambiguate from the logical object containers, which are also called \"schemas\".\n+ \n+The catalog has three types of objects. *Schema* is a logical container for other objects. *Table* is a relation backed\n+by some physical storage, such as an `IMap`. *Index* is an additional data structure of a table that speeds up the execution \n+of queries. The catalog is used to resolve objects mentioned in the query and choose the proper access method. \n+\n+If the catalog is changed, the plan created earlier might become invalid. For example, if the table is dropped, the execution \n+of the plan will produce an error. If a new index is added, the optimizer may pick a better access path.\n+\n+The plan cache must be able to find and remove plans that have become invalid after changing the catalog. \n+\n+### 1.2 Query\n+\n+The query consists of the query string, the current schema, and parameters. Each of them may influence the optimization result.\n+\n+The current schema affects object resolution. For example, the query `SELECT * FROM map` may refer to `IMap` or `ReplicatedMap`\n+depending on the current schema (`partitioned` or `replicated`). \n+\n+Parameter values may alter statistics derivation and access path selection. For example, `SELECT ... FROM sales WHERE region=?`\n+may have different optimal plans for regions `EMEA` and `APAC`.  \n+ \n+The plan cache must use query content properly to ensure the correctness and efficiency of the query execution.  \n+ \n+### 1.3 Metadata\n+ \n+In the query optimization theory, metadata is external information that is used for optimization. Examples are \n+statistics, column uniqueness, data distribution, etc.\n+\n+In this document, we consider only partition distribution because this is the only metadata we use in our optimizer, \n+that is not part of the catalog, and that could change across query runs.\n+\n+Every plan is built for the specific partition distribution. That is, the distribution and participating members are saved \n+in the plan.\n+\n+The plan cache must be able to find and remove plans with obsolete partition distribution. \n+ \n+## 2. Design\n+\n+### 2.1 Plan Key\n+\n+The plan key is a key used to locate the cache plan. It should be possible to derive the key from the query before the \n+optimization phase. \n+\n+We use the following key:\n+```\n+PlanKey {\n+    List<List<String>> searchPaths;\n+    String sql;\n+}\n+```\n+`searchPaths` is the list of schemas that are used to resolve non-fully qualified objects during query parsing. Search paths\n+are created based on configured table resolvers, and the current schema. `sql` is a query string.   \n+\n+For the same catalog, two queries with the same search paths, and the same query string will always resolve the same objects. \n+On the contrary, the same query string may resolve different objects for different search paths, as shown in section 1.2. \n+Therefore, search paths must be part of the key.  \n+\n+### 2.2 Data Structure\n+\n+We use `ConcurrentHashMap` to store cached plans. `PlanKey` is a key, the plan is a value.\n+ \n+### 2.3 Maximum Size and Plan Eviction\n+\n+The maximum size of the cache is required to prevent out-of-memory if too many distinct queries are submitted.\n+\n+When a plan is added to the map, the map size is checked. If the map size is greater than the maximum size, some plans are \n+evicted. \n+\n+Eviction is synchronous because the asynchronous variant is prone to out-of-memory. We assume that for the most workloads \n+evictions should be rare. \n+\n+We use the LRU (least recently used) approach to find the plans to evict. Whenever a plan is accessed, it's `lastUsed` field is \n+updated with the current time. During the eviction, plans are sorted by their `lastUsed` values, and the least recently used\n+plans are removed.   \n+\n+### 2.4 Reacting to Catalog and Partition Distribution Changes\n+\n+If a catalog or partition distribution is changed, some plans must be invalidated. There are two different ways to achieve \n+this: `push` and `pull`.\n+\n+With the `push` approach, the plan cache is notified about a change, from the relevant component. E.g., if an index is created,\n+then the map service notifies the plan cache about the change. The advantage of this solution is that any change is reflected \n+in the plan cache immediately. However, this approach increases coupling, because many components (map service, \n+replicated map service, partition service) now have to be aware of the SQL subsystem. This approach also requires complex\n+synchronization between query optimizer, plan cache, and dependent components, to ensure that no stale plan is ever cached.\n+\n+With the `pull` approach, the SQL subsystem queries other components periodically, collects the changes, and invalidates \n+affected plans. The advantage of this approach is simplicity. No synchronization or changes to other components are needed. \n+Invalid plans are guaranteed to be removed eventually. The downside is that invalid plans might be active for some time after\n+the change has occurred.\n+\n+We choose the `pull` approach due to simplicity and sufficient guarantees. The background worker reconstructs the catalog \n+periodically, and verifies that existing plans are compatible with the current catalog and partition distribution. \n+\n+To counter the problem with outdated plans, we add a special `invalidatePlan` flag to `QueryException`. If an invalid plan\n+is used, an exception with this flag will be thrown at some point. When the initiator member receives an exception with \n+this flag, the plan is invalidated. \n+\n+Note that currently, users will have to re-execute the query in this case. In future versions, we will add a transparent\n+query retry, so that invalid plans will not be visible to users.
