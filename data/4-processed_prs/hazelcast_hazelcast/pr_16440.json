Both approaches are fine and both approaches work\nbetter in some scenarios. Since the listener is loss tolerant, we can\nskip items from headSequence..tailSequence+1 anyway.\n\nFixed the test to adhere to the new behaviour. We assume that eventually\nas we publish an item, it will reach the listener.\n\nA better fix would be to introduce unique IDs per ringbuffer, where we\nwould then be able to distinguish between a completely lost ringbuffer\nand a ringbuffer which has not received the last few items and\nappropriately reset the requested sequence to the headSequence or\ntailSequence.\n\nFixes: https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/16430", "committedDate": "2020-01-09T10:31:38Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "a1cb58212ef01321041fcf6ba8159969e8322d92", "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/commit/a1cb58212ef01321041fcf6ba8159969e8322d92", "message": "Address review comments", "committedDate": "2020-01-09T10:31:38Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "872c8c7f802df1619b8a48010a4ac3189178486b", "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/commit/872c8c7f802df1619b8a48010a4ac3189178486b", "message": "Checkstyle", "committedDate": "2020-01-09T10:31:59Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "872c8c7f802df1619b8a48010a4ac3189178486b", "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/commit/872c8c7f802df1619b8a48010a4ac3189178486b", "message": "Checkstyle", "committedDate": "2020-01-09T10:31:59Z", "type": "forcePushed"}]}
