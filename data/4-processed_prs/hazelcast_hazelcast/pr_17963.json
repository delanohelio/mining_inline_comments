Not sure how did I miss Javadoc on a public API.\nIt did not understand what you mean by client element.\nAnd I think we explain much more here. The term connection retries can easily confuse users. Similarly I would replace the same term in the javadoc of getTryCount.\nA suggestion from me:\nSets the count of attempts to connect to a cluster. For each alternative cluster, a client will try to connect to the cluster respecting related ConnectionRetryConfig. When the client can not connect a cluster, it will try to connect tryCount times going over the alternative client configs in a round-robin session.\nThis is triggered at the start and also when the client disconnects from the cluster and can not connect back to it by exhausting attempts described in ConnectionRetryConfig. In that case, the client will continue from where it is left off in ClientConfig lists, and try the next one again in round-robin tryCount times.", "author": "sancar", "createdAt": "2020-12-11T07:22:47Z", "path": "hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/client/config/ClientFailoverConfig.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -79,27 +93,62 @@ public static ClientFailoverConfig load() {\n         }\n     }\n \n+    /**\n+     * Adds the client config to the end of the alternative client configurations list.\n+     *\n+     * @param clientConfig the ClientConfig to add\n+     * @return this for chaining\n+     */\n     public ClientFailoverConfig addClientConfig(ClientConfig clientConfig) {\n         validateClientConfig(clientConfig);\n         clientConfigs.add(clientConfig);\n         return this;\n     }\n \n+    /**\n+     * Sets the count of connection retries by the client to the alternative clusters.\n+     * <p>\n+     * When this value is reached and the client still could not connect to a cluster,\n+     * the client shuts down.
