The reason for this need is that YAML defines mappings, therefore, it does not allow duplicates, while XML does allow it. The consequence is that the resulting Config may be different for the XML and the YAML case if the main and the imported documents have the \"same\" config (map with the same name for example). There is an ambiguity check though, so actual (scalar) config entries with different values result in failing fast with an InvalidConfigurationException. It can be argued though if spreading the \"same\" configuration across files is a good practice. I think it is not.\nI don't see though how this behavior change impacts config override. We first build a single DOM, then we process it where the overrides can be applied.

So since you changed from new MapConfig() to config.getMapConfig() in the processor, you get a MapConfig with the previously set attributes. So technically, instead of replacing the MapConfig, with your change, we start merging in XML too, just like we do with YAML. If I get this right, I agree, the test needs to be modified since we introduce a behavioral change here, which is also a behavioral unification.
