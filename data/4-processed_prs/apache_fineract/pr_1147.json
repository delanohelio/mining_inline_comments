All I did was to reorganise the existing content - I was not trying to make any functional changes at this point, so did not remove any of the settings.\nI have another PR ready to further reorganise the content by e.g. grouping all the plugin configurations together. But once we have the contents structured in a more sensible way, then it should be easy to see whether all of the settings are actually needed and remove the ones that are not.", "author": "ptuomola", "createdAt": "2020-07-14T02:30:59Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ1NDAxODAyNA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ1NDE4MDA3OA==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/1147#discussion_r454180078", "bodyText": "SGTM.
