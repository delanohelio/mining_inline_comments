I hope you therefore don't mind if I Commit Suggestion here - I'm very curious to see if it will also pass on Travis! (I think it will.) If it does, you can still decide if you want to remove $rootDir/elsewhere, or just locally make this change (or pull & squash this) and force push it, so that we can merge it.
