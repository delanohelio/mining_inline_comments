For each row's loanId:\n\n\nIf we already have a map entry for that loanId, add the dates to the existing entry\nIf we don't yet have a map entry for that loanId, create a new one and add the dates to that\n\nNo rs.previous() required, and either way you should end up with the same Map - as far as I can see..\nBut I don't have a way to test this code, so a bit concerned I may have missed something...", "author": "ptuomola", "createdAt": "2020-06-12T04:14:08Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzOTE1MzQyNQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzOTIxNjMwMQ==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/1024#discussion_r439216301", "bodyText": "Totally makes sense now.

It's too minor to hold back merging this important fix, so I'll just go ahead and merge it ASAP, and let you raise a very small minor follow-up PR, if you like (or not, fine).
