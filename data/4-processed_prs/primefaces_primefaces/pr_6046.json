Currently, these are for version 2.2 (as js-cookie has only a release candidate of version 3 so far). Eventually we should just use that (installed via npm during the build process).\nIn preparation for that, it would be good to rename the namespace and interface so that it matches what's on DefinitelyTyped:\ndeclare namespace Cookies {\n\t/**\n\t * Represents the properties of a cookie, other that its name and value.\n\t */\n\texport interface CookieAttributes {\n        }\n}\n(and change the parts in core.js accordingly)", "author": "blutorange", "createdAt": "2020-06-17T17:46:42Z", "path": "src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/primefaces/core/js.cookie.d.ts", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,34 @@\n+/**\n+ * Namespace for the cookie Javascript Cookie, available as `Cookies.set` and `Cookies.get`.\n+ * \n+ * Contains some additional types and interfaces required for the typings.\n+ * https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie\n+ */\n+declare namespace CookieJs {", "originalCommit": "d9bc57539d606e5648a824c37a38a7debb0d3135", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "da2ac175a70ad535fd48a79dfabb08ffbd344cec", "url": "https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/commit/da2ac175a70ad535fd48a79dfabb08ffbd344cec", "message": "Fix #6045: Cookies add security if over HTTPS", "committedDate": "2020-06-17T19:36:42Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "bc98569994e04028f6fa54ea666d44d10f146fc1", "url": "https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/commit/bc98569994e04028f6fa54ea666d44d10f146fc1", "message": "Fix #6045: Cookies add security if over HTTPS", "committedDate": "2020-06-17T19:36:56Z", "type": "commit"}]}
