connect to a single server backed by the channel.\n\nThe logic in the channel is fully transparent for end-user and there is just\nenough to send message to it and subscribe for receiving on the other side.\nIf PUB/SUB model is used, all the subscribes (even over the network) going to\nreceive the same published message.\nIn case of PUSH/PULL only one subscriber in the whole cluster is going to get\nthe published message\n\n* Use Reactor for better threading control\n* JeroMQ is not interruptible-friendly: use control sockets to stop proxy loop\n* Name Reactor's schedulers to avoid daemon
