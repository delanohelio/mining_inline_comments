The layer offers enterprise, cloud-like features such as high-availability, scalability, dynamic API discovery, consistent security, a single sign-on experience, and documentation. The API Mediation Layer facilitates secure communication across loosely coupled microservices through the API Gateway. The API Mediation Layer consists of three components: the Gateway, the Discovery Service, and the Catalog. The Gateway provides secure communication across loosely coupled API services. The Discovery Service enables you to determine the location and status of service instances running inside the API ML ecosystem. The Catalog provides an easy-to-use interface to view all discovered services, their associated APIs, and Swagger documentation in a user-friendly manner.\n \n-## Prerequisites\n+[More information](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/getting-started/overview.html#api-mediation-layer)\n \n-The following platform is required to run the API Mediation Layer:\n+To learn more about the changes consult [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)\n \n-* Oracle or IBM Java SE Development Kit 8 (<http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html> or <https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/>).\n+## Contents\n \n-**Note:** Java 10 is not supported.\n+  * [Run API Mediation Layer locally](#run-api-mediation-layer-locally)\n+    + [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)\n+    + [Quick start](#quick-start)\n+  * [Security](#security)\n+  * [Run integration tests](#run-integration-tests)\n+  * [Certificates](#certificates)\n+  * [Contributor guidelines](#contributor-guidelines)\n+  * [Local configuration of services](#local-configuration-of-services)\n+  * [Onboarding Services](#onboarding-services)\n+  * [More Information](#more-information)\n \n-### Other development prerequisites\n+## Run API Mediation Layer locally\n \n-The following tools are required to build and develop the API Mediation Layer:\n+### Prerequisites\n \n-* Gloablly installed Node.js and npm are required to build the API Catalog UI.\n+Following platform is required to run the API Mediation Layer:\n \n-## Quick start\n+* Java SE Development Kit 8 \n+(<https://jdk.java.net/java-se-ri/8-MR3> or \n+<http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html> or <https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/>)\n \n-1. Install the package manager `pnpm` globally to build the project:\n+Following tools are required to build and develop API Mediation Layer:\n \n-    ```sh\n-    npm add -g pnpm\n-    ```\n+* Node.js version 8.x and npm are required to be installed globally to be able to build the API Catalog UI\n+(<https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v8.x/>)\n \n-2. Install npm packages for the UI:\n-\n-    ```sh\n-    cd api-catalog-ui/frontend/; pnpm install; cd ../..\n-    ```\n-\n-3. Install `concurrently` globally:\n-\n-    ```sh\n-    npm install -g concurrently\n-    ```\n-\n-4. Build all modules:\n-\n-    ```sh\n-    ./gradlew build\n-    ```\n-\n-5. Run all service on a local machine:\n-\n-    ```sh\n-    npm run api-layer\n-    ```\n-\n-## Authentication service\n-\n-The API Mediation Layer uses a dummy authentication which provides a default security provider for the development purposes. To log in, use `user` as username and password.\n+### Quick start\n \n-### (Optional) z/OSMF Authentication\n+1. Install the package manager `pnpm` globally in order to build the project:\n \n-Perform the following steps to use the real authentication service:\n+  ```sh\n+   npm add -g pnpm\n+   ```\n \n-1. Configure a valid z/OSMF instance using the following sample configuration:\n-\n- `config/local/api-defs/zosmf-sample.yml`.\n-\n-2. Modify [gateway-service.yml](config/local/gateway-service.yml) with z/OSMF configuration:\n-\n-```yaml\n-apiml:\n-    security:\n-        auth:\n-            provider: zosmf\n-            zosmfServiceId: zosmfId  # Replace me with the z/OSMF service id\n-```\n-\n-Ensure that the z/OSMF certificate is trusted by API ML. Use one of the following options:\n-\n-1. Import the certificate to the API ML keystore using `scripts/apiml_cm.sh --action trust` as described at [Trust certificates of other services](/keystore/README.md#Trust-certificates-of-other-services).\n-\n-   **Note:** The apiml_cm.sh script is now in [zowe-install-packaging repository](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/blob/staging/bin/apiml_cm.sh).\n+2. Install npm packages for the UI:\n \n-2. Disable certificate validation. For more information, see [Disabling certificate validation on localhost](/keystore/README.md#Disabling-certificate-validation-on-localhost).\n+  ```sh\n+   cd api-catalog-ui/frontend/; pnpm install; cd ../..\n+   ```\n \n-## Run unit tests\n+3. Install `concurrently` globally:\n \n-Unit tests for Java and TypeScript modules are executed as a part of the build process.\n+  ```sh\n+   npm install -g concurrently\n+   ```\n \n-## Measure code coverage\n+4. Build all modules:\n \n-To determine code coverage of all modules, issue the following command:\n+  ```sh\n+   ./gradlew build\n+   ```\n \n-```sh\n-    ./gradlew coverage\n-```\n+5. Run all service on local machine:\n \n-Ensure that code coverage for new code is higher that 60%. Also ensure that code coverage does not decrease for existing code.\n+  ```sh\n+   npm run api-layer\n+   ```\n \n-The reports in HTML format are stored at `build/reports/jacoco/test/html/index.html` for each Java module.\n+Alternatively if you want to use Docker to use the api-layer consult the [README](docker/README.md)\n \n-For the code coverage of a single Java module (for example `discovery-service`), issue the following command:\n \n-```sh\n-    ./gradlew :discovery-service:jacocoTestReport\n-```\n+## Security\n \n-You can add an individual test class with the following command:\n+The API Mediation Layer uses a dummy authentication provides as a default security provider for the development purposes. To log in, use `user` as username and password.\n \n-```sh\n-    ./gradlew :discovery-service:test --tests org.zowe.apiml.discovery.staticdef.ServiceDefinitionProcessorTest\n-```\n+[Learn more about security here](#https://docs.zowe.org/stable/extend/extend-apiml/api-mediation-security.html#authentication-for-api-ml-services)", "originalCommit": "094b3a52c42dcc04addef4ad787f57b20ba3e44f", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "64beccb151fafe88cd7fcb9ccb50e8a4c0ed2e6b", "url": "https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/commit/64beccb151fafe88cd7fcb9ccb50e8a4c0ed2e6b", "message": "link fix\n\nSigned-off-by: jandadav <janda.david@gmail.com>", "committedDate": "2020-05-27T06:52:33Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "4dc30fdde9b9a2d73d5fcc6e2dd5ae488fe5d223", "url": "https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/commit/4dc30fdde9b9a2d73d5fcc6e2dd5ae488fe5d223", "message": "link fix\n\nSigned-off-by: jandadav <janda.david@gmail.com>", "committedDate": "2020-05-27T06:53:25Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "e03140c40dc0444b4e92c9fc1800b8049712f17b", "url": "https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/commit/e03140c40dc0444b4e92c9fc1800b8049712f17b", "message": "Refactor description\n\nSigned-off-by: Andrew Jandacek <andrew.jandacek@broadcom.com>", "committedDate": "2020-05-27T08:35:54Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "f314b7b70d0966f1d90d705e7fa18340d4d23526", "url": "https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/commit/f314b7b70d0966f1d90d705e7fa18340d4d23526", "message": "Refactor for clarity\n\nSigned-off-by: Andrew Jandacek <andrew.jandacek@broadcom.com>", "committedDate": "2020-05-27T12:47:11Z", "type": "commit"}]}
