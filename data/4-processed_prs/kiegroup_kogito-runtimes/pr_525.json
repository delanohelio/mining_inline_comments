Check out the source:\n-\n-```\n-git clone git@github.com:kiegroup/kogito-runtimes.git\n-```\n-\n-If you don't have a GitHub account use this command instead:\n-\n-```\n-git clone https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-runtimes.git\n-```\n-\n-2. Build with Maven:\n-```\n-cd kogito-runtimes\n-mvn clean install -DskipITs\n-```\n-\n-3. Run integration tests\n-The integrations tests are skipped in the command above. To run the tests you need to have docker installed on your machine. To run the tests during the build, just remove the `-DskipITs` argument.\n-Possible issues - the tests are running docker containers using [testcontainers](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java). That by default requires access to the docker.sock file which might result in a security alert on your system and be blocked. In such case you'll see log message similar to 'Can not connect to Ryuk'. In this case do run the tests with following ENV variable set:\n-\n-```\n-TESTCONTAINERS_RYUK_DISABLED=true mvn clean verify\n-```\n-When the test run is interrupted though, you might end up with docker containers still running, check those using `docker ps` and stop when neccessary.\n-\n+Here are some of the most notable ones for quick reference:\n \n-Contributing to Kogito\n---------------------\n+- [Quarkus - Using Kogito to add business automation capabilities to an application](https://quarkus.io/guides/kogito-guide) - This guide demonstrates how your Quarkus application can use Kogito to add business automation to power it up with business processes and rules.\n+- [Quarkus - Getting Started](https://quarkus.io/get-started/) - Quarkus Getting Started guide", "originalCommit": "7ab4886602fb009d4b22776a97d332019acf200a", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyODYzOTU4NA==", "url": "https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-runtimes/pull/525#discussion_r428639584", "bodyText": "+1", "author": "evacchi", "createdAt": "2020-05-21T13:07:41Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyODYyNzk4NA=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyODgzNzg4OA==", "url": "https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-runtimes/pull/525#discussion_r428837888", "bodyText": "Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n            All original contributions to Quarkus are licensed under the\n          \n          \n            \n            All original contributions to Kogito are licensed under the", "author": "ricardozanini", "createdAt": "2020-05-21T18:34:29Z", "path": "CONTRIBUTING.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,112 @@\n+# Contribution guide\n+\n+**Want to contribute?

Great!** \n+We try to make it easy, and all contributions, even the smaller ones, are more than welcome.\n+This includes bug reports, fixes, documentation, examples... \n+But first, read this page (including the small print at the end).\n+\n+## Legal\n+\n+All original contributions to Kogito are licensed under the\n+[ASL - Apache License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0),\n+version 2.0 or later, or, if another license is specified as governing the file or directory being\n+modified, such other license.\n+\n+## Issues\n+\n+Kogito uses [JIRA to manage and report issues](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/KOGITO/).\n+\n+If you believe you found a bug, please indicate a way to reproduce it, what you are seeing and what you would expect to see. Don't forget to indicate your Kogito, Java, Maven, Quarkus/Spring, GraalVM version. \n+\n+### Checking an issue is fixed in master\n+\n+Sometimes a bug has been fixed in the `master` branch of Kogito and you want to confirm it is fixed for your own application. Testing the `master` branch is easy and you have two options:\n+\n+* either use the snapshots we publish daily on https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots/\n+* or build Kogito all by yourself\n+\n+If you are interested in having more details, refer to the [Build section](#build) and the [Usage section](#usage).\n+\n+## Creating a Pull Request\n+\n+To contribute, use GitHub Pull Requests, from your **own** fork. \n+\n+- PRs should be always related to an open JIRA issue. If there is none, you should create one.\n+- Try to fix only one issue per PRs\n+- Make sure to create a new branch. Usually branches are named after the JIRA ticket they are addressing. E.g. for ticket \"KOGITO-XYZ An example issue\" your branch should be at least prefixed with `KOGITO-XYZ`. E.g.:\n+\n+        git checkout -b KOGITO-XYZ\n+        # or\n+        git checkout -b KOGITO-XYZ-my-fix\n+\n+- When you submit your PR, make sure to include the ticket ID, and its title; e.g., \"KOGITO-XYZ An example issue\"\n+- The description of your PR should describe the code you wrote. The issue that is solved should be at least described properly in the corresponding JIRA ticket. \n+- If your contribution spans across multiple repositories, \n+  use the same branch name (e.g. `KOGITO-XYZ`) in each PR so that our CI (Jenkins) can build them all at once.\n+- If your contribution spans across multiple repositories, make sure to list all the related PRs \n+\n+### Coding Guidelines\n+\n+We decided to disallow `@author` tags in the Javadoc: they are hard to maintain, especially in a very active project, and we use the Git history to track authorship.
