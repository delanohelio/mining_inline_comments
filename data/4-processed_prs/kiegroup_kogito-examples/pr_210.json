The switch state \n+decides which language to greet the person in based on the workflow input \"language\" parameter.\n+Depending on the language the workflow then injects the language-based greeting via RELAY states.\n+Relay states are just \"pass\" states which do no execute any functions and only have the ability\n+to inject data into the workflow.\n+The relay states then transition to the OPERATION state which call a \"sysout\" function passing it \n+input parameter containing the greeting and the name of the person to greet: \"$.greeting $.name\".\n+The function then prints out the greeting to the console.\n+\n+## Installing and Running\n+\n+### Prerequisites\n+ \n+You will need:\n+  - Java 11+ installed\n+  - Environment variable JAVA_HOME set accordingly\n+  - Maven 3.6.2+ installed\n+\n+### Compile and Run in Local Dev Mode\n+\n+```sh\n+mvn clean compile spring-boot:run\n+```\n+\n+### Package and Run using uberjar\n+\n+```sh\n+mvn clean package\n+```\n+\n+To run the generated native executable, generated in `target/`, execute\n+\n+```sh\n+java -jar target/serverless-workflow-greeting-springboot.jar\n+```\n+", "originalCommit": "46d9f245539175eab9eb30cb6b0d5b07c8e9be0a", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwODA4MDc2Ng==", "url": "https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/pull/210#discussion_r408080766", "bodyText": "just curl. thanks.", "author": "tsurdilo", "createdAt": "2020-04-14T12:00:49Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwNzg4NTkxMw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwODY1MDg1MA==", "url": "https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/pull/210#discussion_r408650850", "bodyText": "In that case please put here the instructions for Swagger (as is in other Spring Boot examples - mind that there's difference in those instructions between quarkus and boot examples).
