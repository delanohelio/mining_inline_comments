Although Event sound like a reasonable feature in the context of LoRaWAN.\n\n\nIn any case, at the moment, a LoRaWAN device doesn't have the ability to send an empty payload.\n\nYou mean because the Lora adapter doesn't support this?\n\nExactly. I wouldn't simply switch, but as you mentioned above, find a nice way to let the user choose.
