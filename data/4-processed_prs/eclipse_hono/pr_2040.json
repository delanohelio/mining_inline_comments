I would have expected it to be used in the place that up til now getCommandAckTimeout() was used in (i.e. in CommandSubscriptionsManager.startTimer).\nFor backwards compatibility, the commandAckTimeout value should still be used if sendMessageToDeviceTimeout isn't set.\nBut then there is a conflict with using ClientConfigProperties#getSendMessageTimeout() as default for sendMessageToDeviceTimeout. That means that assigning the default value of sendMessageToDeviceTimeout in the constructor would have to be changed (in favor of applying the order of precedence of the 3 possible values in the getSendMessageToDeviceTimeout method above).\nBut, I now think that using the sendMessageTimeout value of the messaging configuration properties as default value might be too confusing here after all. It's also the first time that we have properties of different endpoints influence one another. And also from the constructor signature it doesn't become clear, which actual ClientConfigProperties are to be used here.\nI think, for the time being (until we have an extra set of some default properties), we should just use the 1 second actual default value of sendMessageTimeout as default for sendMessageToDeviceTimeout, not using the messaging client properties here.
