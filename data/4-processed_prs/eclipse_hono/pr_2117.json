CoAP offers a very efficient piggybacked response, if that could be generated in time. This timeout waits for responding. If it expires without result, a ACK is sent and the response later. If the  result is available in time, it is sent as piggybacked response.

If the response is available before that timeout, a more efficient piggybacked response is used. If the timeout is reached without having received a response, an ACK is sent and the response is sent later when is has become available.
