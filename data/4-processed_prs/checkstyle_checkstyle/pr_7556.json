All  of them should be executed on local, with exception of very specific build items. Good example of such concept is pitest.sh , it is executed in circleci but can be executed at any CI.\n@strkkk, @pbludov , please review this concept", "author": "romani", "createdAt": "2020-02-19T02:46:01Z", "path": "wercker.yml", "diffHunk": "@@ -193,6 +193,16 @@ build:\n           echo \"build is skipped ...\"\n         fi\n \n+  - script:", "originalCommit": "6413ca7090a08ff5d03d462f0fabd55c46c313fe", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4MTA1MTE5NQ==", "url": "https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/7556#discussion_r381051195", "bodyText": "I inverted the commented section.

Too many commands in 1 file will make it become huge and possibly more problematic to maintain. CIs may change but the job the script is doing usually won't. What about splitting them by a type? We could have 1 script that contains everything regression related, etc... This is similar to the pitest script. Maybe any misc jobs that don't fit a type could be put into a plain run script.", "author": "rnveach", "createdAt": "2020-02-19T03:01:05Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4MTA1MDE5Mg=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4MTA4MTgxNw==", "url": "https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/7556#discussion_r381081817", "bodyText": "What about splitting them by a type?\n\nThis is exactly what I meant, but looks like lost in writing", "author": "romani", "createdAt": "2020-02-19T05:17:52Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4MTA1MDE5Mg=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "274c78b3641d06bd31465eb0c101a76839867cdb", "url": "https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/commit/274c78b3641d06bd31465eb0c101a76839867cdb", "message": "config: added javadoc checkstyle regression (#7556)", "committedDate": "2020-02-19T02:49:10Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "274c78b3641d06bd31465eb0c101a76839867cdb", "url": "https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/commit/274c78b3641d06bd31465eb0c101a76839867cdb", "message": "config: added javadoc checkstyle regression (#7556)", "committedDate": "2020-02-19T02:49:10Z", "type": "forcePushed"}]}
