That if we'd only use the orientation, it would also trigger for laptops and desktops but not for smartphones in vertical mode.\nSo if we were to use orientation it would have to be in a combination with a (max)-width. In this PRs suggestion we handle everything with a width of up to 823px whether it being in horizontal or vertical mode. And in this case we don't want do differ between those modes because we define everything up to 823px as a smartphone or mobile device which should display the mobile version of the page. I don't think we'd gain anything by using an orientation", "author": "jo2", "createdAt": "2020-07-08T10:31:18Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ1MTExMTE2NQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}]}
