column separator is correct (from a default Excel export it is \u201c;\u201d) and set the line number of the heading and the first data line.\r\n+Then select a _RequirementsConfiguration_ which should be container for the new requirement type.\r\n+It is also possible to select an existing _requirement_ type for the import.\r\n+For more information got to the next section <<Map CSV requirements

support; values are not validated when importing requirement values.\r\n+Unselected columns are not imported.\r\n+|image:chapterModeling/subsectionRequirements/CsvImportTypeCustomizationPage.png[Configure the imported type]\r\n+\r\n+|{counter:step}.\r\n+|Then select the _RequirementSpecification_ in

explains how these model based verification methods can be used and how custom project-specific verification methods can be integrated into the project.\r\n+\r\n+====== Configuration of basic verification methods\r\n+\r\n+Basic verification methods do not use the system model but are simple model representations to reflect external verification processes.\r\n+\r\n+To configure these basic verification methods follow these steps:\r\n+\r\n+:step: 0\r\n+[%header,cols=\">8,62a,40a\"] \r\n+|===\r\n+\r\n+|Step\r\n+|Task\r\n+|Image\r\n+\r\n+|{counter:step}.\r\n+|Add a _VerificationConfiguration_ to your _RequirementsConfigurationCollection_.\r\n+|image:chapterModeling/subsectionRequirements/AddVerificationConfiguration.png[Add verification configuration]\r\n+\r\n+|{counter:step}.\r\n+|Open the _VerificationConfiguration_ by double-clicking it in the navigator and use the `Add VerificationType` button to add a new verification method.\r\n+|image:chapterModeling/subsectionRequirements/AddVerificationType.png[Add a verification type]\r\n+\r\n+|{counter:step}.\r\n+|Configure the new verification type by specifying a name, description and what kind of verification it is.\r\n+|image:chapterModeling/subsectionRequirements/ConfigureVerificationType.png[Configure the verification type]\r\n+\r\n+|===\r\n+\r\n+Besides these basic verification methods, Virtual Satellite supports verification methods that use and link to the system model.\r\n+System model-based verification methods are provided via the different domain concepts.\r\n+For more information how concepts are developed check out our https://github.com/virtualsatellite/VirtualSatellite4-Core/releases/download/Release_4.12.1/VirSat_Core_Developer_Manual.pdf[developer manual]. \r\n+\r\n+====== Add verification methods to

the VirSat Editor.\r\n+Easiest way to do so is to press the `Drill-Down` button in the _RequirementSpecification_ or by double-clicking the element in the VirSat Navigator.\r\n+|image:chapterModeling/subsectionRequirements/OpenRequirementEditor.png[Open requirement in editor]\r\n+\r\n+|{counter:step}.\r\n+|Add verification methods in the dedicated editor sections of the requirement.\r\n+One requirement can also have multiple verification methods. \r\n+\r\n+NOTE: Basic verification types are created in the _VerificationConfiguration_.\r\n+\r\n+NOTE: System model-based verification methods can be added via dedicated editor sections.\r\n+Depending on the used concepts in the project there might be different of these model-based verification methods. \r", "originalCommit": "8b087380039e6dfc60394ca917a44a2bee70f47c", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "1d4c8e7789c8f7baa783d72993ea3aa2a025d341",
