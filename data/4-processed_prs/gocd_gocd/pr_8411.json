Which in turn required users with granular auth on\n  config repositories to perform material test connection.\n\n* Due to implementation complexities to allow users with access to config\n  repos to perform material test on such config repo materials, was not possible,\n  hence, the material test connection API was made accessible for all\n  authenticated GoCD users (in GoCD release v20.2.0).\n\nChangeset:\n\n* This commit brings back the authorization check to allow only super admin\n  and group admin users to perform material check connection.", "committedDate": "2020-08-03T06:56:51Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "cffbe4534d0a9a8b106eceb2272c2aaf599cc68f", "url": "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/cffbe4534d0a9a8b106eceb2272c2aaf599cc68f", "message": "Use config repos material test connection API on SPA", "committedDate": "2020-08-03T08:56:48Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "cffbe4534d0a9a8b106eceb2272c2aaf599cc68f", "url": "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/cffbe4534d0a9a8b106eceb2272c2aaf599cc68f", "message": "Use config repos material test connection API on SPA", "committedDate": "2020-08-03T08:56:48Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2NDQ1NDAwNw==", "url": "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/pull/8411#discussion_r464454007", "bodyText": "Are you planning to document the test connection endpoint?
