How would you feel about calling GrpcUtil.checkAuthority() (with try/catch) here instead? Then we could say that checkAuthority is normally performed in the builder so it should virtually always succeed. We then reference the bug id, and say we are working around cases where checkAuthority is disabled and we want to avoid them causing trouble here. We can also mention that underscore is the troublesome character.\nDoing it that way makes it much more obvious this changes no behavior change for most users and makes it more obvious if/when it is no longer needed (e.g., because the broken certs have been replaced).", "author": "ejona86", "createdAt": "2020-04-20T22:32:40Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQxMTYzNjE4Ng=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "6b9d8e7ac7343b776501ed66805402c73f252252", "url": "https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/commit/6b9d8e7ac7343b776501ed66805402c73f252252", "message": "Use GrpcUtil.checkAuthority for hostname validation.", "committedDate": "2020-04-20T23:26:43Z", "type": "commit"}]}
