Maybe the doc on onResourceDoesNotExist() is somewhat imprecise. The argument is the resource name that we are looking for but does not exist.

But at least, using \":\" + listenerPort turns out to be better than using null/empty string.\nActually ConfigWatcher also has somewhat similar issue, since resource-not-found may be caused by the intermediate RDS lookup, which uses a different resource name (other than what was used for registering the watcher) for the discovery request. In that case, the onResourceDoesNotExist() callback is invoked (and IMO it should be) with the actual requested RDS resource name.", "author": "voidzcy", "createdAt": "2020-04-30T01:24:46Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQxNzY4MzYzMg=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}]}
