We use a target instead\nof addresses as that is the approach we have wanted to encourage for a while\nsince it allows choosing alternative name resolvers.\n\nWe typically encourage injecting Channels, not ManagedChannels, which has the\nadded benefit of simplifying the example. Less indirection makes for a better\nexample.\n\nSwapping to target string could be done to examples-tls and examples-gauth as\nwell, but it would be much more invasive to the tls example and the gauth\nexample would need proper testing after the change.", "committedDate": "2020-01-22T21:28:43Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3MDI3MDA3OQ==", "url": "https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/pull/6630#discussion_r370270079", "bodyText": "nit: I would declare a local variable for channel as this expression is somewhat complex.", "author": "dapengzhang0", "createdAt": "2020-01-23T18:00:34Z", "path": "examples/src/test/java/io/grpc/examples/routeguide/RouteGuideClientTest.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -96,16 +95,11 @@ public void setUp() throws Exception {\n     // Use a mutable service registry for later registering the service impl for each test case.\n     grpcCleanup.register(InProcessServerBuilder.forName(serverName)\n         .fallbackHandlerRegistry(serviceRegistry).directExecutor().build().start());\n-    client =\n-        new RouteGuideClient(InProcessChannelBuilder.forName(serverName).directExecutor());\n+    client = new RouteGuideClient(grpcCleanup.register(", "originalCommit": "d2f52fe71d250e00456ea2ccf1529ca902dd3717", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3MDM1NzMwMA==", "url": "https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/pull/6630#discussion_r370357300", "bodyText": "I considered that as well, but when I tried it it didn't really seem to help much.
