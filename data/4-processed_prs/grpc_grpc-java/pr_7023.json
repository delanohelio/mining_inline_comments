Since this is a channel-creation issue, I think we can use a lower-level API without much pain. (Ideally in your other PR we would have done a lower-level API, but it was clear there wasn't enough infrastructure to support such a test, so we \"took the easy way out.\")\nYou can use clientFactory.newClientTransport() here. None of the ClientTransportOptions should matter, except ChannelLogger (can be created via transportLogger()). No, I don't know why ChannelLogger is passed as both an argument newClientTransport and in the options.\nAfter you have a transport, you'll call transport.start() and pass a Listener. We will expect the listener to fail in transportShutdown(). If we get transportReady() then the test failed. The listener will be called asynchronously, so you'll need to wait for the event. Easiest way to do that is probably using a SettableFuture (so on success do set() and on failure do setException()) and just get() in the test method.\nThat will produce a much \"lighter\" test that is much more direct. The test you have written here looks fine (and I could live with it if I needed to), but we try to avoid bringing in components unless we really need to.", "author": "ejona86", "createdAt": "2020-05-08T23:59:15Z", "path": "netty/src/test/java/io/grpc/netty/NettyTransportTest.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -106,4 +123,23 @@ protected ManagedClientTransport newClientTransport(InternalServer server) {\n   public void clientChecksInboundMetadataSize_trailer() throws Exception {\n     // Server-side is flaky due to https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8332\n   }\n+\n+  @Test\n+  public void channelHasUnresolvedHostname() throws Exception {", "originalCommit": "71f56cb3881edb430d6f549aa188d83866bf0c84", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyMjU2OTA3Mg==", "url": "https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/pull/7023#discussion_r422569072", "bodyText": "Thanks so much for your advice!\nThis makes a lot of sense.
