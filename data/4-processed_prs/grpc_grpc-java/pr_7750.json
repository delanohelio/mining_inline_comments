Previously DelayedClientTransport could terminate when some of its\nRPCs had their realStream but realStream.start() hadn't yet been called.\n\nTo avoid that, we now make sure to call realStream.start()\nsynchronously with setting realStream. Since start() and the method\ncalls before start execute quickly, we can run it in-line. But it does\nmean we now need to split the Stream methods into \"before start\" and\n\"after start\" categories for queuing.\n\nFixes #6283", "committedDate": "2020-12-22T20:55:57Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU1MzUyNDM2MA==", "url": "https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/pull/7750#discussion_r553524360", "bodyText": "Why not use @Nullable or @CheckForNull annotation rather than comment?", "author": "dapengzhang0", "createdAt": "2021-01-07T19:04:25Z", "path": "core/src/main/java/io/grpc/internal/DelayedClientTransport.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -346,7 +344,8 @@ private PendingStream(PickSubchannelArgs args) {\n       this.args = args;\n     }\n \n-    private void createRealStream(ClientTransport transport) {\n+    /** Runnable may be null. */", "originalCommit": "e8ffac75a220cf46b35c72ac524150612ff593bd", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU1MzU0ODM1MQ==", "url": "https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/pull/7750#discussion_r553548351", "bodyText": "All of those are equivalent, and I wouldn't spend any time debating which to use for a private method.
