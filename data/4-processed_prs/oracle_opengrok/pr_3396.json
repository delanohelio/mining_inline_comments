It makes sense for them to be terminating-aware so that when they're awakened they do no unnecessary work. If you have a for-loop that is just submitting to an asynchronous executor (as this code does), you have a minuscule amount of time where being terminating-aware has a chance of being effective.\nMoreover, shutdown() for a work-stealing pool only prevent new tasks from being submitted; it is an \"orderly shutdown \" that allows all submitted tasks to be executed. So again, the runnables should be terminating-aware for there to be any realistic chance of avoiding work.\nI recommend reverting to your commit 62b8e45 and just addressing the runnables.", "author": "idodeclare", "createdAt": "2020-12-07T18:54:49Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUzNzA3OTUwNA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUzODE1ODI2OA==", "url": "https://github.com/oracle/opengrok/pull/3396#discussion_r538158268", "bodyText": "You're right, addressing this in the runnables is better and actually more readable.", "author": "vladak", "createdAt": "2020-12-08T09:05:21Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUzNzA3OTUwNA=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "538c9b1f4fce134098324e6cf0f774d46758473d", "url": "https://github.com/oracle/opengrok/commit/538c9b1f4fce134098324e6cf0f774d46758473d", "message": "check terminating in init()", "committedDate": "2020-12-07T09:59:03Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "2115c1c61b198fc0979859e9069fe81cb7f3ae41", "url": "https://github.com/oracle/opengrok/commit/2115c1c61b198fc0979859e9069fe81cb7f3ae41", "message": "more the check", "committedDate": "2020-12-07T10:03:25Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "0b5f4264b81a1deac088ee265d4f63d5cd7a8c55", "url": "https://github.com/oracle/opengrok/commit/0b5f4264b81a1deac088ee265d4f63d5cd7a8c55", "message": "terminate the cycles in init()/rebuild()", "committedDate": "2020-12-07T10:18:29Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "0ccd600e4edcdea7a05ac952d3c2f967ce6ec4c1", "url": "https://github.com/oracle/opengrok/commit/0ccd600e4edcdea7a05ac952d3c2f967ce6ec4c1", "message": "Revert \"terminate the cycles in init()/rebuild()\"\n\nThis reverts commit 0b5f4264b81a1deac088ee265d4f63d5cd7a8c55.", "committedDate": "2020-12-08T09:03:03Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "3495007dcf807f538d7f327a29f88f06a4a24b64", "url": "https://github.com/oracle/opengrok/commit/3495007dcf807f538d7f327a29f88f06a4a24b64", "message": "check terminating in the runnables", "committedDate": "2020-12-08T09:04:46Z", "type": "commit"}]}
