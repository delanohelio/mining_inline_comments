I do not really like have such many public methods where it is not clear how to use them and what for. I would suggest moving all the other related code parts that are the same in parquet-cli and parquet-tools (and the unit test) so you would have only one public method that can be invoked with the input file, the output file and the columns to be pruned.", "author": "gszadovszky", "createdAt": "2020-12-08T11:28:05Z", "path": "parquet-hadoop/src/main/java/org/apache/parquet/hadoop/util/ColumnPruner.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,92 @@\n+/*\n+ * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\n+ * or more contributor license agreements.
