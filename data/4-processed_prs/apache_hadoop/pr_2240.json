You could consider increasing the weight of the highest priority queue, or extending the length of the highest priority queue. However, this simple feature is not a feature that can be used in all cases. If more fairness is needed among service users, then I believe that HADOOP-15016 would be required.\nThe case where I think this feature would be useful is when you have service users who are regularly running critical ETL jobs. A user who can make huge RPC requests at a moment may not be suite for a service user.", "author": "tasanuma", "createdAt": "2020-08-24T15:02:03Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ3NTYzNTM4Nw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4MjI3NTg5OQ==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/2240#discussion_r482275899", "bodyText": "@tasanuma curious why you choose to do it here and cachedOrComputedPriorityLevel instead of getPriorityLevel in the previous patch.", "author": "sunchao", "createdAt": "2020-09-02T18:21:44Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ3NTYzNTM4Nw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4MjYwNzQzNQ==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/2240#discussion_r482607435", "bodyText": "@sunchao Thanks for your review.\n\nWhen DecayRpcScheduler decays, it calls recomputeScheduleCache to recalculate the priority of all users, including service users, and put them in the cache. So we had to do this in recomputeScheduleCache as well. Lines 415-421 of the unit test cover this case.\nI moved it from getPriorityLevel to cachedOrComputedPriorityLevel because I thought it would be a little more efficient to determine if a user is a service user after looking at the cache information.", "author": "tasanuma", "createdAt": "2020-09-02T23:59:51Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ3NTYzNTM4Nw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4Mzk5OTU3OA==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/2240#discussion_r483999578", "bodyText": "Gotcha. Thanks @tasanuma . This looks most good for me. One minor nit is that the logic for handling service users now is separated into two places. Another way perhaps is to add this in computePriorityLevel which is called by recomputeScheduleCache and cacheOrComputePriorityLevel. We need to add an extra parameter for this method though.
