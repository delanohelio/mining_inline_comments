org.tensorflow.op.core.Shape.\nThese new operations manipulate \"dynamic shapes\" as detailed in the python code, as opposed to \"static shapes\" represented by org.tensorflow.tools.Shape. The primary use of this change is in creating and manipulating shapes within the TF operations, outside of Java code. Dynamic shape manipulations usually results because the static Shape has unknown dimensions or the shape needs to be manipulated within the graph to be compatible with another Graph Operation.\norg.tensorflow.op.core.Shape is a specific kind of operand that contains dimensions,\nbut any Operand that translates into a set of numbers (dimensions) works.\nFor example, tf.constant(new int[] { 1,2,3}), tf.slice(....), tf.concat(), tf.stack(), tf.shape(operand) or tf.constant(org.tensorflow.tools.Shape) all work equally. Also, the output of these all work with tf.reshape(),\ndefined as reshape(Operand tensor, Operand shape).\nAs far as I can tell, there is no way to create a org.tensorflow.op.core.Shape object from Operands containing dimensions. tf.shape() only takes the shape associated with the Operand, itself. Perhaps we need an operand that creates a org.tensorflow.op.core.Shape object from dimensions, but using an Operand of dimensions seems to suffice, at least at the level that I need to use these functions.\nThis PR creates three signatures for append, all for manipulating the dimensions of a \"shape\".\nOperand append(Operand shape, Operand otherShape)\nOperand append(Shape shape, long lastDimension)\nOperand append(Shape shape, int lastDimension)\nThe Shape versions of these methods require a Shape object but they are really a convenience in passing\nthe lastDimension as a Java int/long. Calling append(shapeObj, tf.constant(new int/long[]i) )\nproduces the same result, but is not as straight forward.", "author": "JimClarke5", "createdAt": "2020-07-02T20:58:44Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0OTIwODM2Nw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0OTY5NDI3MQ==", "url": "https://github.com/tensorflow/java/pull/80#discussion_r449694271", "bodyText": "closing this thread as it is identical to the one above", "author": "karllessard", "createdAt": "2020-07-03T20:04:07Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0OTIwODM2Nw=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0OTIwOTI3Mw==", "url": "https://github.com/tensorflow/java/pull/80#discussion_r449209273", "bodyText": "should the Operand here be Shape instead?

are referring to org.tensorflow.op.core.Shape.\nThese new operations manipulate  \"dynamic shapes\" as detailed in the python code, as opposed to \"static shapes\" represented by org.tensorflow.tools.Shape. The primary use of this change is in creating and manipulating shapes within the TF operations, outside of Java code. Dynamic shape manipulations usually results because the static Shape has unknown dimensions or the shape needs to be manipulated within the graph to be compatible with another Graph Operation.\norg.tensorflow.op.core.Shape is a specific kind of operand that contains dimensions,\nbut any Operand that translates into a set of numbers (dimensions) works.\nFor example, tf.constant(new int[] { 1,2,3}), tf.slice(....), tf.concat(), tf.stack(), tf.shape(operand) or tf.constant(org.tensorflow.tools.Shape) all work equally. Also, the output of these all work with tf.reshape(),\ndefined as reshape(Operand<T> tensor, Operand<U> shape).\nAs far as I can tell, there is no way to create a org.tensorflow.op.core.Shape object from Operands containing dimensions. tf.shape() only takes the shape associated with  the Operand, itself. Perhaps we need an operand that creates a org.tensorflow.op.core.Shape object from dimensions,  but using an Operand of dimensions seems to suffice, at least at the level that I need to  use these functions.\nThis PR creates three signatures for append, all for manipulating the dimensions of a \"shape\".\n\nOperand append(Operand shape, Operand otherShape)\nOperand append(Shape shape,  long lastDimension)\nOperand append(Shape shape,  int lastDimension)\n\nThe Shape versions of these methods require a Shape object but they are really a convenience in passing\nthe lastDimension as a Java int/long. Calling append(shapeObj, tf.constant(new int/long[]i) )\nproduces the same result, but is not as straight forward.", "author": "JimClarke5", "createdAt": "2020-07-02T21:33:35Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0OTIwOTI3Mw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0OTY5NDIxNQ==", "url": "https://github.com/tensorflow/java/pull/80#discussion_r449694215", "bodyText": "Ok I understand your point, it is in case the given shape is any kind of tensor and not necessarily the result of the Shape op, make sense.\nMaybe we should update the documentation then because it stated that all the endpoint returns \"a Shape\" while it simply returns any integer rank-1 tensor that could be used as a shape or not (it looks like nothing would prevent a user to use this endpoint for any other reason).\nIf we want to make it clear that it should be used mainly for shapes, maybe we should add a prefix to all this endpoints so that they are accessible via tf.shape.prepend instead of just tf.prepend?

The only thing though is that I'm pretty sure that when you ran mvn install on your branch, a few generated classes ended up being modified or added under src/gen/.

Many times in the Keras code, it tries to first resolve the shape statically using org.tensorflow.tools.Shape, but if it can't, it then resolves the shape dynamically using org.tensorflow.op.core.Shape.
