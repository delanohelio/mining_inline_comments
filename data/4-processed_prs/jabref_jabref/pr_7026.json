I meant of course the FetcherException instead of ParserException. The general idea is to use FetcherException for everything that is semi-forseeable (e.g. connection time outs, bad response errors etc). So that would be the case here as well.\nYou are right that it might lead to a bit more refactoring as it's a checked exception, but I see this as an advantage instead of an disadvantage. Makes the code more robust and ensures that we covered all the cases where the user might want to prefer to see a user-friendly exception message instead of only having a cryptic one or only a debug log message.\nNote also that you should provide the cause of the FetcherException already when it's created (since that's usual the point where you can figure out what went wrong).", "author": "tobiasdiez", "createdAt": "2020-10-18T14:36:10Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwNzE2NDQ4NA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwNzE4MDA5MQ==", "url": "https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/7026#discussion_r507180091", "bodyText": "I did follow the idea and used the FetcherExeption.
