IMHO it depends on the steps above (including jpackage, ...). Thus, we would need to duplicate 100 SLOC of the build file.\nWe could work with different jobs in the same build file. Then, we would need to introduce uploading the build directory (more?) to GitHub as data passing between jobs can only be done that way.
