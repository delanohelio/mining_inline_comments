Now that process died and another process created producer with similar name userProducer1 and started message with sequenceId=0 in which case UUID will not be unique.\nTherefore, using serverProducerName always gives a guarantee for unique producer-id and UUID. Adding new string serverProducerId will not create any overhead as well.
