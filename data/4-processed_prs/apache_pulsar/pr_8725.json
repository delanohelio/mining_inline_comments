So your suggestion would make the user happy anyhow.\nRegarding the trim: we are slightly changing the semantics, but as soon as you write a new message, the behavior is the same. Currently (AFAIK but I still have limited knowledge so I may be wrong) there is not strict contract about when a ledger is deleted (and also you won't know when it will be really deleted from the bookies).\nAll in all I would prefer this new behaviour:\n\nthe sequence of lastMessageId does not contain \"holes\"\nthe trim behavior changes but is it already unpredictable\n\nYou point \"data won't ever be deleted if there is no more write to the topic\" is valid, but I am not sure how much impact could have on production users.

If there are no writes going to the topic, it will cause accumulating one segment per topic. If there are a lot of such topics, it will cause disk filling up quickly.
