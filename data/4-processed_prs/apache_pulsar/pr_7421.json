Pulsar also supports SNI routing for geo-replication, so brokers can connect to cross cluster brokers via ATS proxy.\n+\n+### ATS Proxy setup for layer-4 SNI routing\n+\n+This section explains ATS-setup to enable layer-4 SNI routing and use ATS proxy as a forward proxy where the pulsar broker runs behind the ATS proxy and client connects to pulsar-broker through this ATS proxy.\n+\n+\n+![Snip20200701_37](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2898254/86283497-09ac5980-bb96-11ea-8b2b-45351977bd55.png)\n+\n+We have to configure two conf files into ATS proxy to support SNI routing.\n+\n+\n+1. `records.conf`: \n+The [records.config fil](https://docs.trafficserver.apache.org/en/latest/admin-guide/files/records.config.en.html) (by default, located in `/usr/local/etc/trafficserver/`) is a list of configurable variables used by the Traffic Server and we have to update this file with tls port (`http.server_ports`) on which proxy can listen and proxy certs (`ssl.client.cert.path` and `ssl.client.cert.filename`) for secure tls tunneling. We also have to configure a range of server ports (`http.connect_ports`) that can be used for tunneling to pulsar-broker. If Pulsar brokers are listening on 4443 and 6651 then add brokers\u2019 service port in http.connect_ports configuration.\n+\n+```\n+# PROXY TLS PORT\n+CONFIG proxy.config.http.server_ports STRING 4443:ssl 4080\n+# PROXY CERTS FILE PATH\n+CONFIG proxy.config.ssl.client.cert.path STRING /proxy-cert.pem\n+# PROXY KEY FILE PATH\n+CONFIG proxy.config.ssl.client.cert.filename STRING /proxy-key.pem\n+\n+\n+# The range of origin server ports that can be used for tunneling via CONNECT. # Traffic Server allows tunnels only to the specified ports.

The configuration is driven by the SNI values provided by the inbound connection. The file consists of a set of configuration items, each identified by an SNI value (`fqdn`). When an inbound TLS connection is made, the SNI value from the TLS negotiation is matched against the items specified by this file and if there is a match, the values specified in that item override the defaults. \n+Below example of  `ssl_server_name`shows mapping of inbound SNI hostname coming from client and actual broker\u2019s service url where request should be redirected. For example: if client sends SNI header `pulsar-broker1` then proxy creates tls tunnel by redirecting request to service-url: `pulsar-broker1:6651` \n+\n+```\n+server_config = {\n+  {\n+     fqdn = 'pulsar-broker-vip',\n+     # Forward to Pulsar broker which is listening on 6651\n+     tunnel_route = 'pulsar-broker-vip:6651'\n+  },\n+  {\n+     fqdn = 'pulsar-broker1',\n+     # Forward to Pulsar broker-1 which is listening on 6651\n+     tunnel_route = 'pulsar-broker1:6651'\n+  },\n+  {\n+     fqdn = 'pulsar-broker2',\n+     # Forward to Pulsar broker-2 which is listening on 6651\n+     tunnel_route = 'pulsar-broker2:6651'\n+  },\n+}\n+```\n+Once, ssl_server_name.config and records.config are configured, ATS-proxy server is ready to handle SNI routing and can create TCP tunnel between client and broker.\n+\n+### Pulsar-client Configuration with SNI routing\n+\n+Now, ATS proxy server is configured and ready to handle SNI routing and create TCP tunnel between client and broker.

With [PIP-60](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/wiki/PIP-60:-Support-Proxy-server-with-SNI-routing), pulsar-client supports SNI routing by connecting to proxy and sending target broker url into SNI header.

Most of these proxy-servers support SNI ROUTING which can route traffic to a destination without having to terminate the SSL connection.

This document explains how to setup ATS proxy and pulsar-client to enable SNI routing and connect pulsar-client to pulsar-broker via ATS proxy.\n+\n+## ATS-SNI Routing in Pulsar\n+[ATS supports layer-4 SNI routing](https://docs.trafficserver.apache.org/en/latest/admin-guide/layer-4-routing.en.html) with requirement that inbound connection must be TLS. Pulsar client supports SNI routing protocol and we can use ATS proxy in front of brokers, so pulsar client can connect to broker via ATS proxy. Pulsar also supports SNI routing for geo-replication, so brokers can connect to cross cluster brokers via ATS proxy.\n+\n+### ATS Proxy setup for layer-4 SNI routing\n+\n+This section explains ATS-setup to enable layer-4 SNI routing and use ATS proxy as a forward proxy where the pulsar broker runs behind the ATS proxy and client connects to pulsar-broker through this ATS proxy.\n+\n+\n+![Snip20200701_37](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2898254/86283497-09ac5980-bb96-11ea-8b2b-45351977bd55.png)\n+\n+We have to configure two conf files into ATS proxy to support SNI routing.\n+\n+\n+1. `records.conf`: \n+The [records.config fil](https://docs.trafficserver.apache.org/en/latest/admin-guide/files/records.config.en.html) (by default, located in `/usr/local/etc/trafficserver/`) is a list of configurable variables used by the Traffic Server and we have to update this file with tls port (`http.server_ports`) on which proxy can listen and proxy certs (`ssl.client.cert.path` and `ssl.client.cert.filename`) for secure tls tunneling. We also have to configure a range of server ports (`http.connect_ports`) that can be used for tunneling to pulsar-broker. If Pulsar brokers are listening on 4443 and 6651 then add brokers\u2019 service port in http.connect_ports configuration.\n+\n+```\n+# PROXY TLS PORT\n+CONFIG proxy.config.http.server_ports STRING 4443:ssl 4080\n+# PROXY CERTS FILE PATH\n+CONFIG proxy.config.ssl.client.cert.path STRING /proxy-cert.pem\n+# PROXY KEY FILE PATH\n+CONFIG proxy.config.ssl.client.cert.filename STRING /proxy-key.pem\n+\n+\n+# The range of origin server ports that can be used for tunneling via CONNECT. # Traffic Server allows tunnels only to the specified ports. Supports both wildcards (*) and ranges (e.g. 0-1023).\n+CONFIG proxy.config.http.connect_ports STRING 4443 6651\n+```\n+\n+2. `ssl_server_name.conf`: \n+The [ssl_server_name file](https://docs.trafficserver.apache.org/en/8.0.x/admin-guide/files/ssl_server_name.yaml.en.html) is used to configure aspects of TLS connection handling for both inbound and outbound connections. The configuration is driven by the SNI values provided by the inbound connection. The file consists of a set of configuration items, each identified by an SNI value (`fqdn`). When an inbound TLS connection is made, the SNI value from the TLS negotiation is matched against the items specified by this file and if there is a match, the values specified in that item override the defaults. \n+Below example of  `ssl_server_name`shows mapping of inbound SNI hostname coming from client and actual broker\u2019s service url where request should be redirected. For example: if client sends SNI header `pulsar-broker1` then proxy creates tls tunnel by redirecting request to service-url: `pulsar-broker1:6651` \n+\n+```\n+server_config = {\n+  {\n+     fqdn = 'pulsar-broker-vip',\n+     # Forward to Pulsar broker which is listening on 6651\n+     tunnel_route = 'pulsar-broker-vip:6651'\n+  },\n+  {\n+     fqdn = 'pulsar-broker1',\n+     # Forward to Pulsar broker-1 which is listening on 6651\n+     tunnel_route = 'pulsar-broker1:6651'\n+  },\n+  {\n+     fqdn = 'pulsar-broker2',\n+     # Forward to Pulsar broker-2 which is listening on 6651\n+     tunnel_route = 'pulsar-broker2:6651'\n+  },\n+}\n+```\n+Once, ssl_server_name.config and records.config are configured, ATS-proxy server is ready to handle SNI routing and can create TCP tunnel between client and broker.\n+\n+### Pulsar-client Configuration with SNI routing\n+\n+Now, ATS proxy server is configured and ready to handle SNI routing and create TCP tunnel between client and broker. Here, we have to note that ATS SNI-routing works only with TLS. so, ATS proxy and brokers must have tls enabled before Pulsar-client configures SNI routing protocol to connect to broker via ATS proxy. With [PIP-60](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/wiki/PIP-60:-Support-Proxy-server-with-SNI-routing), pulsar-client supports SNI routing by connecting to proxy and sending target broker url into SNI header. Pulsar-client handles SNI routing internally and entire connection handling is abstracted from the user. Users have to only configure following proxy configuration initially when the user creates a pulsar-client to use SNI routing protocol.\n+\n+```\n+String brokerServiceUrl = \u201cpulsar+ssl://pulsar-broker-vip:6651/\u201d;\n+String proxyUrl = \u201cpulsar+ssl://ats-proxy:443\u201d;\n+ClientBuilder clientBuilder = PulsarClient.builder()\n+\t\t.serviceUrl(brokerServiceUrl)\n+        .tlsTrustCertsFilePath(TLS_TRUST_CERT_FILE_PATH)\n+        .enableTls(true)\n+        .allowTlsInsecureConnection(false)\n+        .proxyServiceUrl(proxyUrl, ProxyProtocol.SNI)\n+        .operationTimeout(1000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);\n+\n+Map<String, String> authParams = new HashMap<>();\n+authParams.put(\"tlsCertFile\", TLS_CLIENT_CERT_FILE_PATH);\n+authParams.put(\"tlsKeyFile\", TLS_CLIENT_KEY_FILE_PATH);\n+clientBuilder.authentication(AuthenticationTls.class.getName(), authParams);\n+\n+PulsarClient pulsarClient = clientBuilder.build();\n+```\n+\n+### Pulsar geo-replication with SNI routing\n+\n+We can also use ATS proxy for geo-replication. Pulsar broker has capability to connect to cross colo brokers for geo-replication using SNI routing. In order to enable SNI routing for cross cluster broker connection we have to configure SNI proxy URL to cluster metadata. If cluster metadata has SNI proxy url configured then broker will connect to cross cluster broker via proxy over SNI routing.\n+\n+![Snip20200701_36](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2898254/86283369-c94cdb80-bb95-11ea-865e-34ddfe1ad33f.png)\n+\n+In this example, we have a pulsar cluster deployed into two separate regions, us-west and us-east.

The proxy server acts as a \"traffic cop\" in both forward and reverse proxy scenarios, and brings various benefits to your system such as load balancing, performance, security, auto-scaling, etc. There are already many proxy servers available in the market which are fast and scalable. More importantly, these proxy servers cover various essential security aspects that are needed by the large organizations to securely share their confidential data over the network. Pulsar provides proxy implementation which acts as a reverse proxy and creates a gateway in front of brokers. However, pulsar does not supports to use other proxies such as Apache Traffic Server (ATS), HAProxy, Nginx, and Envoy. These proxies are more scalable and secured. Most of these proxy-servers support **SNI routing** which is used to route traffic to a destination without terminating the SSL connection. Routing at layer 4 provides greater transparency because the outbound connection is determined by examining the destination address in the client TCP packets.\n+\n+[PIP-60](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/wiki/PIP-60:-Support-Proxy-server-with-SNI-routing) explains SNI routing protocol and how Pulsar clients support SNI routing protocol to connect to brokers through the proxy. This document explains how to set up the ATS proxy and the Pulsar client to enable SNI routing and connect Pulsar client to the broker through the ATS proxy.\n+\n+### ATS-SNI Routing in Pulsar\n+[ATS supports layer-4 SNI routing](https://docs.trafficserver.apache.org/en/latest/admin-guide/layer-4-routing.en.html) with the requirement that inbound connection must be a TLS connection. The Pulsar client also supports SNI routing protocol on TLS connection and that allows Pulsar to use ATS as a reverse proxy when Pulsar client wants to connect to broker through ATS proxy. Therefore, this section explains how to set up and use ATS as a reverse proxy so pulsar clients can connect to brokers through the ATS proxy using SNI routing protocol on TLS connection. Pulsar also supports SNI routing for geo-replication, so brokers can connect to cross cluster brokers through the ATS proxy.\n+\n+\n+#### ATS Proxy setup for layer-4 SNI routing\n+\n+This section explains how to set up ATS proxy to enable layer 4 SNI routing which will be used by Pulsar to use ATS as a reverse proxy.\n+\n+\n+![Pulsar client SNI](assets/pulsar-sni-client.png)\n+\n+To  support SNI routing, you need to configure two files: `records.conf` and `ssl_server_name.conf`.\n+\n+\n+- `records.conf`: \n+The [records.config fil](https://docs.trafficserver.apache.org/en/latest/admin-guide/files/records.config.en.html) (By default, it is located in `/usr/local/etc/trafficserver/`.) is a list of configurable variables used by the Apache Traffic Server and we have to update this file with TLS port (`http.server_ports`) on which proxy can listen and proxy certs (`ssl.client.cert.path` and `ssl.client.cert.filename`) for secure TLS tunneling. We also have to configure a range of server ports (`http.connect_ports`) that can be used for tunneling to the broker.
