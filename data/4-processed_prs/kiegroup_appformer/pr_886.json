They use the envelope API to exchange messages with the channel.\nA call to get a resource fire an async message to retrieve a certain resource content, captured by the envelope messaging API. Later the channel respond with the resource content, so the API finds the original callback to get the resource and call it with the resource content.\nIf you want a binary resource, for example, we will encode it using base64 because \"Base64 is particularly prevalent on the World Wide Web[1] where its uses include the ability to embed image files or other binary assets inside textual assets such as HTML and CSS files.\"[1]\nPlease let me know your thoughts.\nThanks!\n[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64", "author": "jesuino", "createdAt": "2020-02-04T17:35:06Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3NDQxMDI0Mg=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3NDk5MzY0Mg==", "url": "https://github.com/kiegroup/appformer/pull/886#discussion_r374993642", "bodyText": "ok @jesuino , it makes sense, let's keep it as it is, thx for clarification!", "author": "romartin", "createdAt": "2020-02-05T00:04:10Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3NDQxMDI0Mg=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "87f408ae471b569c85aeef2c46c10dc05d9b94f1", "url": "https://github.com/kiegroup/appformer/commit/87f408ae471b569c85aeef2c46c10dc05d9b94f1", "message": "Renaming Options to ResourceContentOptions", "committedDate": "2020-02-08T00:46:51Z", "type": "commit"}]}
