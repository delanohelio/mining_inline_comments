So this is handling the normal case where we are scheduling duties ahead of time and it completes scheduling before those slots occur.

When the slots occur there's no entry in the map so they execute immediately.\nIf however while the request for duties is in-flight one of the slots for that epoch occurs, that slot will replace this future with the one for it's own task and this call to removeWhenAllTasksComplete will wind up doing nothing. Responsibility for cleaning up moves to the task that was scheduled by onSlot (and this process repeats for each scheduled task - it gets tacked onto the end and takes responsibility for removing things).\nWhich I think is a long winded way of saying yes. :)", "author": "ajsutton", "createdAt": "2020-04-15T19:55:34Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwODkwNzg3OA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwOTE3NjQ4NQ==", "url": "https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/pull/1592#discussion_r409176485", "bodyText": "Thanks for the detailed answer :)", "author": "cemozerr", "createdAt": "2020-04-15T22:42:34Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwODkwNzg3OA=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwODkwODk3NA==", "url": "https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku/pull/1592#discussion_r408908974", "bodyText": "Isn't there any side effect of chaining multiple .always() to the same Future chain?
