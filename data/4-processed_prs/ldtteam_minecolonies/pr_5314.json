My point above is that according to the tags, cobblestone/stone are products of the stonemason, instead of ingredients. Given that they aren't marked as ingredients, you have to add furnace to the products to be able to enable it.\nMy proposal is above: add 2 things to stonemason_ingredient.json and 1 to stonemason_ingredient.excluded.json. I believe that fits the theming of the hut, and provides for a much wider array of recipes. I was thinking it might be good to also add #stonemason_product to stonemasion_ingredient.json, which should cut down on future maintenance here.\nIf you take my proposal, I believe there are several other things in stonemason_product.json that can be removed.\nAs an aside, is there a way to provide custom versions of these files for packs?
