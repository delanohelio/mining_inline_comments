The reason why I did it this way is because it's done this way literally in all other items too.\nSearch in the project for getTag() and look at the Item-Classes. Then look for getOrCreateTag(). See what I mean?\nI must assume that the devs have a reason to have it this way. For example, hasTag() takes into consideration isEmpty, while getOrCreateTag() does not. Maybe there has been a bug related to that in the past.\nSo, when the devs confirm that they simply didn't know about getOrCreateTag(), we should change that everywhere. Otherwise, I prefer streamlined code to individually smart code. You don't want future devs to think \"Ah, the banner uses getOrCreate, the others use getTag(), there must be a reason for this.\"\n@Raycoms?", "author": "JiaYow", "createdAt": "2020-06-22T19:59:29Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0MzQwODY3NA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0NDcxNzkzNg==", "url": "https://github.com/ldtteam/minecolonies/pull/5266#discussion_r444717936", "bodyText": "I believe we've been using hasTag() since forever for all the other items and getOrCreateTag() didn't exist yet.", "author": "Raycoms", "createdAt": "2020-06-24T08:06:50Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0MzQwODY3NA=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}]}
