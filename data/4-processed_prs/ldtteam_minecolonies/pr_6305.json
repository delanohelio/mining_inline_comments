Changed structure to instead use ResourceName.namespace + ResourceName.path (ie schematicsstructbackup1minecraftoverworldBlockPos{x=42, y=59, z=-208}.blueprint.\n\nThis will cause some ships to not properly despawn on the few machines that were seeing them before.  Probably not the biggest problem.\n\nFixes babarian->barbarian.\n\nFixes norsemen ships checking for biomes when spawned by command.  They will  still check for water/ice regardless; if there's not a valid ship spawning location they'll do their ground variant instead.  Norsemen ship natural spawns will still check for biomes.", "committedDate": "2020-12-27T21:20:18Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "e41c3adbc067e02d2c818564ed7d6fa567ecdb10", "url": "https://github.com/ldtteam/minecolonies/commit/e41c3adbc067e02d2c818564ed7d6fa567ecdb10", "message": "Further Fixes to Commands and Temporary Ship Structures\n\nExcludes norsemen_ship_raid and pirate_ground_raid from the events list, since neither group's ship variant can be guaranteed.
