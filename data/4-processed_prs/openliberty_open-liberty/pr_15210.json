I think it should be\n(1.0 & (3.0 | 3.1 | 4.0)) | (2.0 & 5.0)\nthe way that the filter is currently written it would allow 1.0 and 5.0 to be honored with the filter and that is not right.  The other feature checking will prevent that, but it would be good to get it written correctly.  As it is I am ok without this PR being done as well and just to leave the auto feature.\nIn review of another PR, I suggested leaving them alone even though they enable the same bundle.
