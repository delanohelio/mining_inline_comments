I added a commit that switches across to after and replaces the recommendation with a statement that applications should always follow the specification in closing connections.  It isn't just our recommendation. It's the specification that outlines the correct usage of the programming model.  This is more about us clarifying that, while we provide this option to help cover for incorrect usage, we are not advocating that customers disregard the specification.", "author": "njr-11", "createdAt": "2020-12-09T16:39:52Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUzOTQyNzM3OA=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "cb575a5ba4896d8175d4fcd5a7c8c354ccac85a5", "url": "https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/commit/cb575a5ba4896d8175d4fcd5a7c8c354ccac85a5", "message": "Issue #14762 address code review comments from ID reviewer", "committedDate": "2020-12-09T16:34:42Z", "type": "commit"}]}
