credential type. Their format is:\n`oh.<name>.<random chars>`\n\nThe \"oh.\" prefix is used to tell them apart from a JWT access token,\nbecause they're both used as a Bearer authorization scheme, but there\nis no semantic value attached to any of the other parts.\n\nThey are stored hashed in the user's profile, and can be listed, added\nor removed managed with the new `openhab:users` console command.\n\nCurrently the scopes are still not checked, but ultimately they could\nbe, for instance a scope of e.g. `user admin.items` would mean that the\nAPI token can be used to perform user operations like retrieving info\nor sending a command, _and_ managing the items, but nothing else -\neven if the user has more permissions because of their role (which\nwill of course still be checked).\n\nTokens are normally passed in the Authorization header with the Bearer\nscheme, or the X-OPENHAB-TOKEN header, like access tokens.\nAs a special exception, API tokens can also be used with the Basic\nauthorization scheme, **even if the allowBasicAuth** option is not\nenabled in the \"API Security\" service, because there's no additional\nsecurity risk in allowing that. In that case, the token should be\npassed as the username and the password MUST be empty.\n\nIn short, this means that all these curl commands will work:\n- `curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' http://localhost:8080/rest/inbox`\n- `curl -H 'X-OPENHAB-TOKEN: <token>' http://localhost:8080/rest/inbox`\n- `curl -u '<token>[:]' http://localhost:8080/rest/inbox`\n- `curl http://<token>@localhost:8080/rest/inbox`\n\n2 REST API operations were adding to the AuthResource, to allow\nauthenticated users to list their tokens or remove (revoke) one.\nSelf-service for creating a token or changing the password is more\nsensitive so these should be handled with a servlet and pages devoid\nof any JavaScript instead of REST API calls, therefore for now they'll\nhave to be done with the console.\n\nThis also fixes regressions introduced with #1713 - the operations\nannotated with @RolesAllowed({ Role.USER }) only were not authorized\nfor administrators anymore.\n\n* Generate a unique salt for each token\n\nReusing the password salt is bad practice, and changing the\npassword changes the salt as well which makes all tokens\ninvalid.\n\nPut the salt in the same field as the hash (concatenated\nwith a separator) to avoid modifying the JSON DB schema.\n\n* Fix API token authentication, make scope available to security context\n\nThe X-OPENHAB-TOKEN header now has priority over the Authorization\nheader to credentials, if both are set.\n\n* Add self-service pages to change password & create new API token\n\nSigned-off-by: Yannick Schaus <github@schaus.net>", "committedDate": "2020-11-30T18:52:47Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "c9c3e33a61d524a6b05e9643b32e284896b307e5", "url": "https://github.com/openhab/openhab-core/commit/c9c3e33a61d524a6b05e9643b32e284896b307e5", "message": "[cache] Added 'ByteArrayFileCache' (#1723)\n\nSigned-off-by: Christoph Weitkamp <github@christophweitkamp.de>\nSigned-off-by: Christoph Hofmann (MS) <chrisho@microsoft.com>", "committedDate": "2020-11-30T18:52:54Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "d27835729ea63c33e0d734036b3444f6432fc6f9", "url": "https://github.com/openhab/openhab-core/commit/d27835729ea63c33e0d734036b3444f6432fc6f9", "message": "[ui] Added unit test for read-only Number- and String-Items to not return a Selection Element (#1754)\n\n* Added unit test for read-only Number- and String-Items to not return a Selection Element\n* Improved usage of 'lastIndexOf'\n\nSigned-off-by: Christoph Weitkamp <github@christophweitkamp.de>\nSigned-off-by: Christoph Hofmann (MS) <chrisho@microsoft.com>", "committedDate": "2020-11-30T18:52:54Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "0b22b24294db5ee0fa982e3bd758df8abdc2affb", "url": "https://github.com/openhab/openhab-core/commit/0b22b24294db5ee0fa982e3bd758df8abdc2affb", "message": "Replaced static inline declarations by List.of() method (#1755)\n\nSigned-off-by: Christoph Weitkamp <github@christophweitkamp.de>\nSigned-off-by: Christoph Hofmann (MS) <chrisho@microsoft.com>", "committedDate": "2020-11-30T18:52:54Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "7a679eb3e9efe91c732137a9a8a588b19c27e214", "url": "https://github.com/openhab/openhab-core/commit/7a679eb3e9efe91c732137a9a8a588b19c27e214", "message": "[REST Auth] Clear session cookie only when deleting own session (#1758)\n\nFix https://github.com/openhab/openhab-webui/issues/441\n\nSigned-off-by: Yannick Schaus <github@schaus.net>\nSigned-off-by: Christoph Hofmann (MS) <chrisho@microsoft.com>", "committedDate": "2020-11-30T18:52:54Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "0007c0bf91c0f93268cef810a0f1fa76b70fc6ad", "url": "https://github.com/openhab/openhab-core/commit/0007c0bf91c0f93268cef810a0f1fa76b70fc6ad", "message": "[automation] Allow dashes in rule file names (#1750)\n\n* Allow dashes in rule file names\n\nFixes #1728\n\nSigned-off-by: Kai Kreuzer <kai@openhab.org>\nSigned-off-by: Christoph Hofmann (MS) <chrisho@microsoft.com>", "committedDate": "2020-11-30T18:52:54Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "72c3b67fb877d817ed8d7dc9de5aea9cd1562380", "url": "https://github.com/openhab/openhab-core/commit/72c3b67fb877d817ed8d7dc9de5aea9cd1562380", "message": "Add .gitattributes (#1767)\n\nWithout this configuration there are Spotless issues with line endings on Windows.\n\nSee: openhab/openhab-addons#8712\n\nSigned-off-by: Wouter Born <github@maindrain.net>\nSigned-off-by: Christoph Hofmann (MS) <chrisho@microsoft.com>", "committedDate": "2020-11-30T18:52:54Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "da4cfc1a0448e3e6db272feb09a7e66770498900", "url": "https://github.com/openhab/openhab-core/commit/da4cfc1a0448e3e6db272feb09a7e66770498900", "message": "Fixed typo in class name TrustAllTrustMananger.
