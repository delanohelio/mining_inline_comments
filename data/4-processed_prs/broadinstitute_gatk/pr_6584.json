Can I suggest being explicit about specifically not intending to capture germline variants?  I'm pretty sure that the code and default settings indicate that if the probability(germline) > 0.5 then it's excluded from the PoN.  This probability is configurable by CLI parameter.  Similarly, the number of samples required is configurable by a CLI parameter.  I only discovered this after digging deeply, as it's not advertised well elsewhere.", "author": "brianjohnhaas", "createdAt": "2020-05-06T12:42:25Z", "path": "src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/tools/walkers/mutect/CreateSomaticPanelOfNormals.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -31,8 +31,7 @@\n  *\n  * <p>\n  *     The tool takes multiple normal sample callsets produced by {@link Mutect2}'s tumor-only mode and collates sites present in two or more samples\n- *     into a sites-only VCF.
