input bam must have been sorted by UMI using FGBio GroupReadsByUmi (http://fulcrumgenomics.github.io/fgbio/tools/latest/GroupReadsByUmi.html).\n+ *\n+ * Use this tool to create, for instance, an insilico mixture of duplex-sequenced samples to simulate tumor subclone.\n+ * Suppose you wish to simulate a tumor sample in which 5% cells share a common set of somatic mutations\n+ * in addition to ones common to the entire cell population.\n+ *\n+ * If you randomly drop 5% of reads in sample A and 95% of reads in sample B and merge the reduced bams,\n+ * the resulting mixture skews the family-size distribution to the left. Here the family size refers to the\n+ * number of sequenced duplicate reads that share the same UMI.\n+ *\n+ * To see this, take a cancer sample, in which 5% of cells (i.e. a subclone) share a unique set of somatic mutations,\n+ * that was processed with duplex-UMIs (i.e. UMIs on both adapters) and high rounds of PCR. Suppose we have the sequence-ready\n+ * libraries of this sample attached to and amplified on the flowcell. Now, sort the flowcell lawn such that the\n+ * 5% subclone moves near the top of the flowcell. This subclone must have the same family-size distribution as\n+ * the rest of the flowcell, at about 5% of the library complexity compared to the entire flowcell.\n+ *\n+ * Now imagine replacing this subclone with 5% of the *entire* flowcell from another sample prepared and sequenced similarly.\n+ * The library complexity of these \"graft\" reads is higher than that of the original, and, consequently, with other parameters\n+ * such as the number of PCR cycles and sequencing depth fixed, its family distribution would be skewed left---that is, the family size\n+ * would be smaller than it should be.\n+ *\n+ * This tool address the above problem by dropping a set fraction of _duplicate sets_, rather than reads, at random.\n+ * Implicit in this approach is that a read and its mate are dropped or retained together.\n+ * While trivial when the input bam is sorted by UMI and query name, this is far from trivial when one attempts\n+ * to downsample reads naively with a tool like {@link PrintReads}.", "originalCommit": "c14aa1527401cb1b4eaa1d545d1f966754403e4f", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwOTc5MjcwNQ==", "url":
