Maybe you would like to clarify the plan?\n\n\nThe default builder build() method can actually create a client with MultiRealm enabled for DEDICATED client. However, we disable this option by enforcing the validation logic. Was it intentionally done?\n\n\nIf this is the case, then the actual build() code can be simplified, right? Since half of the branches won't be called forever.\n\n\n\nRegarding what you replied,\n\nmore confusing to the user and adds more difficulty in the usage of the Builder API\n\nI guess what you meant is that if there are 2 ways of configuring the client and these 2 options are all available in one builder, it would be confusing that which one to use.\nI think we discussed this topic before. To make it clearer, my suggestion would be,\n\nThe new builder does not allow ZkClientType config. Assume this is for backward compatibility. So we should not introduce to the new APIs.\nFor the older APIs (deprecated ones), as long as the type is passed in, we auto-fill the RealmMode based on the type. Since you mentioned in the comment that the mapping is one to one, this is doable.\nIn this case, there won't be a confusing part, IMO. And we won't need these validation logics everywhere. This helps with future maintenance work greatly.\n\nNot sure if you agree, please feel free to schedule a discussion. Maybe I missed some usage.\nBTW, if you are concerned about the already published version, then we can deprecate the ZkClientType setting method in the builders to suggest users not using it for now. The validation part can be left in the code until we make the API clean later.", "author": "jiajunwang", "createdAt": "2020-06-30T18:25:06Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0NzMzMDA4Mg=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0Nzk1MTA2OA==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/1127#discussion_r447951068", "bodyText": "I think you're referring to\n\n      case MULTI_REALM:\n        try {\n          if (_zkClientType == ZkClientType.DEDICATED) {\n            // Use a realm-aware dedicated zk client\n            zkClient = DedicatedZkClientFactory.getInstance()\n                .buildZkClient(connectionConfig, clientConfig);\n          } else if (_zkClientType == ZkClientType.SHARED) {\n            // Use a realm-aware shared zk client\n            zkClient =\n                SharedZkClientFactory.getInstance().buildZkClient(connectionConfig, clientConfig);\n          } else {\n            zkClient = new FederatedZkClient(connectionConfig, clientConfig);\n          }\n        } catch (IOException | InvalidRoutingDataException | IllegalStateException e) {\n          throw new HelixException(\"Not able to connect on multi-realm mode.\", e);\n        }\n        break;\n\nReviewing this logic again, I believe this was a bug.
