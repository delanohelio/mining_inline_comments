If a user is calling this function incorrectly (passing in a past time), then the problem should show up during tests (by not triggering rebalance) instead of hiding it and let it slip to production; if a user is using this function correctly and wants to schedule a rebalance in the future at time=x, but somehow this function is delayed and is processed at time=x+1, then should that rebalance still happen? I don't think we should assume it's okay, therefore it should be rejected.\n@jiajunwang Functionally I understand your point; code-quality-wise I think this function should do what it advertises.
