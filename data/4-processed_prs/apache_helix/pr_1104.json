Note here it is a participant0, register and currentstate/{sessionid} callbackhandler of itself.\nThis does not normally happen in production,\nThe only case this can happen is that controller have CB for participant 1. At the same time controller and participant 1 both have session expiration.\nBack to the question, yes, the old session will be removed from participant point of view. But from router point of view (participant0 is also router as it subscribe to callbackhandler of current state), each existing callbackhandler of router would be called via lambda from zkclient event queue inserted by fireAllEvent() after session expiration.\n fireChildChangedEvents(entry.getKey(), entry.getValue(), true);\nThe lambda would install this watch.\nNote, this is normally not a problem as we don't have such usage case. Only if both participant and controller/router have session expiration at the same time.\nLater, we plan to make it clear the responsibility of who should install watcher. We can simplify the logic here.", "author": "kaisun2000", "createdAt": "2020-06-19T00:20:13Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0MjUyNTgwNw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0MjU4NDQ3MQ==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/1104#discussion_r442584471", "bodyText": "Make sense.
