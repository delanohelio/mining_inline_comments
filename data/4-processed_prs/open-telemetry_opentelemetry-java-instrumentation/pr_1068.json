Unless I'm missing something, there are a couple major differences between what fabian said and what is done in the smoke tests.\n\nThe smoke tests appear firstly to only verify the agent doesn't crash the runtime.\n\nThis is not so much a portability test, but a safety latch.\n\n\nThe smoke tests only seem to run in one JRE\n\nfar less important than the other point.\n\n\n\nThis thread is taking its own path, but I think it is important for folks to know the difference between what you would expect a profession vendor to have to do vs what is in this project. It is also important to ack that what is in this project is not limited to what's done today and it can catch up. It might be a good idea if we want to say we are doing portability testing to lift fabian's advice into an issue as looking at the amount of people working on this project, it is certainly accomplish-able resource-wise and it is nice to have someone tell you a free design of how to do it!", "author": "codefromthecrypt", "createdAt": "2020-08-22T00:44:31Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ3NDM2NTA5Mg=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ3NTAyNzU4NQ==", "url": "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/pull/1068#discussion_r475027585", "bodyText": "The smoke tests appear firstly to only verify the agent doesn't crash the runtime\n\nThis is not true.\n\nThe smoke tests only seem to run in one JRE\n\nThis is not true either.\n\nIt is also important to ack that what is in this project is not limited to what's done today\n\n\ud83d\udc4d and you would have been right about the statements above until recently", "author": "trask", "createdAt": "2020-08-22T01:10:03Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ3NDM2NTA5Mg=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ3NTAzMDk2OQ==", "url": "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/pull/1068#discussion_r475030969", "bodyText": "Might want to update the README with what's going on as yeah I didn't pull since when less than two weeks ago some of this changed,\n\nalso the build logs are not helpful understanding things as everything is inlined in groovy. there's no status message or visibility into matrixes due to this (unlike the actions which are using build supplied parameters.\nYou are right that right now, very recently there are a few frameworks smoke tested.\nEx. spring boot 2.3 (only this version) checks that spans are created from synchronous controllers using JREs coded into the test\nI'm sure you are aware that more problems happen than scenarios like this and likely Instana would be doing more than this.
