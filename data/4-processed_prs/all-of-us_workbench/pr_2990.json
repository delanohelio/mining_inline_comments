I'm not convinced that a separate dependency-injected class is worth it for the single usage instance here. If there's no other obvious advantage that I'm missing, I'm inclined to keep the \"am I in dev\" check local here.\n[Update] as a last-ditch effort, I tried seeing if the AppIdentityService branch would work correctly even when running locally. I tested this out locally and it does work fine (I suspect that somewhere under the hood there is a fallback call to GoogleCredentials.getApplicationDefault), but I'm not confident enough to push out that change.
