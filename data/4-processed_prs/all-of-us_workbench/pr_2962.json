I don't know how you evangelize things like this, but it's easy to move things in and out of packages (or rename them) without expecting any functional changes. Best case scenario, it falls apart on startup when you do that.\nAnother bummer is that you can't call something like getClass().getPackage() within an annotation, as everything has to be a compile-time constant. So if we rename any part of the package, it breaks, and we find out at runtime.\nWhat you can do is put a placeholder type at the top level of the package to be scanned. It looks like the syntax is @ComponentScan(basePackageClasses = org.pmiops.workbench.firecloud.ComponentScanPlaceholder.class). (Since it's generated, you'd have to figure out which class to use or put a placeholder in the yaml). ComponentScanPlaceholder can be an empty interface.\nFrom the doc\n\t/**\n\t * Type-safe alternative to {@link #basePackages} for specifying the packages\n\t * to scan for annotated components.
