After install click on the Docker icon, go to 'Preferences' and under 'resources' ensure you have at least 6GB dedicated to Docker. Then click on 'Kubernetes' and check the checkbox to enable.\n+ * For Linux there is no easy installer, but there are many options. These also exist for Windows, Mac & indeed Raspberry Pi. Search for topics like `okd`,`minishift`,`microk8s`, `k3s` . \n+\n+\n+The remainder of these instructions assume that you have a Kubernetes (k8s) cluster configured, and 'kubectl' available. \n+\n+## Helm\n+\n+[Helm](https://helm.sh/) is a packaging tool that helps in deploying applications to Kubernetes & is required by Egeria.\n+\n+Install [Helm v3.1 or above](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases) & ensure it is in your path.\n+\n+\n+## Running the environment\n+\n+1.
