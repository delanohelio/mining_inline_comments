This contains the name and status of the View Service and also contains a list of the resources that the Dino interface is permitted to access. These resources are platforms and servers that will appear in the selectors in the Dino interface. All requests to the Dino View Service REST API are based on these configured named resources. When a user selects a platform name or server name from the selector lists, the interface sends the resource name to the Dino View Service, which resolves the platform or server name to a resource endpoint to identify the URL needed to send a request to the platform or server. \n+The Dino View Service is an Integration View Service and is configured using the admin-services API to post the configuration to `open-metadata/admin-services/users/{userName}/servers/{serverName}/view-services/{vewServiceName}`. The configuration is supplied in `IntegrationViewServiceConfig`, described below or in the View Services README.md (see above). This contains the name and operational status of the View Service and also contains a list of the resource endpoints that the Dino interface is permitted to access. This list is a list of `ResourceEndpointConfig` objects, as in the example below, that represent platforms and servers.", "originalCommit": "bcda8ba08b32fd9f73dc17ae1bf001ab5abf5d11", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwMjM4Nzg5Nw==", "url": "https://github.com/odpi/egeria/pull/3755#discussion_r502387897", "bodyText": "Again - fear comment.
