All this is public API that - even in 7.x - we must support for a number of years.\nFrom kie server, it would mean not creating the SolverFactory directly from the XML, but using SolverConfig.create() first (so if and only if a SolverConfig.getScanAnnotatedClassesConfig() is not null, its exclude list must be modified) before creating the SolverFactory with SolverFactory.create(solverConfig).
