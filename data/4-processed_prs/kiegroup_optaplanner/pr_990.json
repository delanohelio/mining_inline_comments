I am not sure if that's still the case.\nEither way, if we drop description and/or url overwritting here, we should do that on all child poms at the same time, so it's a separate issue.", "author": "ge0ffrey", "createdAt": "2020-10-29T11:11:31Z", "path": "build/optaplanner-ide-config/pom.xml", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,12 @@\n+<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n+<project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n+         xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n+  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n+  <parent>\n+    <groupId>org.optaplanner</groupId>\n+    <artifactId>optaplanner-parent</artifactId>\n+    <version>8.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n+  </parent>\n+  <artifactId>optaplanner-ide-config</artifactId>\n+  <name>OptaPlanner IDE Configuration</name>", "originalCommit": "473da696da8b5d10539bcdf62960b1d27867b353", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxNTAyNjc4Ng==", "url": "https://github.com/kiegroup/optaplanner/pull/990#discussion_r515026786", "bodyText": "Let's add the description and url for now to keep it consistent with other modules.", "author": "rsynek", "createdAt": "2020-10-30T11:19:28Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxNDE3ODcyMg=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "ac0bdf6f3cc500684f90f0f2c92161c3a1dcd225", "url": "https://github.com/kiegroup/optaplanner/commit/ac0bdf6f3cc500684f90f0f2c92161c3a1dcd225", "message": "PLANNER-2223: Move ide-config into its own module\n\nBefore, ide-config was stored in a directory, which the\nformatter plugin needed to reference in order to format the\nfiles.
