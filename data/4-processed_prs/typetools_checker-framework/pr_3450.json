My reasoning is that because we're going to write the results of inference out to a jaif/stub file (neither of which can include fields with invalid names), we should handle ANY invalid names that we encounter, regardless of where they came from.\n\nWhy is the temporary variable considered a field in the first place\n\nI think it's just a quirk of how the CFG is constructed.\n\nI feel like we would want to do inference on temporary variables in an expression like int n = i++\n\nWe'll still do WPI on n in this example, and we'll compute the correct results because local inference will still run on the i++ node - but only n's inferred type will be written to the jaif/stub file.\n\nIt seems to me like the root of the problem is that in static blocks in particular, the temporary variable is somehow \"attached\" to the class as a field\n\nYes. I presume there's a reason that was done. If there isn't (and it's just an implementation detail that could be changed), I would still prefer this fix, because it has a much smaller blast radius (only WPI is impacted).
