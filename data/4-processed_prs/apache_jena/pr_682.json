Does it still send out an email alert?\nIf we had travis tied to, for example, project github actions, having a (non-failing) step for openjdk-ea makes sense. So if there is a preference and migration to use GH actions/Travis more (e.g. consolidating on GH for the sake of simplicity) then obviously this all needs revisiting in a new light.\nATM The travis file is for contributors. For the project, we do have Jenkins builds that reports as well. I'm not sure whether \"allow fail\" makes a difference - not sure people would look!", "author": "afs", "createdAt": "2020-01-28T15:06:15Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3MTc2NTc2Nw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3MjExODU4Ng==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/682#discussion_r372118586", "bodyText": "Oh, that's a good question. As far as I can tell, they are not reported. At least I never got an e-mail for openjdk-ea (early-access) in Commons projects.\nI think people wouldn't look. It would be more helpful for developers. But if that's handled in Jenkins, then I guess it's not necessary to have it in Travis.\nLink to allow_failures doc: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build#rows-that-are-allowed-to-fail", "author": "kinow", "createdAt": "2020-01-28T23:34:39Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3MTc2NTc2Nw=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}]}
