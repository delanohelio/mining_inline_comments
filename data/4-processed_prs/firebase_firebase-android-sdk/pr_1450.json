Additionally, repeated failing requests to Firebase may slow down the end-user experience of your app.\n+\n+## What do I need to do?\n+To fix malfunctioning Firebase services for your applications, **please take the following steps as soon as possible:**\n+1. Update your application by initializing Firebase with a valid API key of your project, a valid Project ID, and a valid Application ID (a.k.a. mobilesdk_app_id, GOOGLE_APP_ID, or simply \"App Id\").\n+    * **Default initialization process using a Firebase config file**: [Download your `google-services.json` config file](https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/7015592) from the Firebase console, then replace the existing file in your app.\n+    * **Programmatic initialization using a `FirebaseOptions` object**: [Download your `google-services.json` config file](https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/7015592) from the Firebase console to find your API key, Project ID, and Application ID, then update these values in the `FirebaseOptions` object in your app.\n+1.
