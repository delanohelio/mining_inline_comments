In this case, we're not listening to a log occuring, we're listening to the app logging the information.

If you were implementing the code for onButtonPress, you would probably have code in a controller that called a class with a method that looked like sendForm(...), not one that looked like onFormSent(...) The collaborator is requesting the sendForm action being taken, in that example.
