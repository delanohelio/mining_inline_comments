If a new sensor is created with the same name as an existing one, the existing one is returned rather than a new object being created. The partition load time sensors for the transaction and group coordinators used the same name, so data recorded to either was stored in the same object. This meant that the metrics values for both metrics were identical and consisted of the combined data. This patch changes the names to be distinct so that the data will be stored in separate Sensor objects.", "committedDate": "2020-06-02T16:52:46Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "68127aebf45308e4942eb456037273520c14bab7", "url": "https://github.com/apache/kafka/commit/68127aebf45308e4942eb456037273520c14bab7", "message": "Add group metrics constants", "committedDate": "2020-06-02T17:11:45Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzNDEyMjU1NQ==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/8784#discussion_r434122555", "bodyText": "nit: maybe we may as well add constant names for this as well as the metric group?", "author": "hachikuji", "createdAt": "2020-06-02T19:22:11Z", "path": "core/src/main/scala/kafka/coordinator/group/GroupMetadataManager.scala", "diffHunk": "@@ -89,7 +89,7 @@ class GroupMetadataManager(brokerId: Int,\n   private val openGroupsForProducer = mutable.HashMap[Long, mutable.Set[String]]()\n \n   /* setup metrics*/\n-  val partitionLoadSensor = metrics.sensor(\"PartitionLoadTime\")\n+  private val partitionLoadSensor = metrics.sensor(\"GroupPartitionLoadTime\")", "originalCommit": "82ada93ae5343f81a418b6d5da76d5b4fedd80cc", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}]}
