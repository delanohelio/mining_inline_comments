Even though they don't have tests, the :test target is convenient because it runs all of the compilation targets, as well as spotbugs and checkstyle. The idea is just to flush out any/all possible sources of failure so that we can be pretty sure that if :streams:testAll passes, then so will Jenkins.\nI agree it's a pain. Maybe we can consider either contributing a script to keep this stuff updated or writing some gradle code to build the list automatically.", "author": "vvcephei", "createdAt": "2020-08-10T15:14:31Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2MDI4MjQ1Ng=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}]}
