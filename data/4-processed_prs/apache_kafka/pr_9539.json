I am slightly confused regarding your comment though(maybe because of my limited understanding of the protocol) so plz help me understand here:\nThe block of code where i made. the changes, picks all the followers and adds them as the voters:\nList<Voter> voters = state.followers().stream() .map(follower -> new Voter().setVoterId(follower)) .collect(Collectors.toList());\nWhile the LeaderChange message schema, states that voterIds are all those voters who voted for the currently elected leader.\nContinuing on this, from what I understood in the handling of BeginQuorumEpoch response handling section in kIP-595, the moment a leader receives a response from a voter with no errors, it records an endorsement from the voter for itself. It also states that if a Voter accepts a BeginQuorumEpoch(and thereby sending the accepted response), it automatically transitions to a follower state for that leader. Lastly, the new leader will keep sending BeginQuorumEpoch requests to non endorsing voters until it doesn't receive them (or doesn't infer through the Fetch API in case of partitioning).\nSo, the questions I have are:\n\nSince the leader waits for the endorsements from all voters, doesn't it mean that eventually the followers method in LeaderState would return all voters? While the LeaderState message schema mentions that VotedIDs are those voters are voted for this new leader.\nI had thought that the nonEndorsingFollower method was used to find all followers who haven't yet endorsed for the new leader and keep sending requests to them. In that assumption, I am not able to follow your statement of adding a new method to add endorsingFollower wrt this PR.\n\nAgain, I apologise if I made some comments which don't make sense.

We thought this might be useful for debugging. Later on, we had a change of heart and decided it would just be the set of voters. Now I'm thinking it might be useful to have both. The log will always remember who the voters were at the time of the election and which voters had granted the leader's candidacy, which could be helpful in case of misconfigurations.\nFor the set of voters which voted for the current leader, I think what we want is CandidateState.grantingVoters. However, by the time onBecomeLeader is fired, we have already dropped the CandidateState. One option is to carry grantingVoters over to LeaderState. We might also be able to pass it through onBecomeLeader. This will be easier if we get rid of the call to onBecomeLeader in initialize().

Note that it is possible for a voter to have granted a vote, but not yet endorsed the election (because it does not know the vote succeeded).\nWe should not conflate these sets, but maybe we can come up with better terms to avoid the confusion. I would stick with \"granting\" voters as the set of voters who granted the leader's candidacy. However, maybe we can change \"endorsing\" to \"acknowledged\"?

The issue is on this line:\n\n  \n    \n      kafka/raft/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/raft/LeaderState.java\n    \n    \n         Line 52\n      in\n      ce275e2\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n        \n          \n           boolean hasEndorsedLeader = grantingVoters.contains(voterId); \n        \n    \n  \n\n\nNote that, this is a deviation from the original code which was:\nboolean hasEndorsedLeader = voterId == localId;\nand the test case which was failing because of this was this line in particular:\nhttps://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/9539/files#diff-01c9950503611c357b85ef5b8850d2fbc6060075ce028bf4f86dfc6cbd63fd3cR255\nReason being, when transitionToLeader is invoked from QuorumState upon becoming the leader, it passes in the set of granting voters. Keeping in mind the explanation provided by @hachikuji above, these are all the voters who voted for the current leader.\nIf you check the above erroneous condition, we are checking if a voter has endorsed the voting by checking if it is present in the granting voters list:\nboolean hasEndorsedLeader = grantingVoters.contains(voterId);\nSo, the problem is, this condition will force all voters to be considered as having endorsed the Leader even before the BeginQuorumEpoch request response dance has begun.\nThe test cases in question fails because the pollLeader() method in KafkaRaftClient, checks the nonEndorsingVoters and sends the BeginQuorumEpoch request to nonEndorsed ones here:\nlong timeUntilSend = maybeSendRequests(\n            currentTimeMs,\n            state.nonEndorsingVoters(),\n            this::buildBeginQuorumEpochRequest\n        );\n\nbut it never gets to do that because every granting voter has been marked as an endorsed voter.\nLastly, we don't really need the acknowledgedVoters here because all we need are the granting voters in the LeaderChangeMessage i.e the voters who voted for the Leader in the current  epoch.\nSo, I am reverting the changes and now, the test cases have all passed as well.
