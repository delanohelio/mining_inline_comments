Since we're the only users of the Percentiles class, we can just modify it directly and avoid restricting the values for the min/max metrics as John mentioned above. If a user is experiencing small negative e2e latencies it's likely due to clock drift, and approximating as 0 seems reasonable. If they're experiencing large negative e2e latencies, there's clearly something odd going on and the e2e latency percentiles aren't meaningful. But it will still show up in the min metric and alert them to this. Presumably users may be interested to know.\nI'd like to avoid introducing a config in particular because the maximum isn't an inherent mathematical property of percentiles (obviously), it's just an artifact of the existing percentiles algorithm. We can improve this and presumably remove the requirement to set a static max, but I felt the algorithm was \"good enough\" for now (and didn't want to make large scale changes and/or rewrite it entirely right before the 2.6 deadline).\nIn sum I'd say the guiding principle for this PR and the initial metrics was to be useful without being misleadingly wrong.

Maybe \"actual\", or \"proper\", or \"internal\" processing time?\nSo, my comment was that, given that we know the implementation of SourceNode, we know that it's \"actual\", \"proper\", \"internal\" processing time is going to be very small, probably far less than a single millisecond. So it doesn't make any practical difference whether we measure before the call for just the special case of source nodes, or magically solve the problem of measuring the e2e latency after internal processing, but not including the calls to \"forward\".\nThis is why I think it's fine to measure SourceNodes before the call to process, even though the KIP technically specifies that processors' end-to-end latencies should include processing latency.
