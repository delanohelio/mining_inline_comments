Once in recordConnectionAndGetThrottleTimeMs and once here. I wonder if we could look it up once to record the rate and to record the throttle time.\nI am thinking about the following to be more concrete. We could add two methods in ListenerConnectionQuota: 1) record and 2) recordThrottleTime. They would encapsulate the logic to respectively record the rate (for the listener and the broker like we do now) and the throttle time. So here we could look up the ListenerConnectionQuota record and get the throttle time, and record the throttle time if > 0.\nThat could improve the readability a bit. I am not sure that it would make a difference from a performance point of view.
