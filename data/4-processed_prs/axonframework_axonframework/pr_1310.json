As I already had the\nrough pseudo code available, I figured an actual implementation wouldn't\n hurt too. To this end an abstract implementation of the\n SingleEventUpcaster should be provided, with abstract function to\n retrieve the expected and upcasted payload type / revision. Other\n methods used during canUpcast and doUpcast should be made protected to\n allow overriding by the user\n\n#event-type-upcaster", "committedDate": "2020-01-07T14:17:49Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "63aa0977f3a82bd1d162055728843477f2f3ad57", "url": "https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/commit/63aa0977f3a82bd1d162055728843477f2f3ad57", "message": "Use interface instead of concrete type\n\nThe test should utilize IntermediateEventRepresentation objects instead\nof InitialEventRepresentation for consistency\n\n#1310", "committedDate": "2020-01-07T14:25:15Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM2NDQ0ODkyMw==", "url": "https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1310#discussion_r364448923", "bodyText": "Curious, why an abstract class and not a class where the expectedPayloadType, expectedRevision and their upcast countertypes are passed as constructor parameters?", "author": "abuijze", "createdAt": "2020-01-08T21:21:25Z", "path": "messaging/src/main/java/org/axonframework/serialization/upcasting/event/EventTypeUpcaster.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,109 @@\n+/*\n+ * Copyright (c) 2010-2020.
