As a result, MetaData might be\nmissed out on. This should be resolved by overriding the\ngetSnapshotSerializer/getEventSerializer methods in the\nAxonServerEventStore and by using these methods in the\nAbstractEventStorageEngine consistently. This issue only comes to light\nif snapshotFilters are used, since only then will AxonServer be\nrequested for snapshots and events separately. The latter caused a call\nwhich doesn't use this specific serializer\n\n#1611", "committedDate": "2020-11-19T15:17:40Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "306fa819cb42f391ef1d755264147f822f87e986", "url": "https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/commit/306fa819cb42f391ef1d755264147f822f87e986", "message": "Ignore snapshots for readEventData invocation with seqNo 0\n\nThe validation to take snapshots into account when retrieving events\nfrom Axon Server check for a seqNo > 0.
