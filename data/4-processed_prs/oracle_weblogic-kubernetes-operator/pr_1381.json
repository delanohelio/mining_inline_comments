Each entry may be accessed by one or more operator-managed nodes\n+as a read-only text file. Access can be provided across the domain, within a single cluster, or for a single server.\n+In each case, the access is configured within the `serverPod` element of the desired scope. \n+\n+For example, given\n+a ConfigMap named `my-map` with entries `key-1` and `key-2`, you can provide access to both values as separate files\n+in the same directory within the `cluster-1` cluster with the following\n+in your [domain resource](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/blob/master/docs/domains/Domain.md):\n+ \n+\n+```\n+  clusters:\n+  - clusterName: cluster-1\n+    serverPod:\n+      volumes:\n+      - name: my-volume-1\n+        configMap:\n+          name: my-map\n+          items: \n+          - key: key-1\n+            path: first\n+          - key: key-2\n+            path: second\n+      volumeMounts:\n+      - name: my-volume-1\n+        mountPath: /weblogic-operator/my\n+\n+```\n+This provides access to two files, found at paths `/weblogic-operator/my/first` and `/weblogic-operator/my/second`. \n+Both a volume and a volumeMount entry are required, and must have the same name. The name of the ConfigMap is \n+specified in the `name` field under the `configMap` entry.
