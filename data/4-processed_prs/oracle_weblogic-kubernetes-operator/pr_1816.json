It was in response to a customer query for data behind recommending Traefik only in dev or test environments. Additionally, I captured and compared txn/sec and response times numbers of Traefik and Apache. The results are documented in wiki mentioned in OWLS-83015, I didn't observe significant difference between Traefik and Apache numbers. I was not involved in original recommendation in this note and have not run stress tests with Voyager. Based on my testing, we can recommend Traefik in production.
