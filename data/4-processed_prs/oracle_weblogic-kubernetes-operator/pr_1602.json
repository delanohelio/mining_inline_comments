The WDT Discover tool will generate a WDT model yaml (metadata representation of the domain configuration)\n+and a properties file properties file which will contain a key=value for each property in the WDT model.\n+The sample has been enhanced to update the domain using both the WDT Update and the WDT Extract Domain Resource Tools.\n+\n+New functionality for the Domain Home on PV sample:\n+1- The create domain script will use the WDT Extract Domain Resource Tool to generate the domain CR yaml (domain.yaml).\n+2- The ability to update the domain on PV which was originally created as described above using WDT. The domain\n+   configuration will be updated by running WDT Update Tool using a WDT full model and the equivalent change to\n+   the Domain CR using the WDT Extract Domain Resource Tool.\n+3- The create and update domain will accept the following inputs: a WDT model, and the WDT properties file\n+    (e.g. generated during WDT discovery).\n+\n+Note: You can still create the domain by updating the create-domain-inputs yaml file.\n+\n+This sample has been modified to create a domain on PV and also to update the domain using the new WDT model.\n+The updateDomain is only to be used with domain created using WDT\n+\n+Use case - WDT can be used to discover an domain (could be on-prem). Running wdt discover\n+domain script generates a property file and a model file. The customer could then update the \n+input yaml file for operator specific inputs. \n+\n+An updateDomain.sh script has been added to the sample to update a domain as well as the domain resource if needed.\n+\n+This sample can take both the input yaml file and the generated properties file as inputs to \n+createDomain.sh and updateDomain.sh as a comma separated list.\n+\n+When introspecting an existing domain with WDT the resulting model might need to be modified for compatibility with\n+specific target environments, such as Oracle Weblogic Server Kubernetes Operator.

The domain.yaml generated by the WDT Extract Domain Resource Tool will have '--FIX ME--' statements for\n+      those values it can not generate. The user is expected to fill in the information identified by --FIX ME--\n+      in the domain resource output. Make sure the domain.yaml does not contain any '--FIX ME--' before proceeding\n+      to the next step.\n+   3. kubectl apply -f domain.yaml\n+\n+To update a domain using this sample -\n+\n+   2.
