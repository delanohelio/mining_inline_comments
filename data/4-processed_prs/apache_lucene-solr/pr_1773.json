It is an implicit handler, so you don't need to define it.\n+\n+The Luke Request Handler accepts the following parameters:\n+\n+`show`::\n+The data about the index to include in the response.  Options are `schema`, `index`, `doc`, `all`.  `index` describes the high level details about the index.  `schema` returns details about the `schema` plus the `index` data.  `doc` works in conjunction with `docId` or `id` parameters and returns details about a specific document plus the `index` data.\n+\n+`id`::\n+Get a document using the uniqueKeyField specified in schema.xml.\n+\n+`docId`::\n+Get a document using a lucene documentID.\n+\n+`fl`::\n+Which fields you want to list the top terms for.\n+\n+`numTerms`::\n+How many top terms for each field. The default is 10.\n+\n+`includeIndexFieldFlags`::\n+Choose whether /luke should return the index-flags for each field. Fetching and returning the index-flags for each field in the index has non-zero cost, and can slow down requests to /luke.\n+\n+\n+== LukeRequestHandler Examples\n+\n+The following examples assume you are running Solr's `techproducts` example configuration:\n+\n+[source,bash]\n+----\n+bin/solr start -e techproducts\n+----\n+\n+To return summary information about the index:\n+\n+[source,text]\n+ttp://localhost:8983/solr/techproducts/admin/luke?numTerms=0\n+", "originalCommit": "6c1fff8e8c30e1bc45107ba8a003396ad3a4fc71", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "8cb4e630663903dbed4a6d50c291449c1c152f24", "url": "https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/commit/8cb4e630663903dbed4a6d50c291449c1c152f24", "message": "typo and rework text", "committedDate": "2020-08-26T20:25:31Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "7621822349556a2c066a58d69978aec1feeebbcc", "url": "https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/commit/7621822349556a2c066a58d69978aec1feeebbcc", "message": "move links around", "committedDate": "2020-08-26T20:40:47Z", "type": "commit"}]}
