When we are going to delete some vector by its exact values, Lucene seems to retrieve the similar vectors and then delete all of them, which may not be the behavior we expect. The class KnnExactVectorValueWeight is the corresponding weight for KnnExactVectorValueQuery to filter the vectors that not exactly equal to the query vector in value. Therefore, the two classes are specially designed for deletion and updating. The results that KnnGraphQuery retrieved contains that retrieved by KnnExactVectorValueWeight, so there's any necessary to establish a new query (e.g. KnnExactVectorValueQuery) for ordinary query.\nI'm not pretty sure if there is any situation that we need to delete by query.
