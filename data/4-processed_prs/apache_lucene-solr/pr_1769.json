While this approach would still work, in Jan 2019 this would typically done with Docker cluster and orchestration tools like Kubernetes. See for example [this blog post](https://lucidworks.com/2019/02/07/running-solr-on-kubernetes-part-1/)._\n+\n+In this example I'll create a cluster with 3 ZooKeeper nodes and 3 Solr nodes, distributed over 3 machines (trinity10, trinity20, trinity30).\n+I'll use an overlay network, specify fixed IP addresses when creating containers, and I'll pass in explicit `/etc/hosts` entries to make sure they are available even when nodes are down.\n+I won't show the configuration of the key-value store to configuration to enable networking, see [the docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/get-started-overlay/) for that.\n+I'll not use Docker Swarm in this example, but specifically place and configure containers where I want them by ssh'ing into the appropriate Docker host.\n+\n+To make this example easier to understand I'll just use shell commands.\n+For actual use you may want to use a fancier deployment tool like [Fabric](http://www.fabfile.org).\n+\n+Note: this example requires Docker 1.10.\n+\n+I'll run these commands from the first machine, trinity10.\n+\n+Create a network named \"netzksolr\" for this cluster. The `--ip-range` specifies the range of\n+addresses to use for containers, whereas the `--subnet` specifies all possible addresses in this\n+network. So effectively, addresses in the subnet but outside the range are reserved for containers\n+that specifically use the `--ip` option.\n+\n+```\n+docker network create --driver=overlay --subnet 192.168.22.0/24 --ip-range=192.168.22.128/25 netzksolr\n+```\n+\n+As a simple test, check the automatic assignment and specific assignment work:\n+\n+```\n+mak@trinity10:~$ docker run -i --rm --net=netzksolr busybox ip -4 addr show eth0 | grep inet", "originalCommit": "901162da8e71250ab75159262b5373caeea9c2af", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ3OTY0MDMzNA==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/pull/1769#discussion_r479640334", "bodyText": "Hi,\nas noted on Slack already.

The same is true for\n+changes to configuration files.\n+\n+Equally, if you `docker commit` your container, you can later create a new\n+container from that image, and that will have your data in it.\n+\n+For some use-cases it is convenient to provide a modified `solr.in.sh` file to Solr.\n+For example to point Solr to a ZooKeeper host:\n+\n+```\n+docker create --name my_solr -P solr\n+docker cp my_solr:/opt/solr/bin/solr.in.sh .\n+sed -i -e 's/#ZK_HOST=.*/ZK_HOST=cylon.lan:2181/' solr.in.sh\n+docker cp solr.in.sh my_solr:/opt/solr/bin/solr.in.sh\n+docker start my_solr\n+# With a browser go to http://cylon.lan:32873/solr/#/ and confirm \"-DzkHost=cylon.lan:2181\" in the JVM Args section.\n+```\n+\n+But usually when people ask this question, what they are after is a way\n+to store Solr data and config in a separate [Docker Volume](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockervolumes/).\n+That is explained in the next two questions.\n+\n+\n+How can I mount a host directory as a data volume?\n+--------------------------------------------------\n+\n+This is useful if you want to inspect or modify the data in the Docker host\n+when the container is not running, and later easily run new containers against that data.\n+This is indeed possible, but there are a few gotchas.\n+\n+Solr stores its core data in the `server/solr` directory, in sub-directories\n+for each core. The `server/solr` directory also contains configuration files\n+that are part of the Solr distribution.\n+Now, if we mounted volumes for each core individually, then that would\n+interfere with Solr trying to create those directories. If instead we make\n+the whole directory a volume, then we need to provide those configuration files\n+in our volume, which we can do by copying them from a temporary container.\n+For example:\n+\n+```\n+# create a directory to store the server/solr directory\n+$ mkdir /home/docker-volumes/mysolr1\n+\n+# make sure its host owner matches the container's solr user\n+$ sudo chown 8983:8983 /home/docker-volumes/mysolr1\n+\n+# copy the solr directory from a temporary container to the volume\n+$ docker run -it --rm -v /home/docker-volumes/mysolr1:/target apache/solr cp -r server/solr /target/\n+\n+# pass the solr directory to a new container running solr\n+$ SOLR_CONTAINER=$(docker run -d -P -v /home/docker-volumes/mysolr1/solr:/opt/solr/server/solr apache/solr)\n+\n+# create a new core\n+$ docker exec -it --user=solr $SOLR_CONTAINER solr create_core -c gettingstarted\n+\n+# check the volume on the host:\n+$ ls /home/docker-volumes/mysolr1/solr/\n+configsets  gettingstarted  README.txt  solr.xml  zoo.cfg\n+```\n+\n+Note that if you add or modify files in that directory from the host, you must `chown 8983:8983` them.\n+\n+\n+How can I use a Data Volume Container?\n+--------------------------------------\n+\n+You can avoid the concerns about UID mismatches above, by using data volumes only from containers.\n+You can create a container with a volume, then point future containers at that same volume.\n+This can be handy if you want to modify the solr image, for example if you want to add a program.\n+By separating the data and the code, you can change the code and re-use the data.\n+\n+But there are pitfalls:\n+\n+- if you remove the container that owns the volume, then you lose your data.\n+  Docker does not even warn you that a running container is dependent on it.\n+- if you point multiple solr containers at the same volume, you will have multiple instances\n+  write to the same files, which will undoubtedly lead to corruption\n+- if you do want to remove that volume, you must do `docker rm -v containername`;\n+  if you forget the `-v` there will be a dangling volume which you can not easily clean up.\n+\n+Here is an example:\n+\n+```\n+# create a container with a volume on the path that solr uses to store data.\n+docker create -v /opt/solr/server/solr --name mysolr1data solr /bin/true\n+\n+# pass the volume to a new container running solr\n+SOLR_CONTAINER=$(docker run -d -P --volumes-from=mysolr1data apache/solr)\n+\n+# create a new core\n+$ docker exec -it --user=solr $SOLR_CONTAINER solr create_core -c gettingstarted\n+\n+# make a change to the config, using the config API\n+docker exec -it --user=solr $SOLR_CONTAINER curl http://localhost:8983/solr/gettingstarted/config -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d'{\n+    \"set-property\" : {\"query.filterCache.autowarmCount\":1000},\n+    \"unset-property\" :\"query.filterCache.size\"}'\n+\n+# verify the change took effect\n+docker exec -it --user=solr $SOLR_CONTAINER curl http://localhost:8983/solr/gettingstarted/config/overlay?omitHeader=true\n+\n+# stop the solr container\n+docker exec -it --user=solr $SOLR_CONTAINER bash -c 'cd server; java -DSTOP.PORT=7983 -DSTOP.KEY=solrrocks -jar start.jar --stop'\n+\n+# create a new container\n+SOLR_CONTAINER=$(docker run -d -P --volumes-from=mysolr1data apache/solr)\n+\n+# check our core is still there:\n+docker exec -it --user=solr $SOLR_CONTAINER ls server/solr/gettingstarted\n+\n+# check the config modification is still there:\n+docker exec -it --user=solr $SOLR_CONTAINER curl http://localhost:8983/solr/gettingstarted/config/overlay?omitHeader=true\n+```\n+\n+\n+Can I use volumes with SOLR_HOME?\n+---------------------------------\n+\n+Solr supports a SOLR_HOME environment variable to point to a non-standard location of the Solr home directory.\n+You can use this in Solr docker, in combination with volumes:\n+\n+```\n+docker run -it -v $PWD/mysolrhome:/mysolrhome -e SOLR_HOME=/mysolrhome apache/solr\n+```\n+\n+This does need a pre-configured directory at that location.\n+\n+To make this easier, Solr docker supports a INIT_SOLR_HOME setting, which copies the contents\n+from the default directory in the image to the SOLR_HOME (if it is empty).\n+\n+```\n+mkdir mysolrhome\n+sudo chown 8983:8983 mysolrhome\n+docker run -it -v $PWD/mysolrhome:/mysolrhome -e SOLR_HOME=/mysolrhome -e INIT_SOLR_HOME=yes apache/solr\n+```\n+\n+Note: If SOLR_HOME is set, the \"solr-precreate\" command will put the created core in the SOLR_HOME directory\n+rather than the \"mycores\" directory.\n+\n+\n+Can I run ZooKeeper and Solr clusters under Docker?\n+---------------------------------------------------\n+\n+At the network level the ZooKeeper nodes need to be able to talk to eachother,\n+and the Solr nodes need to be able to talk to the ZooKeeper nodes and to each other.\n+At the application level, different nodes need to be able to identify and locate each other.\n+In ZooKeeper that is done with a configuration file that lists hostnames or IP addresses for each node.\n+In Solr that is done with a parameter that specifies a host or IP address, which is then stored in ZooKeeper.\n+\n+In typical clusters, those hostnames/IP addresses are pre-defined and remain static through the lifetime of the cluster.\n+In Docker, inter-container communication and multi-host networking can be facilitated by [Docker Networks](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/).\n+But, crucially, Docker does not normally guarantee that IP addresses of containers remain static during the lifetime of a container.\n+In non-networked Docker, the IP address seems to change everytime you stop/start.\n+In a networked Docker, containers can lose their IP address in certain sequences of starting/stopping, unless you take steps to prevent that.\n+\n+IP changes causes problems:\n+\n+- If you use hardcoded IP addresses in configuration, and the addresses of your containers change after a stops/start, then your cluster will stop working and may corrupt itself.\n+- If you use hostnames in configuration, and the addresses of your containers change, then you might run into problems with cached hostname lookups.\n+- And if you use hostnames there is another problem: the names are not defined until the respective container is running,\n+So when for example the first ZooKeeper node starts up, it will attempt a hostname lookup for the other nodes, and that will fail.\n+This is especially a problem for ZooKeeper 3.4.6; future versions are better at recovering.\n+\n+Docker 1.10 has a new `--ip` configuration option that allows you to specify an IP address for a container.\n+It also has a `--ip-range` option that allows you to specify the range that other containers get addresses from.\n+Used together, you can implement static addresses. See [this example](docs/docker-networking.md).\n+\n+\n+Can I run ZooKeeper and Solr with Docker Links?\n+-----------------------------------------------\n+\n+Docker's [Legacy container links](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/default_network/dockerlinks/) provide a way to\n+pass connection configuration between containers. It only works on a single machine, on the default bridge.\n+It provides no facilities for static IPs.\n+Note: this feature is expected to be deprecated and removed in a future release.\n+So really, see the \"Can I run ZooKeeper and Solr clusters under Docker?\" option above instead.\n+\n+But for some use-cases, such as quick demos or one-shot automated testing, it can be convenient.\n+\n+Run ZooKeeper, and define a name so we can link to it:\n+\n+```console\n+$ docker run --name zookeeper -d -p 2181:2181 -p 2888:2888 -p 3888:3888 jplock/zookeeper\n+```\n+\n+Run two Solr nodes, linked to the zookeeper container:\n+\n+```console\n+$ docker run --name solr1 --link zookeeper:ZK -d -p 8983:8983 \\\n+      apache/solr \\\n+      bash -c 'solr start -f -z $ZK_PORT_2181_TCP_ADDR:$ZK_PORT_2181_TCP_PORT'\n+\n+$ docker run --name solr2 --link zookeeper:ZK -d -p 8984:8983 \\\n+      apache/solr \\\n+      bash -c 'solr start -f -z $ZK_PORT_2181_TCP_ADDR:$ZK_PORT_2181_TCP_PORT'\n+```\n+\n+Create a collection:\n+\n+```console\n+$ docker exec -i -t solr1 solr create_collection \\\n+        -c gettingstarted -shards 2 -p 8983\n+```\n+\n+Then go to `http://localhost:8983/solr/#/~cloud` (adjust the hostname for your docker host) to see the two shards and Solr nodes.\n+\n+\n+How can I run ZooKeeper and Solr with Docker Compose?\n+-----------------------------------------------------\n+\n+See the [docker compose example](docs/docker-compose.yml).\n+\n+\n+I'm confused about the different invocations of solr -- help?\n+-------------------------------------------------------------\n+\n+The different invocations of the Solr docker image can look confusing, because the name of the\n+image is \"solr\" and the Solr command is also \"solr\", and the image interprets various arguments in", "originalCommit": "386552bf0141438e0edc3b3d0c6802dbdc6eb5f3", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "f7ee6942260e1ac774dec82eec7ff25b33c76e3f", "url": "https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/commit/f7ee6942260e1ac774dec82eec7ff25b33c76e3f", "message": "Change package dockerfile to use scratch.", "committedDate": "2020-09-11T15:25:44Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "352f20bf20113a9c93d6c4db807731bcebfdc51c", "url": "https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/commit/352f20bf20113a9c93d6c4db807731bcebfdc51c", "message": "Move docker gradle plugin version to base build.gradle", "committedDate": "2020-09-11T15:26:16Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "03b03063a1052a47d219c6b98bcfe9fda0944918", "url": "https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/commit/03b03063a1052a47d219c6b98bcfe9fda0944918", "message": "Adding mike to CHANGES.txt", "committedDate": "2020-09-11T15:30:59Z", "type": "commit"}]}
