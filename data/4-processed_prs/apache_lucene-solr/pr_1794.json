That's a general principle. But, the reality is people will look for it and may be lost when they don't find it.\nI don't have an ideal solution generally, but in this case I coincidentally happen to be planning a mass re-org of the entire Ref Guide (SOLR-14444) for 9.0. One of the things I'm considering is to consolidate the content of some pages which will remove some. Other pages I intend to rename. So, I'll need to find an answer to the problem. I'm keeping track of these changes in a spreadsheet, in case we need it for however we choose to handle it.
