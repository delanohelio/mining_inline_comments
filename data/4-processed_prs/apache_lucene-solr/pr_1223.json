That statement is incomplete. It is that plus the CoreContainer#sharedStoreManager is initialized because CorePullerFeeder depends on that. Also blobCoreSyncer and blobProcessUtil are two fields that are not initialized yet. The comment suggests all the public facing fields would have been initialized by now. Even if that is not what the comment means, there is nothing preventing them from being accessed in null state.\nThe other problem is that if the CoreContainer#load fails then CoreContainer@shutdown is called for cleanup. At least inside CoreContainer#createAndLoad. That can hit an NPE when calling sharedStoreManager.getBlobProcessManager().shutdown() because it is possible the exception that started the shutdown was in sharedStoreManager#load before blobProcessUtil was even initialized.\nThe second problem can be solved by creating a shutdown method inside SharedStoreManager and moving  sharedStoreManager.getBlobProcessManager().shutdown() there, protected by blobProcessUtil!= null check.\nThough, I don't have any good ideas for the first problem.", "author": "mbwaheed", "createdAt": "2020-02-20T02:18:44Z", "path": "solr/core/src/java/org/apache/solr/store/shared/SharedStoreManager.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -43,68 +43,38 @@\n \n   public SharedStoreManager(ZkController controller) {\n     zkController = controller;\n-    // initialize BlobProcessUtil with the SharedStoreManager for background processes to be ready\n-    blobProcessUtil = new BlobProcessUtil(zkController.getCoreContainer());\n-    blobCoreSyncer = new BlobCoreSyncer();\n-    sharedCoreConcurrencyController = new SharedCoreConcurrencyController(zkController.getCoreContainer());\n-  }\n-  \n-  @VisibleForTesting\n-  public void initBlobStorageProvider(BlobStorageProvider blobStorageProvider) {\n-    this.blobStorageProvider = blobStorageProvider;\n-  }\n-  \n-  @VisibleForTesting\n-  public void initBlobProcessUtil(BlobProcessUtil processUtil) {\n-    if (blobProcessUtil != null) {\n-      blobProcessUtil.shutdown();\n-    }\n-    blobProcessUtil = processUtil;\n+    blobStorageProvider = new BlobStorageProvider();\n+    blobDeleteManager = new BlobDeleteManager(getBlobStorageProvider().getClient());\n+    corePullTracker = new CorePullTracker();\n+    sharedShardMetadataController = new SharedShardMetadataController(zkController.getSolrCloudManager());\n+    sharedCoreConcurrencyController = new SharedCoreConcurrencyController(sharedShardMetadataController);\n   }\n   \n-  /*\n-   * Initiates a SharedShardMetadataController if it doesn't exist and returns one \n+  /**\n+   * Start blob processes that depend on an initiated SharedStoreManager\n    */\n+  public void load() {\n+    blobCoreSyncer = new BlobCoreSyncer();", "originalCommit": "94e59d3740d2d9aa2f22ac28ec2a9ac7f84d3cab", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4MzU0ODg4MQ==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/pull/1223#discussion_r383548881", "bodyText": "For the first problem, there are shared storage components that have corecontainer injected explicitly in their api methods or via other dependencies that have getters opening access to it (zkcontroller for example).
