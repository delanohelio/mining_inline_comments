Is that correct?\n\nYeah I think that sums it up - and yes the result is sorted by subject (this is specified in the actual reindex query). This code is pretty old, and I agree that there are likely far more efficient ways to trigger a reindexing.\n\nI'm not proposing that we need to actually rewrite the code.\n\nWorth logging an issue for? The problem is that none of us have LuceneSail maintenance/improvements high on our priority list.\n\nCould you check that !statements.empty() as well, so we don't add the last document twice?\n\nGood point.
