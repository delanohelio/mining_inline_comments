Or will it just crash with a ClassNotFoundException? Don't bother if this is a massive effort but if we can do a simple check and have a fallback that (no matter how ineffecient) at least works, it makes the \"optional\" story a bit more convincing :)", "author": "jeenbroekstra", "createdAt": "2020-03-23T22:13:25Z", "path": "core/sail/extensible-store/pom.xml", "diffHunk": "@@ -46,7 +46,9 @@\n                     <groupId>org.asynchttpclient</groupId>\n                 </exclusion>\n             </exclusions>\n-        </dependency>\n+\t\t\t<scope>provided</scope>", "originalCommit": "2fc4501d275622230287e461cf1b6a9606b89b6b", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5OTE1NDM4Mg==", "url": "https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/pull/2036#discussion_r399154382", "bodyText": "Changed it to optional.", "author": "hmottestad", "createdAt": "2020-03-27T10:03:16Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5Njc4ODI3Ng=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "091157d4fa61073ab70c36b1046531c8cd169e84", "url": "https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/commit/091157d4fa61073ab70c36b1046531c8cd169e84", "message": "Update pom.xml", "committedDate": "2020-03-26T15:11:46Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "89717533a52a817acf4e4588fcb3a7afda2ff273", "url": "https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/commit/89717533a52a817acf4e4588fcb3a7afda2ff273", "message": "GH-1784 make ElasticsearchStore run without HLL dependency\n\nSigned-off-by: Ha\u030avard Ottestad <hmottestad@gmail.com>", "committedDate": "2020-03-27T08:56:32Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "ce40cc8482d286a3fef1af6b3f9d31b0e8ef9874", "url": "https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/commit/ce40cc8482d286a3fef1af6b3f9d31b0e8ef9874", "message": "GH-1784 formatted pom files with xml formatter\n\nSigned-off-by: Ha\u030avard Ottestad <hmottestad@gmail.com>", "committedDate": "2020-03-27T09:42:22Z", "type": "commit"}]}
