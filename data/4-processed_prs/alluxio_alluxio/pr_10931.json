It should also include any non-goals of the design which would be expected from a reader. This also includes some high level functionality or performance gains.\n+\n+##\tUse Cases\n+This section explains the use cases which will be enabled by the implementation of this design. This section should be from the perspective of a user and how they would be able to interact with the feature described.\n+\n+##\tDesign\n+This section explains the high level changes proposed to achieve the design. Changes should be grouped by project components or in another logical way which makes the design easy to follow.\n+If applicable, the design should be broken down into separate phases which each delivers incremental value. The first phase should achieve the minimum requirements outlined in the goals.\n+If applicable, alternative approaches should be noted and evaluated for different sections of the design.\n+\n+##\tAPI Changes\n+This is a section detailing any user facing or internal APIs added to components, including configuration changes. Any changes to user facing components are mentioned here (ie. WebUI, command line). If no changes are made, it should be stated in this section.\n+Changes should be formatted in a reader friendly manner. A one-cell table should be used to contain the code blocks and monospace font should be used when writing code.\n+\n+##\tCompatibility\n+This section explains any compatibility assumptions or limitations. This should apply to compatibility between versions and editions. For designs which affect both enterprise and open source, this section should call out any significant deviations and strategies to avoid divergence as well as the separation between open source and closed source.\n+This section also analyzes any dependency changes (ie. pom file changes). In particular, the addition of new external libraries should be justified.\n+\n+##\tSecurity\n+This section explains any security considerations which must be taken into account. If there are no security implications, it should be stated explicitly here.\n+\n+##\tImplementation Detail (Optional)\n+This is an OPTIONAL and possibly REPEATED section which dives into a specific implementation detail in the design. Diagrams, code snippets, and other figures are encouraged.\n+\n+##\tFailure Analysis\n+This section explains the various failure cases which the design must tolerate as well as failure cases the design neglects to address. Each failure should be noted with the expected behavior as well as ideal behavior, and if different, what effort is required to bridge the gap.\n+This section should also outline any potential risks due to the implementation of this design such as performance loss, undesired behavior, and system instability.\n+\n+##\tTest Plan\n+This section details the tests which will be added to ensure the quality and maintainability of the implementation. Unit tests should be added under the corresponding Alluxio module. Integration tests should be added to alluxio/tests module. System tests performed manually can be mentioned in the PR.

The reviewers (assignees on the corresponding Github issue or the reviewers of the pull request) will review\n+the feature design document and provide feedback or request for iterations.\n+Please feel free to raise questions and seek help from the reviewers and community members, \n+if you are uncertain about specific design decisions. \n+Please also list options for the feature and corresponding pros and cons.\n+1. After a few iterations on the design document, reviewers will give an **LGTM** to the design document.\n+And this feature can move on to the implementation phase.\n+1. Fork Alluxio repository, implement your feature and create a pull request, \n+as you have mastered in the previous section. Please also link to the issue and design document in your pull request.\n+1. After your pull request is reviewed and merged, you have contributed your feature to Alluxio. Cheers!\n+1.
