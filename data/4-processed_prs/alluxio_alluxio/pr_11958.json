Note that although the number of potential concurrent clients are high, it is\n+unlikely for all clients to simultaneously hit the master. The steady state number of concurrent\n+clients to the master is generally much lower.\n+\n+The number of concurrent clients to the master impacts the following\n+* Number of cores required by the master - We recommend 8 clients per core, or to determine the\n+number of cores based on required operation throughput.\n+* Number of open files allowed on the master - We recommend about 4 open files per expected\n+concurrent client. On Linux machines this can be set by modifying `/etc/security/limits.d` and\n+checked with the `ulimit` command.\n+\n+### Worker", "originalCommit": "83680b1eb69f04c6ea908cdf193ed1d5767bbeed", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2OTM4OTQzNw==", "url": "https://github.com/Alluxio/alluxio/pull/11958#discussion_r469389437", "bodyText": "Updated to ####, thanks.", "author": "calvinjia", "createdAt": "2020-08-12T16:31:17Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2ODk1MDk3MA=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "cbf917c37e32427efb332eb7e9c80dcdc9051ec3", "url": "https://github.com/Alluxio/alluxio/commit/cbf917c37e32427efb332eb7e9c80dcdc9051ec3", "message": "Address comments.", "committedDate": "2020-08-12T16:30:38Z", "type": "commit"}]}
