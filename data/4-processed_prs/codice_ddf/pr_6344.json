Also, we decided to keep maintaining both here (rather than just use the cfg-style in the itests) because there was some karaf console bug with the xml-style config, which make the cfg-style config preferable for devs who don't need to harden. Lastly, there was a bug with the failover appender that made it so that we needed to use the xml-style if you wanted failover logging, which is part of hardening. These issues might have been fixed since I last worked with these files, but iirc, those were the motivations for this decision.\n\n  \n    \n      ddf/distribution/ddf-common/src/main/resources/etc/org.ops4j.pax.logging.cfg\n    \n    \n        Lines 20 to 24\n      in\n      bfbd3b4\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n        \n          \n           # In order to switch to the xml-style configuration for Log4j2 in ${karaf.etc}/log4j2.xml, \n        \n\n        \n          \n           # uncomment the following line and remove all the configuration beneath it.
