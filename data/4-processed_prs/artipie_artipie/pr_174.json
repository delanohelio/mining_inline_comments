I think, it's better if the Pie class will know about repositories and the paths they handled. Then we will be able to introduces the changes in the single place. Currently, we have 2 path-related issues:\n\nIn generally we handles flat repositories structure only (repo path is always single-level). It is bad for the case of personal repos in central.artipie.com - we need to use user-repo-name naming policy instead of more suitable user/repo-name. Single-level path requirement is the strange restriction and I'm not sure that we shall to handle it;\nMany of our adapters contain tests for the case when no context path exists at all and the repo handles root path (this case is impossible in our runtime).\n\nI think, it's better to do the following:\n\nremove all paths from repo configs (not only NPM adapters containt it);\npass actual repo path from Pie to SliceFromConfig and use it in adapter's constructor if they need this information.\n\nBut I think that this refactoring should be done as separate set of issues.\nIf you want, I can remove the path from here and will be always use the first part of URL, but it looks like that we are changing one temporary solution to another", "author": "brastak", "createdAt": "2020-05-27T09:42:24Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzMDg3OTk3Mg=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzMTAxMDU0OA==", "url": "https://github.com/artipie/artipie/pull/174#discussion_r431010548", "bodyText": "@brastak yes, it sounds reasonable.
