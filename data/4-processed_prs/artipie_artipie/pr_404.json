I believe that buffering ans synchronizing writes is mandatory here from the start.\nWhat do you think about collecting data to InMemoryMetrics and publishing it periodically to Storage approximately the same way we publish it to log? That way we have buffering and synchronized writes.", "author": "olegmoz", "createdAt": "2020-07-30T08:28:43Z", "path": "src/main/java/com/artipie/metrics/asto/StorageMetrics.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,148 @@\n+/*\n+ * The MIT License (MIT)\n+ *\n+ * Copyright (c) 2020 artipie.com\n+ *\n+ * Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\n+ * of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\n+ * in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\n+ * to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\n+ * copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\n+ * furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n+ *\n+ * The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\n+ * in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n+ *\n+ * THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\n+ * IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n+ * FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
