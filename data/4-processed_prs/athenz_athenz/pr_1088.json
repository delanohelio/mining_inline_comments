Everything seems in order\nLocked flatpicker on version 4.6.3. It got upgraded to 4.6.6 without it and it apparently changes the name of some CSS classes (remove the fp- at the start of it) which caused snapshot tests to fail (although visually I didn't notice any difference).", "author": "OferLevi85", "createdAt": "2020-08-19T12:11:36Z", "path": "ui/package.json", "diffHunk": "@@ -58,10 +58,10 @@\n         \"emotion\": \"^10.0.27\",\n         \"express\": \"^4.16.4\",\n         \"fetchr\": \"^0.5.38\",\n-        \"flatpickr\": \"^4.6.3\",\n+        \"flatpickr\": \"4.6.3\",", "originalCommit": "de0f99ebcbbb66bcc05c0264e200138c7d5dabb8", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}]}
