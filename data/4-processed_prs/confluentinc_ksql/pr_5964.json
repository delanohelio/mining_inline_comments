The existing dependency is I believe between the ksqldb-functional-tests test scope and the ksqldb-engine test scope.\nI think TestExecutor as well as possibly some other things under ksqldb-functional-tests/src/main/java/io/confluent/ksql/test (e.g. TestFunctionRegistry) would have to be moved to the testing scope -- unless there's a way to make the ksqldb-functional-tests main scope depend on ksqldb-engine test scope?  It's kind of a weird thing since even the main scope of ksqldb-functional-tests is related to testing ksql, but it's seemingly more tooling than unit tests.\nSo maybe things are actually in a reasonable place where they are? And if not, this refactoring seems like it would be bigger and belong in a followup.
