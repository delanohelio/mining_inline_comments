The\n+following describes how to configure listeners depending on the nature of your environment and\n+requirements.\n \n-### Listener Uses a Routable IP Address\n+### Single listener\n \n-If you want to configure your listener with an expicit IP address that is reachable\n-within the cluster, you might do the following:\n+#### Single routable listener\n+\n+If you want to configure your listener with an IP address or hostname that is resolvable and\n+routable from within the cluster, you might do the following:\n \n ```properties\n-listeners=http://192.168.1.101:8088\n+# Hostname that other nodes can resolve to an routable IP:\n+listeners=https://ksqlHost56:8088\n+\n+# Or, routable IP address:\n+listeners=https://192.168.1.101:8088\n ```\n \n-This listener will bind the client and internal endpoints to the given address, which\n-will also be utilized by inter-node communication.\n+In this setup, the node will share the first url in the `listeners` config as its internal\n+endpoint, which other nodes will use for inter-node communication. Inter-node communication will\n+use the same listener as client communication.\n+\n+#### Single non-routable listener\n \n-### Listener Uses a Special or Unroutable Address\n+It's common to setup a service using special hostnames such as `localhost` or wildcard addresses\n+such as `0.0.0.0` or `[::]`. These have special meanings and are not appropriate for\n+inter-node communication, as they are not routable from other machines. Similarly, if your\n+network is setup such that the IP or hostname you bind isn't resolvable or routable.\n \n-It's common to setup a service using special hostnames such as `localhost` or special\n-addresses such as `0.0.0.0`.  Both have special meanings and are not appropriate for\n-inter-node commmunication.  Similarly, if your network is setup such that the IP you\n-bind isn't routeable, it's also not appropriate.  If you choose to use such a listener,\n-you must set `ksql.advertised.listener` specifying which address to use:\n+If you choose to use a non-routable listener, you must set `ksql.advertised.listener`, specifying a\n+url that is externally accessible and which will resolve to an endpoint defined in `listeners`.\n \n ```properties\n+# Non-routable wildcard ip:\n listeners=http://0.0.0.0:8088\n+\n+# External accessible name that will resolve to the IP of the machine:\n ksql.advertised.listener=http://host1.internal.example.com:8088\n ```\n \n-This listener will bind the client and internal endpoints to the given address.  Now\n-inter-node communication will explicity use the other address \n-`http://host1.internal.example.com:8088`.\n+In this setup, the node will share the url in the `ksql.advertised.listener` config as its\n+internal endpoint, which other nodes will use for inter-node communication. Inter-node\n+communication will use the same listener as client communication.\n+\n+### Dual listeners\n \n-### Listener Binds Client and Internal Listeners Separately\n+You may choose to configure internal communication to use a different listener to client\n+ommunication, which allows for port filtering rules to deny clients access the internal listener, or\n+the use of a different network interface for internal communication, for security or QoS reasons.\n \n-If ksqlDB is being run in an environment where you require more security, you first\n-want to enable [authentication and other security measures](security.md).  Secondly,\n-you may choose to configure internal endpoints to be bound using a separate listener\n-from the client endpoints. This allows for port filtering, to make internal endpoints\n-unreachable beyond the internal network of the cluster, based on the port bound.\n-Similarly, it allows for the use of dual network interfaces where one is public facing,\n-and the other is cluster facing.  Both measures can used to add additional security to\n-your configuration.  To do this, you can set a separate listener for inter-node\n-communication `ksql.internal.listener`:\n+This can be achieved by setting the `ksql.internal.listener` configuration to start a second\n+listener that will exclusively used for inter-node communication.\n+\n+If running dual listeners to improve security, you may also wish to enable\n+[authentication and other security measures](security.md).\n+\n+#### Dual routable listeners\n+\n+Where the internal IP or hostname used in the `ksql.internal.listener` configuration is externally\n+resolvable and routable, only `ksql.internal.listener` needs to configured to set the internal\n+listener, for example:\n \n ```properties\n+# Client listener:\n listeners=https://192.168.1.101:8088\n-# Port 8099 is available only to the trusted internal network\n-ksql.internal.listener=https://192.168.1.101:8099\n+\n+# Inter-node listener on different NIC:\n+ksql.internal.listener=https://192.168.1.102:8088\n ```\n \n-Now, `listener` will bind the client endpoints, while `ksql.internal.listener` binds\n-the internal ones.  Also, inter-node communication will now utilize the addess from \n-`ksql.internal.listener`.\n+!!! note\n+    Only the `ksql.internal.listener` needs to be resolvable and routable from servers running other\n+    nodes in the cluster. The `listener` configuration can be non-resolvable and non-routable, as\n+    clients' can connect using whatever url you choose.\n \n+In this setup, the node will share the url in the `ksql.internal.listener` config as its\n+internal endpoint, which other nodes will use for inter-node communication. Inter-node\n+communication will use a different listener to client communication.\n \n-### Listener Binds Client and Internal Listeners Separately With Special Addresses\n+#### Dual non-routable listeners\n \n-This combines two of the previous configurations:\n+Where the internal IP or hostname used in the `ksql.internal.listener` configuration is not", "originalCommit": "0eb209aa89be0702e9ffc7bdd81516ad537af353", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyNTg3NTQ4NQ==", "url": "https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/pull/5373#discussion_r425875485", "bodyText": "Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n            `0.0.0.0` or `[::]`, both `ksql.internal.listener` and `ksql.advertised.listener` need to configured\n          \n          \n            \n            `0.0.0.0` or `[::]`, you must configure both `ksql.internal.listener` and `ksql.advertised.listener`", "author": "JimGalasyn", "createdAt": "2020-05-15T15:22:13Z", "path": "docs/operate-and-deploy/installation/server-config/index.md", "diffHunk": "@@ -310,83 +310,126 @@ Start the ksqlDB server with the configuration file specified.\n <path-to-confluent>/bin/ksql-server-start <path-to-confluent>/etc/ksqldb/ksql-server.properties\n ```\n \n-Configuring Listeners for a ksqlDB Cluster\n---------------------------------\n+Configuring Listeners of a ksqlDB Cluster\n+------------------------------------------\n \n Multiple hosts are required to scale ksqlDB processing power and to do that, they must\n form a cluster.  ksqlDB requires all hosts of a cluster to use the same `ksql.service.id`.\n \n ```properties\n-bootstrap.servers=localhost:9092\n+bootstrap.servers=kafkaBroker1:9092,kafkaBroker2:9092\n ksql.service.id=my_application_\n ```\n \n Once formed, many operations can be run using the client APIs exposed on `listeners`.\n \n-In order to utilize pull queries and their high availability functionality,\n-the hosts within the cluster must be configured to speak to each other via their\n-internal endpoints.

If you choose to use such a listener,\n-you must set `ksql.advertised.listener` specifying which address to use:\n+If you choose to use a non-routable listener, you must set `ksql.advertised.listener`, specifying a\n+url that is externally accessible and which will resolve to an endpoint defined in `listeners`.\n \n ```properties\n+# Non-routable wildcard ip:\n listeners=http://0.0.0.0:8088\n+\n+# External accessible name that will resolve to the IP of the machine:\n ksql.advertised.listener=http://host1.internal.example.com:8088\n ```\n \n-This listener will bind the client and internal endpoints to the given address.  Now\n-inter-node communication will explicity use the other address \n-`http://host1.internal.example.com:8088`.\n+In this setup, the node will share the url in the `ksql.advertised.listener` config as its\n+internal endpoint, which other nodes will use for inter-node communication. Inter-node\n+communication will use the same listener as client communication.\n+\n+### Dual listeners\n \n-### Listener Binds Client and Internal Listeners Separately\n+You may choose to configure internal communication to use a different listener to client\n+ommunication, which allows for port filtering rules to deny clients access the internal listener, or\n+the use of a different network interface for internal communication, for security or QoS reasons.\n \n-If ksqlDB is being run in an environment where you require more security, you first\n-want to enable [authentication and other security measures](security.md).  Secondly,\n-you may choose to configure internal endpoints to be bound using a separate listener\n-from the client endpoints. This allows for port filtering, to make internal endpoints\n-unreachable beyond the internal network of the cluster, based on the port bound.\n-Similarly, it allows for the use of dual network interfaces where one is public facing,\n-and the other is cluster facing.  Both measures can used to add additional security to\n-your configuration.  To do this, you can set a separate listener for inter-node\n-communication `ksql.internal.listener`:\n+This can be achieved by setting the `ksql.internal.listener` configuration to start a second\n+listener that will exclusively used for inter-node communication.\n+\n+If running dual listeners to improve security, you may also wish to enable\n+[authentication and other security measures](security.md).\n+\n+#### Dual routable listeners\n+\n+Where the internal IP or hostname used in the `ksql.internal.listener` configuration is externally\n+resolvable and routable, only `ksql.internal.listener` needs to configured to set the internal\n+listener, for example:\n \n ```properties\n+# Client listener:\n listeners=https://192.168.1.101:8088\n-# Port 8099 is available only to the trusted internal network\n-ksql.internal.listener=https://192.168.1.101:8099\n+\n+# Inter-node listener on different NIC:\n+ksql.internal.listener=https://192.168.1.102:8088\n ```\n \n-Now, `listener` will bind the client endpoints, while `ksql.internal.listener` binds\n-the internal ones.  Also, inter-node communication will now utilize the addess from \n-`ksql.internal.listener`.\n+!!! note\n+    Only the `ksql.internal.listener` needs to be resolvable and routable from servers running other\n+    nodes in the cluster. The `listener` configuration can be non-resolvable and non-routable, as\n+    clients' can connect using whatever url you choose.\n \n+In this setup, the node will share the url in the `ksql.internal.listener` config as its\n+internal endpoint, which other nodes will use for inter-node communication. Inter-node\n+communication will use a different listener to client communication.\n \n-### Listener Binds Client and Internal Listeners Separately With Special Addresses\n+#### Dual non-routable listeners\n \n-This combines two of the previous configurations:\n+Where the internal IP or hostname used in the `ksql.internal.listener` configuration is not\n+externally resolvable and routable, for example where it uses `localhost` or wildcard IPs such as\n+`0.0.0.0` or `[::]`, both `ksql.internal.listener` and `ksql.advertised.listener` need to configured\n+to set the internal listener:\n \n ```properties\n+# Client listener:\n listeners=https://0.0.0.0:8088\n-# Port 8099 is available only to the trusted internal network\n+\n+# Inter-node listener on wildcard address and different port:\n+# Note: port 8099 could be locked down using port forward or other network tools.\n ksql.internal.listener=https://0.0.0.0:8099\n+\n+# Url that other nodes can resolve and use to route requests to this node:\n ksql.advertised.listener=http://host1.internal.example.com:8099\n ```\n+\n+!!! note\n+    Only the `ksql.advertised.listener` needs to be resolvable and routable from servers running\n+    other nodes in the cluster. The `listener` configuration can be non-resolvable and non-routable,\n+    as clients' can connect using whatever url you choose, and `ksql.internal.listener` is only used\n+    to start the listener.\n+\n+In this setup, the node will share the url in the `ksql.advertised.listener` config as its\n+internal endpoint, which other nodes will use for inter-node communication. Inter-node\n+communication will use a different listener to client communication.", "originalCommit": "0eb209aa89be0702e9ffc7bdd81516ad537af353", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type":
