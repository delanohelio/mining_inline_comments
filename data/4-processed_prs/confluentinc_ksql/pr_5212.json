Seems normally for an internal endpoint to have a different port. And wouldn't that cause a port clash on startup?\n\nI explained this much better when talking with Tim in comments.   In practice, we want the ksql.advertised.listener to refer to the thing bound by ksql.internal.listener, since this advertising is only for inter-node internal requests.  Even if we wanted to call an existing, publicly facing endpoint, I think it's useful to differentiate where it's coming from and actually create an internal version of the endpoint (which can of course, delegate to the same logic, if necessary).  The alternative is to have a ksql.advertised.listener and ksql.advertised.internal.listener, but this seems overly complex and would not accomplish the differentiation.\nksql.advertised.listener is just a way of explicitly stating whatever is already listened on, it doesn't actually bind any ports, so there should be no port clash.  ksql.internal.listener is more analogous to listeners.  If those are set to the same port, it will attempt to do the combined setup.\nI can see my description is poor.  Let me take another try at it.\n\n\nIf set, the internal endpoints don't use authentication.\n\nAside from the questionable English ;), the internal endpoints should definitely support authentication, otherwise its a security hole. It should be possible to configure that auth differently to the main endpoint. Yes, sometimes the internal endpoints can be locked down by other means, but not always, and some places will want the additional layer of protection that authentication brings regardless. Security is like Ogres.\n\nFor many internal calls, they're not being done on behalf of a user.  Pull queries are the exception.

Yet the example is talking more about an example where the listeners config is either using some form of localhost for the listeners config, or where the local host name is not resolvable/routable by other servers running the ksql nodes.\nIs this just me? Or would a better name help here?  It seems we have the following setups:\n\nSingle interface, using resolvable and routable host names, i.e. just using listeners config.\nSingle interface, using unresolvable or unroutable host names, i.e. using listeners and advertised configs.\nDual interface, where internal is resolvable and routable host name, i.e. using listeners and internal.listeners.\nDual interface, where internal is unresolvable or unroutable host name, i.e. using listeners, internal.listeners and advertised.listeners.\n\nI think it would make sense to have a section for each and explain the key part of needing to set advertised config is if either:\n\nthe config used for internal listeners, (either set explicitly or defaulting to listeners[0]), is using wildcards (which defaults to localhost) or explicitly using localhost, i.e. so it's not meaningful to other nodes\nor the explicit host name used for internal listeners, (either set explicitly or defaulting to listeners[0]), is either not resolvable to an IP, or that IP is not routable, from other ksql nodes.\n\nThe choice between these 4 modes doesn't have that much to do with the users choice between running auth or not running auth, (as you've alluded to in the Unsecure Environment section below). After all, they can run each with auth on or off.   However, which of these configurations they're running may affect how they need to configure auth. Maybe not right now, but certainly once/if we allow different auth to be set on the internal endpoints.  Hence I'd probably change the text in this page to say that running over dual network interfaces makes it possible to configure the network such that the inter-node endpoints ksqlDB uses are not accessible on the public listener(s).  If done correctly, this can be a more secure mode of deployment.
