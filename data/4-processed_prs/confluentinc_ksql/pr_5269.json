Each string entry in _groups_ explicitly defines a name used to logically group functions for which to share configuration properties.\n+\n+Given the following example:\n+\n+```java\n+@UdfDescription(\n+    name = \"someudf\",\n+    description = \"...\",\n+    author = \"...\",\n+    version = \"...\",\n+    groups = {\"shareit\"/*,\"...\"*/})\n+public class SomeUdf implements Configurable {\n+    //...\n+}\n+```\n+\n+allows to configure the function _someudf_ using `ksql.functions.someudf.my.value.x=foo` (basic, single-UDF config) or `ksql.groups.functions.shareit.my.value.x=foo` (grouped config across several functions declaring the same group name(s)). This distinction also makes it obvious, whether configuration properties are set for single functions or several grouped functions respectively.\n+\n+A drawback of the meta-data driven approach is that the group information must be declared in the code. If this restriction turns out to be an issue, a future enhancement could allow to explicitly define the group information in the configuration properties like so:  ?`ksql.groups.define.group_name=...,...` which for the particular example above would read `ksql.groups.define.shareit=someudf`.\n+\n+The benefits of this design are:\n+\n+* full backwards compatibility because groups config meta-data is a new option\n+* the default and most common case is to configure a single function which means that it stays simple for users\n+* it is easy to add new configurations\n+* the grouping is neither derived from the name itself (e.g. prefix matching) nor is it tied to java package naming convention\n+\n+## Test plan\n+\n+Test and failure scenarios are rather straight-foward, focusing only on different ways to set and read configuration properties for UDFs. There shouldn't be a need for scale/load/performance testing because this KLIP doesn't affect any criticial areas in that regard.\n+\n+## LOEs and Delivery Milestones\n+\n+To be defined by product manager and team.\n+\n+## Documentation Updates\n+\n+The current documentation regarding configuration options for custom UDFs isn't overly specific but of course needs to be updated accordingly. **It's important to be very clear and call out the dropped support of the `_global_` configuration scope which leads to a breaking change for upgrading/migrating workloads.**\n+\n+## Compatibility Implications\n+\n+As the design proposal suggests to remove support of the `_global_` scope, this means that upgrading the ksqlDB version will lead to a breaking change in that regard. However, the implementation of the `*` wildcard prefix matching of UDFs' names should be carried out in a backwards compatible way such that it can reasonably support the \"old\" (i.e. current) and the \"new\" (i.e. what's proposed here) configuration options in parallel.", "originalCommit": "0637c823eebcc8278c25a667bdf64ba95349466e", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0NTY1ODcwNw==", "url": "https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/pull/5269#discussion_r445658707", "bodyText": "thx. turns out I'm a bit blind when reading this for the ... time ;-)", "author": "hpgrahsl", "createdAt": "2020-06-25T15:48:00Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0NDU4MDA2MQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0NDk3MzU5OQ==", "url": "https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/pull/5269#discussion_r444973599", "bodyText": "Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n            **tl;dr:** This KLIP suggests to introduce a new configuration option in order to define UDF properties, that can be shared among a group / family of (custom) UDFs which logically belong together.

While this may or may not be an issue depending on the type of properties, in general, it can be considered less than ideal. For instance, this leads to security concerns for sensitive configuration properties such as secrets / tokens / passwords, which is why the `_global_` scope should get dropped.\n+\n+## What is in scope\n+\n+This KLIP aims to allow for multiple, yet specifically defined UDFs, to share configuration properties other than \"misusing\" the global properties scope.\n+\n+## What is not in scope\n+\n+The scope of this KLIP is not a complete rewrite of the current configuration mechanisms, but a modified implementation that suppports the sharing of configuration properties between specific (custom) UDFs.\n+\n+## Value/Return\n+\n+The main value of this KLIP lies in the fact that users can easily define certain configuration properties that are shared by N >= 2 UDFs. This can be done without specifying such properties multiple times, once for each UDF in need, or without \"misusing the global scope\", both of which can be considered workarounds at best.\n+\n+## Public APIS\n+\n+There should neither be public API changes nor any KSQL query language modifications necessary. Ideally, the chosen implementation allows for existing configurations to be upgraded / migrated to newer ksqlDB versions without changes for configurations tied to specific UDFs.\n+\n+**Note however, that for workloads which make use of the `_global_` scope it will lead to a breaking change since support for this  gets dropped.**\n+\n+## Design\n+\n+A simple approach is to extend the function meta-data and add a _groups_ option to the `@UdfDecription` annotation, which takes a list of strings. Each string entry in _groups_ explicitly defines a name used to logically group functions for which to share configuration properties.\n+\n+Given the following example:\n+\n+```java\n+@UdfDescription(\n+    name = \"someudf\",\n+    description = \"...\",\n+    author = \"...\",\n+    version = \"...\",\n+    groups = {\"shareit\"/*,\"...\"*/})\n+public class SomeUdf implements Configurable {\n+    //...\n+}\n+```\n+\n+allows to configure the function _someudf_ using `ksql.functions.someudf.my.value.x=foo` (basic, single-UDF config) or `ksql.groups.functions.shareit.my.value.x=foo` (grouped config across several functions declaring the same group name(s)). This distinction also makes it obvious, whether configuration properties are set for single functions or several grouped functions respectively.", "originalCommit": "0637c823eebcc8278c25a667bdf64ba95349466e", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0NTY1MDk5Mw==", "url": "https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/pull/5269#discussion_r445650993", "bodyText": "Not sure if I get your point on this one. I think putting groups in front should be clear since what follows .functions is already the function name except for the _global_ convention.
