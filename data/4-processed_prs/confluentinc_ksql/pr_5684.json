Instead, the implications are that queries a users could previously run will now fail. Existing running queries will not be affected.\n\nAffected queries will be any using combining:\n\n* A join\n* with a projection using a scoped 'all columns', e.g. a A.*\n* with a where clause\n\ne.g.\n\n```\nSELECT A.*, B.Id\n   FROM A\n     JOIN B ON A.Id = B.userId\n   WHERE A.x < 10;\n```", "committedDate": "2020-06-25T15:42:25Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0NTY2Mzc0MA==", "url": "https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/pull/5684#discussion_r445663740", "bodyText": "To understand the solution, first understand the logical model of the query:\nSource A            Source B\n   |                   |\n   --------Join---------\n             |\n       Where Filter\n             |\n       Final Projection\n\nThe final SELECT / projection node calls its parent to resolve any select stars.  In the case of A.* it passes A as the source name to expand when calling resolveSelectStart.\nThe parent WHERE filter uses the default impl of the resolveSelectStar method, which just looks for a parent node with a matching source name, if one is provided.\nA Join node does not have a source name, i.e. it's neither A or B, so the default resolveSelectStart was ignoring it.\nThe fix is to change the default method to include any parent node that has no source name, thereby including the parent join node.", "author": "big-andy-coates", "createdAt": "2020-06-25T15:55:34Z", "path": "ksqldb-engine/src/main/java/io/confluent/ksql/planner/plan/PlanNode.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -103,7 +103,9 @@ public DataSourceNode getLeftmostSourceNode() {\n       final Optional<SourceName> sourceName\n   ) {\n     return getSources().stream()\n-        .filter(s -> !sourceName.isPresent() || sourceName.equals(s.getSourceName()))\n+        .filter(s -> !sourceName.isPresent()\n+            || !s.getSourceName().isPresent()\n+            || sourceName.equals(s.getSourceName()))", "originalCommit": "a3ebbf58e261460e18d0e7bc139078bdcf9eb49c", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}]}
