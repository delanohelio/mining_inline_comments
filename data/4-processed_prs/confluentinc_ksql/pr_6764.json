You want the new version of the query to start processing rows\n+where the old version left off. This is generally known as *upgrading* a query.\n+\n+## In action\n+\n+```sql\n+-- Before\n+CREATE STREAM valid_purchases AS\n+  SELECT *\n+  FROM purchases\n+  WHERE cost > 0.00 AND quantity > 0;\n+\n+-- After\n+CREATE OR REPLACE STREAM valid_purchases AS\n+  SELECT *\n+  FROM purchases\n+  WHERE quantity > 0;\n+```\n+\n+## Upgrade types\n+\n+ksqlDB provides two mechanisms to change a query that is already running:\n+\n+1. *In-place upgrades*: you modify the behavior of a query, and it resumes from a\n    previously committed offset. The syntax that ksqlDB uses to indicate an\n    in-place upgrade is `CREATE OR REPLACE`.\n-1. *Replacing upgrades*: these upgrades require you to tear down existing\n-   queries, and start a new one from either `earliest` or `latest` offsets.\n+1. *Replacing upgrades*: you tear down an existing query,\n+   and start a new one from either `earliest` or `latest` offsets.\n    To accomplish this, users you first issue a `TERMINATE <query_id>;` and a\n    `DROP <source>` before creating the query again.\n \n ## Understanding upgrades\n \n-To better understand the different types of upgrades that exist on continuous\n-queries, we define a taxonomy on query upgrades as any combination of three\n-types of characteristics: _source query_, _upgrade_ and (optionally) _environment_.\n+Obviously, it would be preferable to always perform an in-place upgrade\n+when you change a query.
