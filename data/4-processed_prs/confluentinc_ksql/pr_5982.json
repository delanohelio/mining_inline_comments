Think about how this is being invoked:\nLATEST_BY_OFFSET(Col0, 2)\nThe above takes two parameters, not one.  Yes, the first is the parameter that will be passed to the aggregator on each agg call, and any after that must be literals and are passed to the aggregators init call.  But they are all parameters!\n\nI'm wondering how this will bite us in the future\n\nWe need to overhaul out UDAF framework at some point to support multiple input expressions, not just constants. This is needed to implement a proper topN UDAF for example. However, when we come to do this we will need to change all this code anyway. So I don't think this is painting us into a corner.\n\none place that comes to mind is when we describe the function I think it'll now include the initialization parameters when it shouldn't.\n\nI disagree, I think it should include the init params. The fact that describe currently excludes the init params is probably very confusing!  Take the second example LATEST_BY_OFFSET method in the description above. The one with two parameters.  Describing it only lists one parameter, which is wrong.\n\nAnother problem might come from handling of the schema provider annotations, which currently take in a list of the parameters (not including the initialization literals)\n\nThis is accounted for in the code.  The init params are added to end of the param described by the schema annotation.\nMy conclusion after looking into making this change is that it works for now and allows users to create variants of UDAFs that take constants as additional parameters, like the enhancement to LATEST_BY_OFFSET @sarwarbhuiyan wants to raise in a PR.  Longer term, we need a better solution. We desperately need UDAF support for schema provider functions, not just annotations. But this is a much bigger piece of work, and requires more thought, a KLIP, and resourcing.  This improves things in the short term, without hurting the long term, IMHO.\nOf course, that's not to say there isn't some gotcha I've not thought of... but we can't not make changes on this basis, otherwise we'd never change anything ;)", "author": "big-andy-coates", "createdAt": "2020-08-12T09:49:11Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2ODg0NDY4NQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "5231494751de980fc4df3d653e773d951ec4df3a", "url": "https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/commit/5231494751de980fc4df3d653e773d951ec4df3a", "message": "Merge branch 'master' into udaf_differentiate_by_initParams", "committedDate": "2020-08-12T14:54:33Z", "type": "commit"}]}
