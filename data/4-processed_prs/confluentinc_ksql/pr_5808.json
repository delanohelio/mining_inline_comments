To enable\n+it in a Docker-based deployment, export an environment variable named\n+`KSQL_JMX_OPTS` with your JMX configuration and expose the port that\n+JMX will communicate over.\n+\n+To illustrate how that should look, take a look at this Docker Compose\n+snippet. This is an example of how ksqlDB server can be configured for\n+monitoring. The surrounding components, like the broker and CLI, are\n+omitted for brevity. You can see an example of a complete setup in the\n+[quickstart](https://ksqldb.io/quickstart.html).\n+\n+```yaml\n+ksqldb-server:\n+  image: confluentinc/ksqldb-server:0.10.1\n+  hostname: ksqldb-server\n+  container_name: ksqldb-server\n+  depends_on:\n+    - broker\n+    - schema-registry\n+  ports:\n+    - \"8088:8088\"\n+    - \"1099:1099\"\n+  environment:\n+    KSQL_LISTENERS: \"http://0.0.0.0:8088\"\n+    KSQL_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS: \"broker:9092\"\n+    KSQL_KSQL_SCHEMA_REGISTRY_URL: \"http://schema-registry:8081\"\n+    KSQL_KSQL_LOGGING_PROCESSING_STREAM_AUTO_CREATE: \"true\"\n+    KSQL_KSQL_LOGGING_PROCESSING_TOPIC_AUTO_CREATE: \"true\"\n+    KSQL_JMX_OPTS: >\n+      -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=localhost\n+      -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote\n+      -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=1099\n+      -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false\n+      -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false\n+      -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.rmi.port=1099\n+```\n+\n+With respect to monitoring, here it what this does:\n+\n+- The environment variable `KSQL_JMX_OPTS` is supplied to the server\n+  with various arguments. The `>` character lets you write a\n+  multi-line string in Yaml, which makes this long argument easier to\n+  read. The advertised hostname, port, and security settings are\n+  configured. JMX has a wide range of [configuration\n+  options](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html),\n+  and you can set these however you like.\n+\n+- Port `1099` is exposed, which corresponds to the JMX port set in the\n+  `KSQL_JMX_OPTS` configuration. This allows remote monitoring tools\n+  to communicate into ksqlDB's process.\n+\n+## Verifying your monitoring setup\n+\n+An easy way to check that ksqlDB is properly emitting metrics is by\n+using `jconsole`. JConsole is a graphical monitoring tool to monitor\n+the JVM, and it ships with by default with Oracle JDK installations.\n+\n+On your host machine, simply run the command:\n+\n+```\n+jconsole\n+```\n+\n+You will be prompted for a host and port. If you used the example\n+configuration, `localhost:1099` will establish the connection.
