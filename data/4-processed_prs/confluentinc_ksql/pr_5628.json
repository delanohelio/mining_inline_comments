Thanks for your contribution!\n+\n+Functionality\n+-------------\n+\n+Clients should support the following functionality:\n+- [Push and pull queries](#push-and-pull-queries)\n+- [Terminating push queries](#terminating-push-queries)\n+- [Inserting new rows of data into existing ksqlDB streams](#inserting-new-rows-of-data-into-existing-ksqldb-streams)\n+- [Listing existing streams, tables, topics, and queries](#listing-existing-streams-tables-topics-and-queries)\n+- [Creation and deletion of streams and tables](#creation-and-deletion-of-streams-and-tables)\n+- [Terminating persistent queries](#terminating-persistent-queries)\n+\n+The easiest way for a ksqlDB client to implement each of these pieces of functionality is to send HTTP\n+requests to the ksqlDB server. See below for the relevant server endpoints.\n+\n+### Push and pull queries ###\n+\n+Push and pull queries may be issued by sending HTTP requests to the [`/query-stream` server endpoint](../../developer-guide/ksqldb-rest-api/streaming-endpoint.md#executing-pull-or-push-queries).\n+As explained in the [server endpoint documentation](../../developer-guide/ksqldb-rest-api/streaming-endpoint.md#executing-pull-or-push-queries),\n+the body of the HTTP request includes the query statement as well as any relevant query properties.\n+\n+If no errors are encountered while processing the query statement, the server will write a\n+metadata row to the response, followed by one or more result rows.\n+\n+The metadata includes:\n+- result column names\n+- result column types, e.g., `STRING`, `INTEGER`, `DOUBLE`, `DECIMAL(4, 2)`, `ARRAY<STRING>`, ``STRUCT<`F1` STRING, `F2` INTEGER>``, etc.\n+- query ID, in the case of push queries\n+\n+The client must expose these metadata fields as part of its API. In particular, the query ID is used for\n+[terminating push queries](#terminating-push-queries).\n+\n+The client representation of result rows must support all of the different data types supported by ksqlDB:\n+\n+| Data type | Example column type string in metadata |\n+|-----------|----------------------------------------|\n+| STRING    | STRING                                 |\n+| INTEGER   | INTEGER                                |\n+| BIGINT    | BIGINT                                 |\n+| DOUBLE    | DOUBLE                                 |\n+| BOOLEAN   | BOOLEAN                                |\n+| DECIMAL   | DECIMAL(4, 2)                          |\n+| ARRAY     | ARRAY<INTEGER>                         |\n+| MAP       | MAP<STRING, DOUBLE>                    |\n+| STRUCT    | STRUCT<\\`F1\\` STRING, \\`F2\\` INTEGER>  |\n+\n+Array, map, and struct types may be recursively nested within each other, and may contain any of the other types as well.\n+\n+Users of the client may wish to receive result rows in different ways:\n+- Do not block. Rather, perform an action asynchronously on each new row as it arrives\n+- Block until the next row arrives\n+- Block until all rows have arrived. This only makes sense in the context of pull queries and push queries with `LIMIT` clauses. \n+\n+Details of client interfaces to support these methods vary by language. For example, the [Java client](java-client.md)\n+uses [Reactive Streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org/) for its asynchronous streaming interface. \n+\n+### Terminating push queries ###\n+\n+Terminate push queries by sending HTTP requests to the [`/close-query` server endpoint](../../developer-guide/ksqldb-rest-api/streaming-endpoint.md#terminating-queries).\n+The client must expose an interface that enables users to pass in a push query ID to be passed to this endpoint.\n+\n+As explained in the [server endpoint documentation](../../developer-guide/ksqldb-rest-api/streaming-endpoint.md#terminating-queries),\n+the body of the HTTP request specifies the query ID. For successful requests, the response body will be empty.\n+\n+### Inserting new rows of data into existing ksqlDB streams ###\n+\n+ksqlDB supports inserting new rows of data into existing ksqlDB streams via the [`/inserts-stream` server endpoint](../../developer-guide/ksqldb-rest-api/streaming-endpoint.md#inserting-rows-into-an-existing-stream).\n+\n+As explained in the [server endpoint documentation](../../developer-guide/ksqldb-rest-api/streaming-endpoint.md#inserting-rows-into-an-existing-stream),\n+the initial HTTP request body specifies the name of the target stream. If the server successfully\n+validates this target stream name, the client may then write JSON-serialized rows of data to the\n+connection. The server inserts each row asynchronously and writes an ack containing the relevant\n+sequence number to the response.\n+\n+Because the insertions happen asynchronously on the server side, it makes sense for the client to expose APIs\n+for inserting one row at a time, but inserting batches of rows is less useful due to the lack of transactional guarantees.\n+\n+The client should provide a convenient way for users to create rows of data to insert.\n+The Java client's [KsqlObject](api/io/confluent/ksql/api/client/KsqlObject.html) is one example,\n+though details will vary by language.\n+\n+### Listing existing streams, tables, topics, and queries ###\n+\n+Send these admin operation requests to the [`/ksql` server endpoint](../ksqldb-rest-api/ksql-endpoint.md).\n+\n+The following table contains the statement text that should be sent in the body of the HTTP request\n+for each type of client admin operation:\n+\n+| Admin operation             | SQL statement text |\n+|-----------------------------|--------------------|\n+| List ksqlDB streams         | LIST STREAMS;      |\n+| List ksqlDB tables          | LIST TABLES;       |\n+| List Kafka topics           | LIST TOPICS;       |\n+| List running ksqlDB queries | LIST QUERIES;      |\n+\n+The [server endpoint documentation](../ksqldb-rest-api/ksql-endpoint.md)\n+contains the format of the server response body for each type of request.
