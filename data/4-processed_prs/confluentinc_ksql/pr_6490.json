This can sometimes cause MacOS to also become unresponsive.\n\nWell, I've finally tracked down the cause! The Confluent `TestUtils` class the code used to create temporary directories registers a shutdown hook for each temp directory created to ensure the directory is deleted on shutdown. (Simply calling `deleteOnExist` is not enough, as this fails if the directory is not empty).\n\nA new directory is created for each QTT/RQTT test.  This means thousands of hooks are registered, (there's currently over 5K QTT tests).  When the JVM is shutting down it creates THOUSANDS of threads, each trying to delete one directly.\n\nFixed by having a single parent directory, with a single shutdown hook.", "committedDate": "2020-10-22T13:41:36Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxMDMxMTMwMg==", "url": "https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/pull/6490#discussion_r510311302", "bodyText": "Living in the past, I see ;P", "author": "vcrfxia", "createdAt": "2020-10-22T16:48:15Z", "path": "ksqldb-functional-tests/src/main/java/io/confluent/ksql/test/utils/TestUtils.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,74 @@\n+/*\n+ * Copyright 2019 Confluent Inc.", "originalCommit": "68331d9b6ae9626ff8f41b283aaae1846aa7c692", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "ff1847e8d4ecc86e7025fb6b315d06af3b85bcbe", "url": "https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/commit/ff1847e8d4ecc86e7025fb6b315d06af3b85bcbe", "message": "Merge branch 'master' into qtt_lock_up", "committedDate": "2020-10-23T12:41:26Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "0a3cba4601136d1e9d4b8e04a5d03ee88619d2f1", "url": "https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/commit/0a3cba4601136d1e9d4b8e04a5d03ee88619d2f1", "message": "chore: update copyright year", "committedDate": "2020-10-23T12:42:11Z", "type": "commit"}]}
