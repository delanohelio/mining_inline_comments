Logging this will help highlight the cause.\nDuring a cluster resize or bounce this can be logged, but again, if someone is investigating spikes in pull query latency, such a log message may be useful.\nThoughts? cc @AlanConfluent @vpapavas", "author": "big-andy-coates", "createdAt": "2020-10-23T12:37:46Z", "path": "ksqldb-rest-app/src/main/java/io/confluent/ksql/rest/server/execution/PullQueryExecutor.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -381,7 +381,7 @@ static PullQueryResult handlePullQuery(\n           schemas.add(result.getTableRows().getSchema());\n           tableRows.addAll(result.getTableRows().getRows());\n         } catch (ExecutionException e) {\n-          LOG.debug(\"Error routing query {} to host {} at timestamp {} with exception {}\",\n+          LOG.warn(\"Error routing query {} to host {} at timestamp {} with exception {}\",", "originalCommit": "2a298ba80f240a09f6b05c526110c5bf702e1cb7", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxMTA2MjcxMw==", "url": "https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/pull/6512#discussion_r511062713", "bodyText": "Yes, I agree.
