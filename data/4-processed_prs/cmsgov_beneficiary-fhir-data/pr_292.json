Once the logs show that that the system is started (this can take a minute or so depending on your machine) the logs can be exited with Ctrl+C.\n-\n-Now the system can be interacted with. Here's an example of running tests for the `bfd-server` module.\n-\n-```\n-docker-compose exec bfd bash\n-cd /app/apps/bfd-server\n-mvn verify\n-```\n-\n-### Serving the BFD\n-\n-To run the BFD locally in a way that will allow you and other systems to interact with it some modifications need to be made so that it serves on a consistent port. Caution: Since this changes the code in the repository (server-start.sh) please keep in mind not to commit these changes.\n-\n-These changes are contained in the file `contributing/patches/allow_local_port_config.patch` and can be applied with \n-\n-```\n-make servable\n-```\n-To undo the changes run `make unservable`.\n+### Getting started\n \n-Once the changes are applied the server needs to be started in order for them to take effect.\n-Run `make up` if no docker containers are running or\n+Clone this repository to get started.\n \n ```\n-make restart\n+git clone https://github.com/CMSgov/beneficiary-fhir-data.git\n ```\n \n-if they're already running.\n-\n-The FHIR server should now be reachable from the browser at https://localhost:1337. In order for the FHIR server to trust your browser and return data, the client certificate at `apps/bfd-server/dev/ssl-stores/client-trusted-keystore.pfx` needs to be imported into the browser. The cert password is 'changeit'. \n-\n-In Chrome this can be done at `chrome://settings/certificates`. In Firefox it can be done at `about:preferences#privacy`, there is a button at the bottom called \"View Certificates\" that should give the option to import one. \n-Note MacOS Users: To make this cert available to Chrome or Firefox you'll need to add this cert to the Keychain application. \n-\n-### Loading data to work with\n+Then checkout a new branch to work on (the `-b` tells it to make a new branch).\n \n-First you'll want some synthetic data to load and work with. To fetch the synthetic data from a public S3 bucket:\n ```\n-make synthetic-data/*.rif\n+git checkout -b <your username>/<your feature name>\n+# If you ever have to rename this branch you can do so with\n+# git branch -m <your username>/<your feature name> <your username>/<your new name>\n ```\n+### Setting Up A Local Development Environment On Windows\n \n-Tip: This will download to a folder within the contributing folder within the repo. Consider moving this synthetic data outside the repo and updating your .env file to point to this new location. It will save you some steps in the future. \n-\n-To load some data for the BFD to return first apply the patches that allow the system to load local data: \n-\n-Caution: Since this changes the code in the repository please keep in mind not to commit these changes and to be aware of them while making your own changes. Reverse them before you submit your changes. \n-\n-```make loadable```\n-Then load the data \n-```make load```\n-This can take as long as an hour depending on your system.\n-\n-Once loaded going to a URL like [https://localhost:1337/v1/fhir/Patient/-19990000000001?_format=json](https://localhost:1337/v1/fhir/Patient/-19990000000001?_format=json) in your browser should show you some data.\n-\n+Going to work on this project or one of the other Blue Button Java projects?
