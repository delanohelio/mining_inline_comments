More information about compliance on Google Cloud and an up-to-date list of products covered under BAA can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance/hipaa/).\n+\n+In addition to the platform, the [tools for deployment](Terraform/README.md) on GCP are designed to assist organizations in their end-to-end compliance journey. Although achieving compliance is the responsibility of the customer, these toolkits enable organizations to deploy FDA MyStudies in a way that will help meet compliance requirements; such as setting up audit logs for retaining data. \n+\n+Google Cloud can support customer compliance with 21 CFR Part 11 regulations when using GCP services in a prescribed manner to handle related data and workloads. While Google has a cloud technology stack ready for many 21 CFR Part 11 compliant workloads, the ultimate compliance determination depends on configuration choices made by the customer.\n+\n+## What\u2019s changed?\n+\n+While the overall goals, compliance principles and functionality are unchanged, this release introduces several changes from previous versions of FDA MyStudies:\n+\n+*   Architecture\n+    *   Migrated from a VM architecture to a modular container-based architecture\n+    *   Refactored Participant Datastore\n+    *   Migrated to permissive open-source dependencies\n+    *   Removed dependencies that require commercial licenses\n+    *   Simplified mobile app calls and moved some functionality server-side\n+    *   Improved alignment of responsibilities between components\n+    *   Adjusted data storage based on usage and security requirements (e.g. study and participant status storage and calls were moved to Response Datastore, enrollment generation logic was moved to Participant Datastore)\n+    \n+*   Security\n+    *   Improved the existing authentication in place (e.g. removed application secret from being transmitted in all calls, unified the process into a single auth server)\n+    *   Added HTTPs across codebase\n+    *   Fixed potential cross site scripting vulnerabilities", "originalCommit": "e580c0333273ac491d0c75c1cbd942a37fbc6829", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQxNjgyMzkyNA==", "url": "https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/fda-mystudies/pull/258#discussion_r416823924", "bodyText": "Hidden for now", "author": "jkrogers18", "createdAt": "2020-04-28T18:15:32Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQxNjc5NzExOQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "973f76d4b8b61f2daa46bdf39b3cd52e76d90964", "url": "https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/fda-mystudies/commit/973f76d4b8b61f2daa46bdf39b3cd52e76d90964", "message": "Update README.md", "committedDate": "2020-04-28T18:18:28Z", "type": "commit"}]}
