If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't\n-anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the\n-Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator\n-on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of\n-model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.\n-The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition,\n-injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>\n\\ No newline at end of file\n+\n+<!DOCTYPE html>\n+<html>\n+\n+<head>\n+<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n+<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\">\n+<title>Study Builder Privacy Policy</title>\n+<link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto&display=swap\"\n+\trel=\"stylesheet\">\n+\n+<!-- Favicon -->\n+<link rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"/studybuilder/images/icons/FAV_Icon.png\"\n+\ttype=\"image/x-icon\" />\n+<link rel=\"apple-touch-icon\"\n+\thref=\"/studybuilder/images/icons/FAV_Icon.png\">\n+\n+<style type=\"text/css\">\n+body {\n+\tbackground: #eef2f5;\n+\tfont-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;\n+\tmargin: 0;\n+}\n+\n+.main__container .main__content h2 {\n+\tcolor: #001871;\n+\tfont-size: 14px;\n+\tfont-weight: 600;\n+\ttext-transform: uppercase;\n+}\n+\n+.main__container .main__content p {\n+\tcolor: #2d2926;\n+\tfont-size: 14px;\n+}\n+\n+.main__container {\n+\tbackground: #fff;\n+\tpadding: 20px 0;\n+\tborder-radius: 4px;\n+}\n+\n+.main__container .main__content {\n+\tpadding: 0 30px;\n+}\n+\n+.main__container, .main__container__title {\n+\twidth: 90%;\n+\tmargin: auto;\n+}\n+\n+.main__container__title {\n+\tpadding: 0;\n+\tmargin-bottom: 30px;\n+}\n+\n+#terms {\n+\tmargin-bottom: 30px;\n+}\n+\n+.terms__logo {\n+\tbackground: #fff;\n+}\n+\n+.terms__logo .main__container {\n+\tpadding-top: 30px;\n+\tpadding-bottom: 0px;\n+\tmargin-bottom: 30px;\n+\tline-height: 0;\n+}\n+</style>\n+</head>\n+\n+<body>\n+\t<section id=\"terms\">\n+\t\t<section class=\"terms__logo\">\n+\t\t\t<div class=\"main__container \">\n+\t\t\t\t<img src=\"/studybuilder/images/logo/logo_innerScreens.png\">\n+\t\t\t</div>\n+\t\t</section>\n+\t\t<section>\n+\t\t\t<div class=\"main__container__title\">Privacy Policy</div>\n+\t\t\t<div class=\"main__container\">\n+\t\t\t\t<div class=\"main__content\">\n+\t\t\t\t\t<h2>SUBTITLE GOES HERE</h2>\n+\t\t\t\t\t<p>Content goes here</p>\n+\t\t\t\t</div>", "originalCommit": "b238b63cc3e0b078de1658d50f4be0163cb4c1e1", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwODk5MTYwMQ==", "url": "https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/fda-mystudies/pull/132#discussion_r408991601", "bodyText": "nit: please remove space before period.", "author": "zohrehj", "createdAt": "2020-04-15T16:54:59Z", "path": "WCP/fdahpStudyDesigner/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/view/study/consentInfo.jsp", "diffHunk": "@@ -94,7 +94,7 @@\n \t\t\t</div>\n \t\t\t<div class=\"clearfix\"></div>\n \t\t\t<div>\n-\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gray-xs-f mb-xs\">Show as a visual step ? <span class=\"requiredStar\">*</span><span class=\"ml-xs sprites_v3 filled-tooltip\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" title=\"Choose Yes if you wish this section to appear as a standalone Visual Step in the app prior to the full Consent Document.
