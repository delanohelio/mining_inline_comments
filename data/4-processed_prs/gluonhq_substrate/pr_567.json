I don't think Graal does anything specific with that argument. What I have done in this PR is to basically replace \"myapp\" with argv[0].\nI have no idea how iOS and Android are being launched by the OS. In any case, you can't launch the application from command line and pass in arbitrary command line arguments on those systems anyway, so the issue that is being fixed by this PR doesn't apply there. But we still require that first argument to be passed down to Graal, so for now, \"myapp\" can remain on iOS and Android.", "author": "tiainen", "createdAt": "2020-05-04T17:23:08Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQxOTU1OTk0NA=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}]}
