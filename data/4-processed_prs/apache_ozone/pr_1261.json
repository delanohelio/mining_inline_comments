It's very useful for long and flaky test runs.\nBut it's somewhat more complex.\nRecently I started to think to use a \"fail fast\" approach. It can simplify the scripts and we can use set -e to be sure we don't ignore any internal errors.\nIt's not working everywhere, but here it could.\nBut I am fine with this approach (which is better to create a summary), just sharing my thoughts.\n</discussion-mode:on>", "author": "elek", "createdAt": "2020-07-29T10:41:25Z", "path": "hadoop-ozone/dev-support/checks/bats.sh", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,35 @@\n+#!/usr/bin/env bash\n+# Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more\n+# contributor license agreements.
