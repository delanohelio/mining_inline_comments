I think it would be simpler to just take the write lock at the start and forget about the read lock.\nThe part of the code under the read lock should be very fast, and the code under the write lock may be slow (compactDB) so I suspect we are saving very little by doing some work under the read lock. I think this lock is also only for this container (not for all containers on the DN) so contention should not be a big issue.\nWhat do you think?", "author": "sodonnel", "createdAt": "2021-01-06T20:58:38Z", "path": "hadoop-hdds/container-service/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/ozone/container/keyvalue/KeyValueContainer.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -516,22 +516,36 @@ public void importContainerData(InputStream input,\n   @Override\n   public void exportContainerData(OutputStream destination,\n       ContainerPacker<KeyValueContainerData> packer) throws IOException {\n-    // Closed/ Quasi closed containers are considered for replication by\n-    // replication manager if they are under-replicated.\n-    ContainerProtos.ContainerDataProto.State state =\n-        getContainerData().getState();\n-    if (!(state == ContainerProtos.ContainerDataProto.State.CLOSED ||\n-        state == ContainerDataProto.State.QUASI_CLOSED)) {\n-      throw new IllegalStateException(\n-          \"Only closed/quasi closed containers could be exported: \" +\n-              \"Where as ContainerId=\"\n-              + getContainerData().getContainerID() + \" is in state \" + state);\n+    readLock();", "originalCommit": "1ae7e06f27a0efefb9252eb99d7da912f7793946", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU1Mjk3OTIxNA==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/ozone/pull/1730#discussion_r552979214", "bodyText": "Agreed, the first read lock can be removed.
