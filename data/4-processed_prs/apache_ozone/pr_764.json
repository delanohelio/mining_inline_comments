It was required to compile the core hadoop-hdfs/hadoop-common artifacts before compiling the Ozone subprojects. During the development this dependency was reduced more and more. With the 0.4.1 release this dependency has been totally removed and it became possible to compile Ozone with the help of the released Hadoop artifacts which made it possible to separate the development of Ozone from the main Hadoop trunk branch.\n+\n+At the October of 2019 the Ozone sources are moved out to the [apache/hadoop-ozone](https://github.com/apache/hadoop-ozone) git reposity.
