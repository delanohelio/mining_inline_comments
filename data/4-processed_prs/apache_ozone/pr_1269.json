The ozone shell is\n+invoked via ```sh``` command.\n+\n+The object can be a volume, bucket or a key. The action is various verbs like\n+create, list, delete etc.\n+\n+Ozone URL can point to a volume, bucket or keys in the following format:\n+\n+_\\[schema\\]\\[server:port\\]/volume/bucket/key_\n+\n+\n+Where,\n+\n+1. **Schema** - This should be `o3` which is the native RPC protocol to access\n+  Ozone API. The usage of the schema is optional.\n+\n+2. **Server:Port** - This is the address of the Ozone Manager. If the port is\n+omitted the default port from ozone-site.xml will be used.\n+\n+Depending on the call, the volume/bucket/key names will be part of the URL.\n+Please see volume commands, bucket commands, and key commands section for more\n+detail.\n+\n+## Volume operation\n+\n+Volume is the top level element of the hierarchy and supposed to managed only by the administrators. Quota and the owner user can be defined.\n+\n+Example commands:\n+\n+```shell\n+> ozone sh volume create /vol1\n+```\n+\n+```shell\n+bash-4.2$ ozone sh volume info /vol1\n+{\n+  \"metadata\" : { },\n+  \"name\" : \"vol1\",\n+  \"admin\" : \"hadoop\",\n+  \"owner\" : \"hadoop\",\n+  \"creationTime\" : \"2020-07-28T12:31:50.112Z\",\n+  \"modificationTime\" : \"2020-07-28T12:31:50.112Z\",\n+  \"acls\" : [ {\n+    \"type\" : \"USER\",\n+    \"name\" : \"hadoop\",\n+    \"aclScope\" : \"ACCESS\",\n+    \"aclList\" : [ \"ALL\" ]\n+  }, {\n+    \"type\" : \"GROUP\",\n+    \"name\" : \"users\",\n+    \"aclScope\" : \"ACCESS\",\n+    \"aclList\" : [ \"ALL\" ]\n+  } ],\n+  \"quota\" : 1152921504606846976\n+}\n+```\n+\n+```shell\n+ozone sh volume list /\n+{\n+  \"metadata\" : { },\n+  \"name\" : \"s3v\",\n+  \"admin\" : \"hadoop\",\n+  \"owner\" : \"hadoop\",\n+  \"creationTime\" : \"2020-07-27T11:32:22.314Z\",\n+  \"modificationTime\" : \"2020-07-27T11:32:22.314Z\",\n+  \"acls\" : [ {\n+    \"type\" : \"USER\",\n+    \"name\" : \"hadoop\",\n+    \"aclScope\" : \"ACCESS\",\n+    \"aclList\" : [ \"ALL\" ]\n+  }, {\n+    \"type\" : \"GROUP\",\n+    \"name\" : \"users\",\n+    \"aclScope\" : \"ACCESS\",\n+    \"aclList\" : [ \"ALL\" ]\n+  } ],\n+  \"quota\" : 1152921504606846976\n+}\n+....\n+```\n+## Bucket operation\n+\n+Bucket is the second level hierarchy, similar to the AWS S3 buckets.
