However, the creator does not need to be started for pipelines to get created. Infact, in order to exit safemode, there must be a replication factor 3 pipeline created, and that must happen without the creator running.\nThere are actually two ways a pipeline can be created:\n\n\nWhen the backgroundPipelineCreator is running, it starts every 2 minutes and tries to create pipelines.\n\n\nWhen a node registers with SCM, it triggers an event and calls backgroundPipelineCreator.triggerPipelineCreation(); which tries to create pipelines immediately - even if the BackgroundPipelineCreator has already been started.\n\n\nTherefore in safemode, before this patch, pipelines are initially created by (2) above. However now we want to stop that happening. Therefore whenever the precheck completes (enough nodes registered) we trigger the pipeline creation, but hold off on starting the background creator thread. Then it is started when safemode exits.\nNow that you have highlighted this, it is possibly valid to just start the BackgroundPipeLineCreator in both cases. However there is one further detail - in the existing implementation, there is a delay for safemode exiting. Once the rules have passed some services are not started for a delay of 5 minutes and the BackgroundPipelineCreator thread is one of them. I am not sure on the history of that so it probably makes sense to keep that logic for now.", "author": "sodonnel", "createdAt": "2020-03-30T21:46:29Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwMDQ4OTk3MA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwMDgxOTI0NA==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/ozone/pull/719#discussion_r400819244", "bodyText": "Oh, I missed one small detail in the shouldSchedulePipelineCreator method... and misinterpreted it sorry about that... So triggerPipelineCreation will create pipelines if the safemode precheck is finished and allowPipelineCreation is already true in SCMPipelineManager.\nWith that it makes perfect sense, that we want to trigger the pipeline creation once when precheck is complete, and start the scheduled runs after the safe mode is exited.\nBut in this case, it would be enough to call triggerPipelineCreation when we arrived to the end of the precheck stage, and start the background pipeline creator schedule when we left safe mode.\nNow what I understand happens at a startup when this is interesting is the following:\nfor (0..nodecount) {\ntriggerPipelineCreation() // noop as allowPipelineCreation is false\n}\nprecheck finished\ntriggerPipelineCreation // runs and creates pipelines\nsafe mode exit\nstartFixedIntervalPipelineCreator // calls createPipelines right away once at start\ntriggerPipelineCreation // tries to call createPipelines if it is not running from the prev. call\nI think we don't need this last call, which makes the triggerPipelines boolean unnecessary and the code a bit simpler.
