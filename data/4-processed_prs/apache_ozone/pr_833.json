XceiverClientGrpc automatically fails over from datanode to another and retries if it sees a failure.\nInfoSubCommand has recently been changed to not use readContainer call to read data from datanode. But , in Ozone, as we only use XceiverClientGrpc to read from datanode , it make sense here to use the same while reading the containerData as well (acquireClient -> acquireClientForReadData).
