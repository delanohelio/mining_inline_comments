I am the community developer who implemented 'fetch graph' in v5. Also I implemented entity graph fully in v6. Yeah, I agree. The current implementation is buggy and difficult to maintain. That is because v5 infrastructure and design makes it difficult to implement and that is why 'fetch graph' was not implemented for a long time. The status has been changed in v6 and I think we have implemented the whole entity graph elegantly there already.\nI would take a look at the PR and thanks for the two options to choose from.
