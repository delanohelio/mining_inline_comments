I'd imagine that most of the steps have largely stabilized at this point so perhaps that worry is no longer as much of a concern.  However, I still feel like these core step classes are TinkerPop's implementations and I'd not want to see our development blocked for fear of a breaking API change that affects providers (a behavioral change is different as it affects users and we would obviously be sensitive to that).\nPerhaps it would be good to start a DISCUSS thread on this on the dev list to see if there is any concerns with removing final for all steps with the idea that breaking API changes become a possibility for providers on patch releases if they choose to directly extend these core step classes. wdyt?", "author": "spmallette", "createdAt": "2020-08-20T14:59:25Z", "path": "gremlin-core/src/main/java/org/apache/tinkerpop/gremlin/process/traversal/step/map/GroupCountStep.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -41,7 +41,7 @@\n /**\n  * @author Marko A.
