The ApacheBench tool (ab) can load test servers by sending an arbitrary number of concurrent requests.\n+\n+The benchmarks measure the performance of torchserve on inference API for various models. It supports passed in a URL to the .mar file. It also runs various benchmarks using these models (see benchmarks section below).\n+\n+## Installation\n+\n+It assumes that you have followed quick start/installation section and have required pre-requisites i.e. python3, java and docker [if needed]. If not then please refer [quick start](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/README.md) for setup.\n+\n+### Ubuntu\n+\n+First check if you already have Apache Bench(ab) installed on your Ubuntu box(local/EC2 instance). The following code will help verify the installation \u2212\n \n-### For Ubuntu\n+#### ab -V\n \n+If ab is not installed on your machine, then please follow the following steps:\n+\n+Refresh the package database.\n+\n+```bash\n+apt-get update\n ```\n-apt-get install apache2-utils\n+Install the apache2-utils package to get access to ApacheBench.\n \n+```bash\n+apt-get install apache2-utils\n ```\n \n-Apache Bench is installed in Mac by default. You can test by running ```ab -h```\n+### macOS\n+\n+For mac, you will be using 'ab' which is by default installed in macOS. You can test by running ```ab -h```.\n+\n+Apart from ab, You will also need to have following:\n \n-## Benchmark \n+- bc: for metric percentile calculation\n+- nvidia-docker for gpu machine\n+\n+## Models\n+\n+The pre-trained models for the benchmark can be mostly found in the [TorchServe model zoo](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/docs/model_zoo.md)\n+\n+### Benchmarks\n+We support several basic benchmarks:\n+\n+- MMS throughput\n+- MMS latency P50\n+- MMS latency P90\n+- MMS latency P99\n+- MMS latency mean\n+- MMS HTTP error rate", "originalCommit": "a05eb5abc58bdd5dc84ffd5a02ce2c66108580b5", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}]}
