When passing the parameter `shouldCreateJmxFile` as `true`, an equivalent `.jmx` file can be generated from this test plan.\n+\n To help with debugging, you can open this `.jmx` file in the JMeter GUI and add Listeners.\n \n To see a sample implementation of a test case, you can refer to `StudentProfileLNPTest`. It is a _simple_ test case which load tests a GET endpoint (`/webapi/student/profile`).\n \n ## Running Performance Tests\n \n If you want to use your own copy of [JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi), update the `test.jmeter.*` properties in `src/e2e/resources/test.properties` accordingly.  \n-Start the backend server, i.e. `localhost:8080`, before running the performance tests.\n+\n+First, open the terminal and navigate to the root of project folder. Start the backend server, i.e. `./gradlew appengineRun`, before running the performance tests.", "originalCommit": "8c7cfccf0bc32eb96b839195d981a2eb01681e7f", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "abddc68b35e330581c79b981e0690299f77f0813", "url": "https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/commit/abddc68b35e330581c79b981e0690299f77f0813", "message": "add link to dev guide", "committedDate": "2020-06-15T14:36:56Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "280963233f1c0407774b7791fcdad53d78280767", "url": "https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/commit/280963233f1c0407774b7791fcdad53d78280767", "message": "Merge branch 'master' into update-lnp-doc", "committedDate": "2020-06-15T15:39:50Z", "type": "commit"}]}
