In that case the engine gets disposed (disposed == true), but the lock is not released as the \"worker\" thread doesn't hold the lock. But if the \"main\" thread calls disposeRuntimeEngine afterwards to release the lock, the engine is already disposed, so canDispose will return false and the lock is never released.

So in case there is yet another thread calling lock() for the same runtime engine, it gets a different lock, a new one, and both threads are now using the same runtime engine in parallel.
