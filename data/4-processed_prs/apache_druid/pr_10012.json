In Druid, there is a concept\n+ * of core partition set which is a set of segments atomically becoming queryable together in Brokers. The core\n+ * partition set is represented as a range of partitionIds. For {@link NumberedShardSpec}, the core partition set\n+ * is [0, {@link NumberedShardSpec#partitions}).\n+ *\n+ * The NumberedShardSpec is used for dynamic partitioning which is based on the number of rows in each segment.\n+ * In streaming ingestion, the core partition set size cannot be determined since it's impossible to know how many\n+ * segments will be created per time chunk. However, in batch ingestion with time chunk locking, the core partition\n+ * set is the set of segments created by an initial task or an overwriting task. Since the core partition set is\n+ * determined when the task publishes segments at the end, the task postpones creating proper NumberedShardSpec\n+ * until the end.\n+ *\n+ * This shardSpec is used for such use case. A non-appending batch task can use this shardSpec until it publishes\n+ * segments at last. When it publishes segments, it should convert the shardSpec of those segments to NumberedShardSpec.\n+ * See {@code SegmentPublisherHelper#annotateShardSpec} for converting to NumberedShardSpec. Note that, when\n+ * the segment lock is used, the Overlord coordinates the segment allocation and this class is never used. See\n+ * {@link PartialShardSpec} for that case.", "originalCommit": "f1aeddb63487c4e646acc7b541fd00a3079479df", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzODQ4OTYzOA==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/10012#discussion_r438489638", "bodyText": "In segment locking, any implementation of OverwriteShardSpec can be used when you overwrite segments.
