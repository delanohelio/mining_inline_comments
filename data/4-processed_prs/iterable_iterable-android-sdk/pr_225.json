If you keep using the same project for FCM and the same integration name, the old tokens will still be valid and won't require re-registration of existing devices.\n-\n-If you're using a different project for FCM and have existing devices on a GCM project with a different sender ID, updating the app will generate new tokens for users, but the old tokens will still be valid. When migrating from one sender ID to another, specify `legacyGCMSenderId` in `IterableConfig` when initializing the SDK. This will disable old tokens to make sure users won't receive duplicate notifications.", "originalCommit": "df086a04352a322ff4429d094c90fcd3e48aafc2", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}]}
