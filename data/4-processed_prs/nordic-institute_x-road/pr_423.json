I avoided statics on purpose, since I have this uneasy feeling with static utility classes. I always fear I might end up needing to mock those in tests, or override the util class behavior.

Too many bad experiences.\nI asked https://gofore.slack.com/archives/CCA0KKAVD/p1586356799085900 to help me find the light.\nThat being said, this feels like a good example of utility methods that a) won't change b) won't need to be mocked c) will only ever need one implementation so if we use static utility classes this is a good fit for them. And we do use static utility classes.\nI will either change this to static util class, or if not that then a Spring singleton bean.
