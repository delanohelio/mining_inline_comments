OK, now it is probably 99% sure, but this is a relevant issue when you factor in future changes and nontrivial DB constraints\nit deviates from the conventions used in other controllers - they mostly catch service layer exceptions and map those to controller layer / openapi exceptions. ServicesApiController.addEndpoint handles this by\n\n        } catch (EndpointAlreadyExistsException e) {\n            throw new ConflictException(e);\n\nBut, handling this on service layer is probably not as easy as catch DataIntegrityViolationException -> throw EndpointAlreadyExistsException. I believe constraints only kick in when transaction commits, and this only happens when service call ends, so we can't catch DataIntegrityViolationException in the service method? I believe the constraint needs to be validated in a similar way as in addEndpoint \n  \n    \n      X-Road/src/proxy-ui-api/src/main/java/org/niis/xroad/restapi/service/ServiceService.java\n    \n    \n        Lines 227 to 230\n      in\n      df9eef1\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n        \n          \n           if (client.getEndpoint().stream().anyMatch(existingEp -> existingEp.isEquivalent(endpointType))) { \n        \n\n        \n          \n               throw new EndpointAlreadyExistsException(\"Endpoint with equivalent service code, method and path already \" \n        \n\n        \n          \n                       + \"exists for this client\"); \n        \n\n        \n          \n           } \n        \n    \n  \n\n\nIt has to take into account endpoint ID probably, to distinguish between updated endpoint from the rest of them.\nThis adds some extra work to implement the constraints, which is unfortunate. If the service layer checks were too difficult to implement then some compromises or some generic handlers could be made.
