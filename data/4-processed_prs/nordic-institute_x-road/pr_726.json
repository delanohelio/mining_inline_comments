The build modes operate a bit weirdly now, as there are two modes that trigger a different-from-default build path, and absence of those triggers the default build path. Everything might a bit more straightforward if there was symmetry and buildLocally was also a mandatory parameter (but I am not very convinced that it would be optimal either). Now, putting the build-mode parameter into wrong index by mistake triggers wrong build path which may be an error that is possibly not immediately easy to detect. Especially when combined with how the sister-script compile_code.sh behaves (parameters do have free order) this is a recipe for confusion IMO.\nI know the free-order parameters are not perfect either (potential for masking sharing parameters - but shared parameters should be avoided in any case IMO), but this is still the way I would prefer.\nAs I put in my suggestion in #726 (comment), requiring build-mode parameters to be the first ones is also an acceptable solution IMO. I would prefer the free-order solution (especially after I've already spent the time to write and test it), but fixed order with improved documentation would be merged as well.\nI agree 100% with the point about shell code needing to be treated with care, and to be as clear and simple as possible, I don't think we have a disagreement there. However things like shift in for loops is confusing or is not confusing is more subjective, and also down to what solutions each developer is used to. IMO using shift in the for-loop is fine here. Maybe some additional comments would make it more clear:\n# remove all build-mode params (--package-only,-p,--docker-compile,-d), maintain others\nfor i in \"$@\"; do\n    # remove current parameter i from all params\n    shift\n    case \"$i\" in\n        --package-only|-p)\n            PACKAGE_ONLY=1\n            ;;\n        --docker-compile|-d)\n            DOCKER_COMPILE=1\n            ;;\n        --help|-h)\n            usage 0\n            ;;\n        *)\n            # bring back removed parameter i\n            set -- \"$@\" \"$i\"\n            ;;\n    esac\ndone", "author": "jansu76", "createdAt": "2020-12-21T10:51:12Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0NTg1NDI0OA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0NjY1ODkzOQ==", "url": "https://github.com/nordic-institute/X-Road/pull/726#discussion_r546658939", "bodyText": "I agree 100% with the point about shell code needing to be treated with care, and to be as clear and simple as possible, I don't think we have a disagreement there. However things like shift in for loops is confusing or is not confusing is more subjective, and also down to what solutions each developer is used to.\n\nWe can of course happily agree to disagree on that one :)\nJust one last remark, why I don't really favour the construction with the for loop: Usually shift is used when you always look at $1, and that's what you'd do in a while loop:\nwhile [ $# -gt 0 ]; do\n    case \"$1\" in\n        *) ...;; \n    esac\n    shift\ndone\n\nIn that case I consume the very parameter you're looking at. When using a for loop, shift does not work the same way, because it's always consuming the first parameter regardless which one is in $i. These are code blocks that people writing a lot of shell script code usually have in their heads and just put them in when necessary. Of course, in your case you're always consuming before looking, so the behaviour is consistent and defined, but still it takes some time to grasp.\n\nLooks like this still expects build-mode parameter to be in first position. If we were to do so, there is no reason for the for-loop over all parameters. The earlier syntax of\ncase \"$1\" in\n    --packageonly|-p) shift;;\n    --docker-build|-d) shift; buildInDocker \"$@\";;\n    *) shift; buildLocally \"$@\";;\nesac\n\nwould be simpler and better (copy-pasted from old, uses parameter names no longer in use).\nI will try to argue for the freely ordered build-mode (d/p) parameters. The build modes operate a bit weirdly now, as there are two modes that trigger a different-from-default build path, and absence of those triggers the default build path. Everything might a bit more straightforward if there was symmetry and buildLocally was also a mandatory parameter (but I am not very convinced that it would be optimal either). Now, putting the build-mode parameter into wrong index by mistake triggers wrong build path which may be an error that is possibly not immediately easy to detect. Especially when combined with how the sister-script compile_code.sh behaves (parameters do have free order) this is a recipe for confusion IMO.\n\nActually I do not think that the parameters to build_package.sh should be freely placable for two reasons:\n\nThe same parameters (e.g. -p or -d) could be legal for the script called afterwards. They'd get filtered out here which could cause problems.\nFor me as a user a clear distinction between parameters to the outer and parameters to the inner script makes sense. The simple method is just enforce parameters to the outer script at position 1, a more sophisticated would be to introduce a parameter -- after which everything will be ignored by the outer script.\n\nFor a build script as simple as this one I would prefer not to use the -- variant, because it makes the script longer than necessary and/or forces me to do \"dirty\" things like rebuilding $@. My original version's charm was its simplicity, but I accept that error handling (-p and -d) was missing.\nIn general I try to keep shell scripts short. My personal convention is to scrutinise everything significantly longer than an editor page and get rid of unnecessary stuff if possible (more code - more bugs, fatal in a programming language parsed only line by line).\nTo be honest, I still like my first version best, but the second would still be OK. I don't like the set -- \"$@\" \"$i\" construct, because basically everybody needs to look up what it does (that's by the way also my standard criticism on bashisms), and few people will be able to understand why it works.\nBut long story short (I do enjoy this kind of debates): if you really want the variant you proposed I'd be - reluctantly - willing to go along. I'd still prefer the simple one :)", "author": "mbert", "createdAt": "2020-12-21T11:38:45Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0NTg1NDI0OA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0NjY5NDczOA==", "url": "https://github.com/nordic-institute/X-Road/pull/726#discussion_r546694738", "bodyText": "Heh, looks like we have created quite a long debate about this detail :) Thanks for explaining your thinking, appreciated.
