Why are some version numbers 9.X and some just \"9\"? RHEL8 seems to be missing?). So the numbering felt problematic and a bit messy and I wanted to avoid the whole issue.\nI also though average reader is not too interested in things like Vue.js or Npm version, that this kind of detail does not necessarily need to be included (and updated) in this kind of \"big picture\" document.\nBut that is the backstory, looking at it now I don't think it is good.
