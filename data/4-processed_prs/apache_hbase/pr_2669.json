We have timestamp in server name so we could know whether it is the same region server, and for the rpc framework, there is no problem that they have the same stub key? We just use a string here and once we want to connect, we will resolve it and it will point to the correct ip address. We could point the hostname of a regionserver to another regionserver while both the regionservers are alive and can accept requests? This is not a good practice and can cause big troubles...
