If buffer usage reaches the quota limits, replication becomes stuck. And since we check the buffer usage at ReplicationSourceManager, that means a single buffer for all peers. If one peer is disabled, while other source peers were supposed to continue to get replicated edits, those source would also be stuck because of this, until an RS restart.", "author": "wchevreuil", "createdAt": "2020-08-05T09:40:00Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2NTI5NjAzNA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2NTg2NzE2NA==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/hbase/pull/2197#discussion_r465867164", "bodyText": "Makes sense.
