GH makes it difficult for me to follow previous conversation.\nOkay, so if you move this code out of the CompletableFuture, the CompletionException can just be re-thrown. It indicates a client-side problem, and there's nothing the test should try to recover.\nI would not catch IOException either, just let it bubble up. Instead, I would focus on meaningful subclasses of IOException. RetriesExhaustedException is a good place to work from: you know your client made some effort. There's potentially multiple cause instances under there, so i guess just pick one to work with, probably the last one. If it's a descendent of java.net.SocketException, you know the client couldn't get anywhere -- how should the test behave if the the master is not running?\nAfter that, I'm not really sure what's thrown in what cases. Our API's checked exception definitions aren't strong enough for me know by reading the interfaces. However, pretty much anything else means the client managed to get the RPC over to the server. I think that fact alone is enough to consider this part of the test has succeeded at its goal. Until the myriad other issues in master startup and shutdown are resolved, I think this is the best the client can hope for (for what it's worth, I think this test will continue to be flakey until those master-side problems are solved, and they cannot be resolved perfectly by client-side gymnastics).\nYou've looked at it, and seen the errors and test failures, more recently than I have, so what do you think? What brought you to this ticket in the first place? Are there more specific subclasses of IOException that are thrown, which you can use to reasonably address that specific condition? Paste the stack traces into Jira and the commit message so we can follow your effort.\nAnd thank you for your effort -- test fixing is usually thankless drudgery but it makes all of our lives better :)", "author": "ndimiduk", "createdAt": "2020-05-13T23:55:23Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyNDA5MTI4MQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyNDg4MDIxMg==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/hbase/pull/1690#discussion_r424880212", "bodyText": "Thanks @ndimiduk\nLet me put the code reference of the link that I mentioned.

First shutdown() throws an IOException (some subclass of it) and shuts down the master, the second (and later) shutdowns can't find a master to issue a shutdown and the stub fails and throws this MasterRegistryFetchException.\nNow that we decided to only do a single shutdown, we should either see the specific exception (derivate of IOException when shutdown failed) or no exception at all (if shutdown is a success, which is 99% of the test runs). I think we are good if we catch and log the first exception (don't remember the exact checked exception type).\nThe reason I suggested to keep the checks simple and catch the exception and log is because, if there was any issue in the RPC, that'd anyway reflect in the failure of shutdown join thread and the test fails and we have the exception logged (we don't need to go fancy on checking exception.getCause() recursively).\nI think what Nick is suggesting is to catch the specific subclass of IOException that is thrown if shutdown() fails.  If we do that, instead of logging the exception and test failing in masterThread.join(), (any other) exception is propagated to the test runner and test fails. Either way the test is fails and we will have the exception, so I'm fine with the approach. @ndimiduk Correct me if I got you wrong..", "author": "bharathv", "createdAt": "2020-05-14T21:45:01Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyNDA5MTI4MQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyNTcwMDEyMg==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/hbase/pull/1690#discussion_r425700122", "bodyText": "Sounds good, but we can't catch the root cause Exception directly, which in our case is ConnectionClosedException.
