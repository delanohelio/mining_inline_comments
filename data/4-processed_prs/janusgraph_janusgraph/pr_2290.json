The test passed. I could also see fetchResultSet() is called in hasNext() method.\n   @Test\n    public void testHugeGraph() {\n        int maxK = 100, maxI = 1000;\n        for (int k = 0; k < maxK; k++) {\n            for (int i = 0; i < maxI; i++) {\n                tx.addVertex(\"prop\", k * maxI + i);\n                newTx();\n            }\n        }\n\n        List<Object> props = graph.traversal().V().values(\"prop\").toList();\n        assertEquals(maxK * maxI, new HashSet<>(props).size());\n    }\nThat being said, I also observed something weird: when I ran this locally, I put a debug point (in Intellij) on this line (line 456) to check if this line is reachable. Once I saw the debug point reached, I immediately removed the debug point and resumed the application. Then the test case failed because graph.traversal().V().values(\"prop\").toList() returned fewer results than expected. I could always reproduce it; even when I set maxI = 10 (that is, one thousand vertices in total). However, the same test case always passes as long as I don't set a debug point. I tried letting the thread sleep for 1 or more seconds here, but the test case still passes.

After that your resume your debug and go fetching a new page (without actually processing any elements on this page). Basically, calling fetchResultSet() 2 times instead of 1 time.\nThat is why it contains fewer elements (i.e. 1 page fewer elements). Moreover, it's actually can produce more elements (in case you are debugging the last page in multi-page traversal).\nThat said, it's just some debugging problems and not related to the code directly.
