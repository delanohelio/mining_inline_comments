This also carves in Cassandra\n4 support based on 4.0.0-beta-3 which passes almost all tests, but\ndeserves to wait until the next beta before we formalize in any way.", "committedDate": "2020-11-27T04:43:53Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUzMTM4MDYyMQ==", "url": "https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/3318#discussion_r531380621", "bodyText": "Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n            # java_version is used for install and runtime layers of zipkin-elasticsearch6\n          \n          \n            \n            # java_version is used for install and runtime layers of zipkin-cassandra", "author": "codefromthecrypt", "createdAt": "2020-11-27T04:47:42Z", "path": "docker/test-images/zipkin-cassandra/Dockerfile", "diffHunk": "@@ -12,10 +12,12 @@\n # the License.\n #\n \n-# java_version is used for install and runtime layers of zipkin-cassandra\n+# java_version is used for install and runtime layers of zipkin-elasticsearch6", "originalCommit": "0b2ac92c403ce5e8f808cd2138de50298b8b50fe", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "5f4095adc08429dcb5deb0ff727d67e89c4bac59", "url": "https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/commit/5f4095adc08429dcb5deb0ff727d67e89c4bac59", "message": "Update docker/test-images/zipkin-cassandra/Dockerfile", "committedDate": "2020-11-27T04:47:46Z", "type": "commit"}]}
