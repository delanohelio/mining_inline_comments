Again, I can't see any real benefit, without an apparence of control: the need is to rise an Exception when the user try to evaluate a PMML that is not present in the classloader, and this is already in place. With this declarative approach we would only create a more complex matrix of possible error conditions to manage.\nLast note about the getOrCreate logic:\nthis works only if the users put the PMML file inside the project . If there is not such PMML file, the model won't be compiled, and then the issue won't be hided. On the other side, if such file is present in the project, I'm expecting user to have put it willingly.\nIf the user put both a kjar and a PMML file in the project, there is anyway a log telling him/her if the model has been loaded or compiled, and this is done on a per-file base", "author": "gitgabrio", "createdAt": "2020-06-05T07:50:01Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzNTQyMTU4MA=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzNTQyMTY3OA==", "url": "https://github.com/kiegroup/drools/pull/2936#discussion_r435421678", "bodyText": "Same as above", "author": "danielezonca", "createdAt": "2020-06-04T17:19:57Z", "path": "kie-pmml-new/kie-pmml-evaluator/kie-pmml-evaluator-assembler/src/main/java/org/kie/pmml/evaluator/assembler/service/PMMLAssemblerService.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -77,7 +95,11 @@ public void addResource(Object kbuilder, Resource resource, ResourceType type, R\n         if (isBuildFromMaven()) {\n             addModels(kbuilderImpl, getKiePMMLModelsFromResourceFromPlugin(kbuilderImpl, resource));\n         } else {\n-            addModels(kbuilderImpl, getKiePMMLModelsFromResource(kbuilderImpl, resource));\n+            List<KiePMMLModel> toAdd = getKiePMMLModelsLoadedFromResource(kbuilderImpl, resource);\n+            if (toAdd.isEmpty()) {\n+                toAdd = getKiePMMLModelsCompiledFromResource(kbuilderImpl, resource);\n+            }\n+            addModels(kbuilderImpl, toAdd);", "originalCommit": "0310b667ce6c8f6cc92720c750d9d61558494338", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}]}
