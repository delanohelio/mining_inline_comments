The short answer is no. DirectPath is designed for clients calling from GCE VM directly, so we actually require that the client need to use the default service account provided by VM itself (see InstantiatingGrpcChannelProvider). If user uses other type of credentials (e.g. set GOOGLE_APPLICATIONS_CREDENTIALS with a key file and run client from outside of GCP), then the client would just use CFE path instead of DirectPath.\nFor testing purpose, I defined this directpath_test_scenario property to differentiate three cases that could happen when client opts in to use DirectPath: 1) client is using DP over IPv4, 2) client is using DP over IPv6 and 3) client uses CFE instead.

So our original idea is, the DirectPath is a network side feature, it should be agnostic to the end users. Currently we add this shouldAttemptDirectPath temporarily so our test can start exercising DirectPath. Once DirectPath is going public, we will remove these temporary checker and set the client to use DirectPath by default. And correct me if I'm wrong, this SpannerOptions seems like a configurable option provided to end users, but in fact we don't actually want users to config DirectPath attempt, which should only be controlled by service owner/SREs via Access Control List.

I don't know what is best here, but I imagine that it might be confusing if the user executes their program with the property set and a custom channel provider, but do not get the benefits of the direct path.\n\nThanks!", "author": "thiagotnunes", "createdAt": "2020-08-28T03:12:17Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ3NzczNjQxMw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ3ODgxODkzOQ==", "url": "https://github.com/googleapis/java-spanner/pull/396#discussion_r478818939", "bodyText": "Good questions! To answer them:\nActually we would need to remove these temporary checker and enable DirectPath with a client lib release before we engage real customers, because DirectPath should be fully controlled by the ACL config (i.e. initially only a few customers will get ALLOW from ACL check, all others will get DENY). So this property set should only be used by our tests.\nThis sandbox endpoint is only used for our testing purposes (as right now DirectPath-ipv4 is only available in certain cell in prod) Once we've done enough tests and DirectPath is fully ready, Spanner will make its default endpoint to be capable of handling DirectPath traffic.
