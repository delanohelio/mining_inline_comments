An entry like 111.222.333.444, 127.0.0.1 on the other hand would  indicate that the proxy is doing something seriously wrong, possibly messing up the order of the proxies in the comma-separated list. In which case the practice of trusting the header as the source of the true ip address should be discontinued.\nI will also remind everybody in that guide section, that allowing localhost connections to bypass authentication for admin calls is also optional and configurable.
