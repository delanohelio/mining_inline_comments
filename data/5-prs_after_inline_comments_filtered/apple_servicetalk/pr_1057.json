This is invalid usage as\ndescribed by the API but there are issues that suggest this may be\noccurring [1][2][3] and if it does we should avoid infinite looping.\n\n[1] https://github.com/apple/servicetalk/issues/744\n[2] https://github.com/apple/servicetalk/issues/1040\n[3] https://github.com/apple/servicetalk/issues/1053\n\nModifications:\n- Rename CancellableThenSubscription to\nDelayedCancellableThenSubscription\n- Leverage DelayedCancellable and DelayedSubscription existing code to\nconstruct DelayedCancellableThenSubscription to share code and lower\ncomplexity\n\nResult:\nDelayedCancellableThenSubscription prevents infinite loops. This may\nimpact the following operators:\n- Single#flatMapPublisher(..)\n- Completable#concat(Publisher)\n- Single#concat(Publisher)", "committedDate": "2020-05-15T19:42:38Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "6c3bfb4a7cc2ecd93bbb7c6bf266aa0e414d8468", "url": "https://github.com/apple/servicetalk/commit/6c3bfb4a7cc2ecd93bbb7c6bf266aa0e414d8468", "message": "make tests more forgiving with invalid requestn matching", "committedDate": "2020-05-15T19:51:59Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyNjc5Mjc0NA==", "url": "https://github.com/apple/servicetalk/pull/1057#discussion_r426792744", "bodyText": "Is this useful anywhere else but for the concat case?\nCan the switch between cancellable and subscription be local to DelayedCancellableThenSubscription?", "author": "NiteshKant", "createdAt": "2020-05-18T17:42:56Z", "path": "servicetalk-concurrent-internal/src/main/java/io/servicetalk/concurrent/internal/DelayedCancellable.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -52,4 +52,12 @@ public void cancel() {\n             oldCancellable.cancel();\n         }\n     }\n+\n+    /**\n+     * Dereference the internal {@link Cancellable} and prevent future calls to\n+     * {@link #delayedCancellable(Cancellable)}.\n+     */\n+    protected final void disableCancellable() {", "originalCommit": "6c3bfb4a7cc2ecd93bbb7c6bf266aa0e414d8468", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyNzY4Mzk3NQ==", "url": "https://github.com/apple/servicetalk/pull/1057#discussion_r427683975", "bodyText": "DelayedCancellableThenSubscription is the only consumer of this API.\nOptions to accomplish dereference:\n\nDelayedCancellable#cancel() - this may involve additional offloading and complicates the control flow a bit.\nDelayedCancellable#disableCancellable - adds extra protected method to the API.
