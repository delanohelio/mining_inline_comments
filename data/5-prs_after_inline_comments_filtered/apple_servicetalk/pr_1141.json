Because a client is\nnot aware that the server intends to close the connection, it may send a\nfollowing request on the same connection before it reads the response.\nIn this case, TCP stack on the server-side will respond with RST frame\n(because the `Channel` is already closed) that may erase data on the\nconnection that were delivered to the client but not acknowledged.\nSee https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-6.6 for more information.\n\nModifications:\n\n- When the request is read swap the `HttpRequestDecoder` with a handler\nthat discards all new incoming requests;\n- When response is written half-close the output side of the connection;\n- When the FIN is received from the client, close the `Channel`;\n- For SSL connections send `close_notify` before `shutdownOutput()`;\n- Save the original `CloseEvent` and use it later to produce more accurate\nlogs for connection closure;\n- Update `RequestResponseCloseHandlerTest` to account for a new state\nmachine;\n- Enhance `GracefulConnectionClosureHandlingTest` to test the same\nscenarios when graceful closure is initiated on the server-side;\n- Add `ServerGracefulConnectionClosureHandlingTest` that reproduces\n`Connection reset by peer` issue described in `Motivation` section;\n- Minor improvements for `ConnectionCloseHeaderHandlingTest` to align it\nwith other tests;\n\nResult:\n\nServer does to cause `Connection reset by peer` exception when it closes\ngracefully or adds `Connection: close` header.", "committedDate": "2020-09-04T03:36:11Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "552f03ce079801862db091691f622721d6a3dccf", "url": "https://github.com/apple/servicetalk/commit/552f03ce079801862db091691f622721d6a3dccf", "message": "Account for the case when the server input shutdowns before output shutdown", "committedDate": "2020-09-09T00:03:12Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "93c526cf271dbc3a761106d4dd5b527a7843c244", "url": "https://github.com/apple/servicetalk/commit/93c526cf271dbc3a761106d4dd5b527a7843c244", "message": "Do not half-close INBOUND (reset) on graceful server closure", "committedDate": "2020-09-09T18:07:26Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "e86d5fe1bfd7d1c36018753b15512f2b127c5ed4", "url": "https://github.com/apple/servicetalk/commit/e86d5fe1bfd7d1c36018753b15512f2b127c5ed4", "message": "Merge remote-tracking branch 'upstream/main' into server-graceful-closure", "committedDate": "2020-09-09T18:08:57Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "da9727cc3bc3e2897e89eb27a2b254cdd8b6db30", "url": "https://github.com/apple/servicetalk/commit/da9727cc3bc3e2897e89eb27a2b254cdd8b6db30", "message": "Use `pending == MAX_VALUE` instead of `CLOSING_SERVER_GRACEFULLY`", "committedDate": "2020-09-09T23:12:00Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "f8041c0e0226a1ca53725106358f203624ab078a", "url": "https://github.com/apple/servicetalk/commit/f8041c0e0226a1ca53725106358f203624ab078a", "message": "Remove leftover Thread.dumpStack()", "committedDate": "2020-09-09T23:12:16Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "72c7d110fcd833bfb3851c5d207b627c0801b310", "url": "https://github.com/apple/servicetalk/commit/72c7d110fcd833bfb3851c5d207b627c0801b310", "message": "RequestResponseCloseHandlerTest: use IS event instead of implicit invocation of h.channelClosedInbound", "committedDate": "2020-09-10T18:53:03Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "7e1a5b26670c2ee4ddec82f5ed5745ce3c5fb14e", "url": "https://github.com/apple/servicetalk/commit/7e1a5b26670c2ee4ddec82f5ed5745ce3c5fb14e", "message": "Add tests to verify that read cancellation does not break graceful server shutdown", "committedDate": "2020-09-10T18:54:26Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "836df80c0b28dcff25cd9c2640931ac29427645c", "url": "https://github.com/apple/servicetalk/commit/836df80c0b28dcff25cd9c2640931ac29427645c", "message": "Revert \"Use `pending == MAX_VALUE` instead of `CLOSING_SERVER_GRACEFULLY`\"\n\nThis reverts commit da9727cc3bc3e2897e89eb27a2b254cdd8b6db30.", "committedDate": "2020-09-10T20:29:11Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "4b789912c8411893ee580c7e2150081ffee36815", "url": "https://github.com/apple/servicetalk/commit/4b789912c8411893ee580c7e2150081ffee36815", "message": "Fire UserEvent instead of registering a handler to discard inbound", "committedDate": "2020-09-10T22:20:29Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "347624b97ca711e19ec7b19522bfe4f284e0e0cd", "url": "https://github.com/apple/servicetalk/commit/347624b97ca711e19ec7b19522bfe4f284e0e0cd", "message": "Implement toString for all `NettyUserEvent`s", "committedDate": "2020-09-14T17:06:24Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "5c5b41c32b1f9dd3947bd44042f2f810e0698188", "url": "https://github.com/apple/servicetalk/commit/5c5b41c32b1f9dd3947bd44042f2f810e0698188", "message": "Do not abort server write if connection is in closing state\n\nServer may register a write after HttpRequestDecoder is already processed\nthe request with \"Connection: close\" header.
