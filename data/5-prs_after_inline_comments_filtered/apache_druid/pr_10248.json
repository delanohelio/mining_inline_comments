This is because unknown would only happen from string dimension indexers of the incremental index which ultimately always produce string columns with a dictionary, and these handlers this method are making are used for things like index merging, etc, and so could safely treat unknown from the dim indexer as true because it wants the desired state rather than the current state.\nNot going to do in this PR, but I am trying to plan out how to refactor ColumnCapabilitiesImpl into a builder that requires a coercion logic to build into a ColumnCapabilities, and changing ColumnCapabilities back to having only boolean, instead of the Capable enum. The idea being to limit the surface area of having to deal with unknown to where is absolutely necessary, because it makes things overly complex to have to deal with these tri-state booleans everywhere.", "author": "clintropolis", "createdAt": "2020-08-11T00:29:26Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2Njg0Mjg3OQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2ODI3MDI4Mg==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/10248#discussion_r468270282", "bodyText": "This is because unknown would only happen from string dimension indexers of the incremental index which ultimately always produce string columns with a dictionary, and these handlers this method are making are used for things like index merging, etc, and so could safely treat unknown from the dim indexer as true because it wants the desired state rather than the current state.\n\nThanks for explaining it. This sounds brittle for the following reason:\n\nAt the call site here, the check really does mean to require a dictionary.\nSo logically it should treat unknowns as false (to be safe \u2014\u00a0if it's not sure if a dictionary exists, and it requires one, then it should fail the check).\nBut it sounds like there are cases where an unknown will appear, and we \"know\" that it is really meant to be a true. So we need to treat unknowns as OK instead of not OK.\n\nBut what if a new case appears in a future patch that isn't (3)? Then this check is too lax. And because the new case is likely to come from a new call site of getHandlerFromCapabilities, whoever adds it will probably not realize they need to update the check here.\nSo instead, would it work to keep the check strict, and resolving unknowns to trues at the current call sites? Then, if a new caller is added, it'd have to deal with the ambiguity.", "author": "gianm", "createdAt": "2020-08-11T01:13:32Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2Njg0Mjg3OQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2ODM1MzA3Mw==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/10248#discussion_r468353073", "bodyText": "I changed the check back to the stricter check, and added more explicit calls to snapshot method around the callers of this method where necessary (which caught one I was mistakenly coercing out of band with CoerceLogic).", "author": "clintropolis", "createdAt": "2020-08-11T06:25:36Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2Njg0Mjg3OQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2ODc2NzUxNg==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/10248#discussion_r468767516", "bodyText": "which caught one I was mistakenly coercing out of band with CoerceLogic\n\nThe system works!!", "author": "gianm", "createdAt": "2020-08-11T18:05:29Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2Njg0Mjg3OQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2Njg1MDc3OQ==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/10248#discussion_r466850779", "bodyText": "ColumnCapabilities is a more typical return value (the Impl is an impl but we should generally return an interface).", "author": "gianm", "createdAt": "2020-08-07T06:40:43Z", "path": "processing/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/segment/DimensionIndexer.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -236,6 +237,7 @@ DimensionSelector makeDimensionSelector(\n       IncrementalIndex.DimensionDesc desc\n   );\n \n+  ColumnCapabilitiesImpl getColumnCapabilities();", "originalCommit": "9fffcd58695a516072b9274bd05fc90a9109c5a3", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2NzM1MTY2Nw==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/10248#discussion_r467351667", "bodyText": "changed many places to use ColumnCapabilities instead of ColumnCapabilitiesImpl, since they are no longer set from multiple places", "author": "clintropolis", "createdAt": "2020-08-08T02:43:41Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2Njg1MDc3OQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2Njg1MTY1OA==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/10248#discussion_r466851658", "bodyText": "Can this be private?
