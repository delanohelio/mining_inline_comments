Let me clarify my understanding: I understand your timeline as \"table A read checks lock and still has it, but lock expires just afterwards\". With that:\nBefore my change the behavior would be to not throw: when A does the read, it checks the lock, then user does some reads from a cache (AtlasDB is not aware of those reads), and then user calls commit. Then #hasReads is true (because of the A read) so we recheck PreCommitCondition, but #validationNecessaryForInvolvedTablesOnCommit returns false, because #isValidationNecessaryOnCommit checks !validateLocksOnReads. And validateLocksOnReads is a preeety deep rabbit hole, but if you follow it it ultimately is set from TransactionManagers#validateLocksOnReads where the default is true.\nAfter my change, hasReads is true, so again we check PreCommitCondition, and then anyTableRequiresImmutableTimestampLocking is true, because I'm assuming that's what your example does, !validateLocksOnReads is false, but !hasReads() is true, so we do it. I guess I could add a recheck for !hasReads() && hasAnyInvolvedTables() just to be nice?\nUltimately, I think what I care about most is the PreCommitCondition check: the immutable timestamp lock, as you say, is just for TargetedSweep to not nuke the cells under us, but we kinda don't care (because we have them in-memory!). So if you think this is just too complicated I can ignore, but I think I'd rather have this behave roughly the same as the case of only cache reads (the only difference is that the immutable lock check will be checked at commit time).", "author": "jkozlowski", "createdAt": "2020-09-17T06:23:32Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4OTQ4NjY5Nw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5MDA2MTQ4MQ==", "url": "https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/4968#discussion_r490061481", "bodyText": "In my post when I meant \"original\" I meant \"before lock watches even exist\", so the operation is reading A and then reading B - i.e. my concern is about the difference between\nuser reads table A, checks lock\n<loses immutable timestamp lock>\nuser reads table B without notifications (because they don't exist), checks lock, fails\n\nand\nuser reads table A, checks lock\n<loses immutable timestamp lock>\nuser reads table B via notifications, marked B as used\ntxn.commit()\n\nYep, I think the thing I wanted to verify was that this is only for sweep protection, which I believe is correct - if that's the case then I'm pretty sure this is fine", "author": "jeremyk-91", "createdAt": "2020-09-17T08:23:02Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4OTQ4NjY5Nw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5MDE0NjYyNw==", "url": "https://github.com/palantir/atlasdb/pull/4968#discussion_r490146627", "bodyText": "Yep, discussed offline.
