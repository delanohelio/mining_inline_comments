On the lhs, KSequence children have an expected sort of\nKItem because they have to match on a cons list, however, because of the\ncons list append operation, children on the rhs can be of sort K. This\nwas causing an error where we filtered out all possible sorts and were\nunable to assign a sort to parametric productions that appeared under a\nKSequence on the RHS. Now we correctly assign sort K in these cases.", "committedDate": "2020-02-25T17:52:51Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "635af3afa527fee289ca302ca9949f880376c288", "url": "https://github.com/kframework/k/commit/635af3afa527fee289ca302ca9949f880376c288", "message": "Merge branch 'master' into lub", "committedDate": "2020-02-25T20:50:54Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4NDExOTMzMw==", "url": "https://github.com/kframework/k/pull/1119#discussion_r384119333", "bodyText": "The name of this function looks funny to me.
