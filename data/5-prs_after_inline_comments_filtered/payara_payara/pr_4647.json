That is part of the reason for the chosen solution.\nGenerally it seems reasonable for an invocation to only assume two instances being equal when a == b as they basically represent a call stack element. However, callers themselves only reacting to events have trouble to pass the very same instance of the invocation to both pre- and post as those originate from different execution stacks. The point where those are within one method is either too far up or does not even exist when originating from scheduled executions of working events.\nGiven this the question becomes: how do we know the pre/post invocation instance represent the same stack element? If == is no option equals is the next reasonable choice. WebComponentInvocation are always constructed from a WebModule and possibly an instance. Being more strict here is better since behaviour before was ==.", "author": "jbee", "createdAt": "2020-05-04T08:29:04Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQxOTE0MjYxNQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQxOTI2Mjg3Mg==", "url": "https://github.com/payara/Payara/pull/4647#discussion_r419262872", "bodyText": "I don't like mixing OR and AND operators.
