What if the token expires for second time? The lock will be still in session attributes from previous iteration.\n\nYou mean the lock-object? Yes, when the token expires again, the same instance of the lock will be reused. So, we do not need to set the \"lock-attribute\" again as long as the user's session is not invalidated. When the user's session is invalidated, the lock will be removed. Or am I wrong?\n\nAlso replication in cluster will have some latency, is it or isn't it a problem? (probably it isn't)\n\nObject itself does not have any fields that need to be transferred. So there shouldn't be a huge impact on latency. Although I haven't measured that ;-)\n\nI know raw Object is not Serializable. I do not remember perfectly, but I do wonder what happens at HttpSession passivation... Or if session migrates to other VM...\n\nGood point, haven't thought about that. Yes, Object is not Serializable, so passivation or replication will fail. Will change the lock to an \"empty\" implementation of Serializable.\n\nI don't say it is incorrect, I am only asking ;-)\n\nI appreciate your feedback :-)", "author": "parysto", "createdAt": "2020-02-09T10:59:18Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3Njc2Njk0OA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4MTI0MjIxNg==", "url": "https://github.com/payara/Payara/pull/4419#discussion_r381242216", "bodyText": "@pzygielo I think I investigated in years ago when I was fixing SSO session replication and I found that nonserializable objects are simply ignored if there is no special implementation for them.", "author": "dmatej", "createdAt": "2020-02-19T11:47:25Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3Njc2Njk0OA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4MTI1OTEyMw==", "url": "https://github.com/payara/Payara/pull/4419#discussion_r381259123", "bodyText": "@dmatej thanks for checking\n\nI think I investigated in years ago when I was fixing SSO session replication and I found that nonserializable objects are simply ignored if there is no special implementation for them.\n\nHowever it's not so clear for me, given section 7.7.2 of Servlet 4.0 spec, and:\n\nThe distributed servlet container must throw an IllegalArgumentException for\nobjects where the container cannot support the mechanism necessary for migration\nof the session storing them.\n\nthus I'm not so sure about simply ignoring such session attributes.
