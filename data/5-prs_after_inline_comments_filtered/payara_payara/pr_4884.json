This module has then been modified to\nincorporate the new API - which is implemented in a custom example\nmodule as well as the new log notifier.\n\nThe notifiers can now be referenced by name rather than via a core enum.\nThis makes them more modular as services like the request tracing\nservice can discover the notifiers via HK2, and not through a centrally\nregistered enum.\n\nNotifications can now be sent programmatically through HK2 topics.\n\nNotifiers without any configuration can now be implemented, which\nallows dynamic notifiers to be created by users. There is also now much\nless boilerplate required to implement new services, as each notifier\nlistens for the same event type. No factories are required to be\nimplemented by the API user.\n\nThe notification get commands have also been improved to better discover\nthe notifier names, and to print better information when used from the\nconsole.\n\nIssues left to solve:\n - Some dynamic flags may not work\n - Notifier lifecycles aren't fully controlled (when are the initialize\nmethods called?\n - Performance hasn't been tested\n - No queues or thread pools are implemented for notifiers\n - Exceptions aren't handled in notifiers\n - Hasn't been tested in a clustered setup\n\nSigned-off-by: Matthew Gill <matthew.gill@live.co.uk>", "committedDate": "2020-09-08T10:17:20Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "f95d3dfb4a7702e08b9191567e1c9e44487d440f", "url": "https://github.com/payara/Payara/commit/f95d3dfb4a7702e08b9191567e1c9e44487d440f", "message": "FISH-315 Add Thread Pooling to Notifiers\n\nRedesigned the notification loop to use the PayaraExecutorService.

So your concern was that working a single notifier in its entirety could delay working the other notifiers later in the sequence.\nSo what I suggested was more of a round robin. Forget the NotifierHandler class exist. Think that in the service you have a list of notifiers and a (generic) queue of messages to deliver. The method called periodically has a loop that runs until the queue is empty. It pulls one message from the queue and forwards it to each notifier that should receive it. This way all notifier will always see the first message before any can see the second which can be said is quite fair. On the downside a notifier that is very slow in its message processing will slow down message processing for all other notifiers. A problem the current loop has as well just in another form.\nWhich brings me back to what I thought initially the solution was - that each notifier would have its own queue and its own scheduled task. As this would solve \"stalling\" messages for other notifiers. Each would in their task method try to send all messages of the queue. Now the notifiers compete for CPU and co but given we want messages going through the system as fast as possible this is a good thing. But we still might delay message processing because of the scheduling. This makes me think: why do we use scheduled tasks when it can be event-reaction that are asynchronously coupled by a queue.\nI think what we want is:\n\nthe thread creating a message to be send should not be delayed\nnotifiers do not affect each other message delivery\nmessages are delivered as promptly as possible\nmessages are delivered in order they are handed to the service (for each notifier)\n\nWith this in mind I think a queue already decouples a message source from sending the message so the scheduling is just causing unnecessary delay and work. The message processor or processors should just block wait on the queue. A solution that has all the qualities above is a bit more complicated.\n[Edit: realised it can be simpler, changed the text below]\n\nSource puts the message in each receiving notifiers individual queue (via service)\neach notifier specific queue has a own thread block wait - when it awakens from the message offered to the queue it pulls it and forwards the message to the notifier.\nnotifier does its notifier specific thing\n\nOnly downside I see here is that this needs n worker threads for n notifier types. But they mostly be waiting.\nAlso the number of actually enabled and receiving notifiers is low. So if this is build so that the thread for a notifier is only spawned if there is actually a message for that notifier and it is enabled I think this is a good way to meet all the qualities we want.", "author": "jbee", "createdAt": "2020-09-18T15:38:17Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4NzgxODg1NA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5MTkxMDI4Mw==", "url": "https://github.com/payara/Payara/pull/4884#discussion_r491910283", "bodyText": "I've created a thread for each notifier that runs with a 5ms delay but waits on the queue to fill up - I hope this addresses the threading problems!", "author": "MattGill98", "createdAt": "2020-09-21T09:40:22Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4NzgxODg1NA=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "d03f03a32374361f4dfc328cea39415211873d4c", "url": "https://github.com/payara/Payara/commit/d03f03a32374361f4dfc328cea39415211873d4c", "message": "FISH-315 Prevent Duplicate Notifiers Enabled\n\nCurrently the log notifier can be enabled repeatedly, meaning the\ndomain.xml fills up with log notifier blocks.
