There's no universal rule when this makes sense and when it doesn't. And there are too many options on how things can be handled.\nThere is large ommision in the TCK not giving out enough negative testcases, and taskcases that would clean confusion around trimming, empty values and so forth. But I think current wording does not give us the freedom to do more things in the stardard converter. There are tests for primitive converters, which do expect IllegalArgumentException to be thrown, just as javadoc of Converter  suggests.\nI see that this behavior is expected in realm classes above, but I think it would be more secure to just extend your nice resolver API, where collection methods would have methods to specify:\n\nTo trim value before converting\nTo ignore some parsing errors (or all parsing errors returning empty collection)\nTo allow empty values (as nulls), to skip them, or to throw errors.", "author": "pdudits", "createdAt": "2020-06-29T13:42:34Z", "path": "nucleus/payara-modules/nucleus-microprofile/config-service/src/main/java/fish/payara/nucleus/microprofile/config/converters/ArrayConverter.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,121 @@\n+/*\n+ * DO NOT ALTER OR REMOVE COPYRIGHT NOTICES OR THIS HEADER.\n+ *\n+ * Copyright (c) 2020 Payara Foundation and/or its affiliates.
