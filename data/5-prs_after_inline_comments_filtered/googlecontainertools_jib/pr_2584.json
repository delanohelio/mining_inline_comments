That is, considering the nature of the method name \"add\", I think it makes sense to always add a new platform.\nAt the same time, I'd like to have amd64/linux as the default. We can clearly document in the Javadoc of addPlatform() something along the line of saying \"note that the build plan starts with amd64/linux as the default platform. If you want to reset the default platform instead of adding a new one, use setPlatforms()\" or something like that.\nAnd I remember we had a discussion about handling duplicate values. I think we can take care of it easily if we use Set<Platform> instead of List<Platform>. And this behavior should also be documented. (For an actual Set implementation, we want to choose LinkedHashSet instead of, e.g., HashSet in order to preserve the element order.) But just using Set doesn't automatically make it remove duplicates, because Java will always think one Platform instance is different from another instance even if their OS and arch values are same. We need to tell Java that two different Platform instances are essentially \"equal\" if their internal values are same. To do so, you need to implement Platform.equals() and Platform.hashCode().
