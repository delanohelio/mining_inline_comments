If the stream is already closed then invoking this method has no effect.\n\nWe do implement safe close method in SubqueryIterator and this method is automatically called when we read last element from elementIterator, so, I'm not sure why we are forcing CloseableIterator to be used everywhere even so it should be used just in a couple of places.\nCould be great to hear some thoughts about it.", "author": "porunov", "createdAt": "2020-12-06T20:32:34Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5MTgwMDk2MA=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "50251d59fbde80624b23168fa86391609559e7a7", "url": "https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/commit/50251d59fbde80624b23168fa86391609559e7a7", "message": "Fix SubqueryIterator close bug\n\nThis makes SubqueryIterator, LimitAdjustingIterator, and\nResultSetIterator implement CloseableIterator, and makes\nsure SubqueryIterator finishes properly.\n\nFixes #2217\n\nSigned-off-by: Boxuan Li <liboxuan@connect.hku.hk>", "committedDate": "2020-09-26T07:11:33Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"oid": "70a4da19f659d4e319d4d4d9f1d8cb0f5f8b06d1", "url": "https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/commit/70a4da19f659d4e319d4d4d9f1d8cb0f5f8b06d1", "message": "Fix SubqueryIterator close bug\n\nThis makes SubqueryIterator, LimitAdjustingIterator, and\nResultSetIterator implement CloseableIterator, and makes\nsure SubqueryIterator finishes properly.\n\nFixes #2217\n\nSigned-off-by: Boxuan Li <liboxuan@connect.hku.hk>", "committedDate": "2020-09-21T01:09:00Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5NTk3MjY0Mw==", "url": "https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/pull/2218#discussion_r495972643", "bodyText": "I didn't spend much time checking the logic behind this class but from the first glance both solutions look error prone to me.\nThe first solution binds the logic to hasNext to add new elements to the cache (no one said that hasNext should always be executed before next or close methods, thus the solution is error prone).\nA new solution binds logic to close method which might be a little bit better but still looks error prone to me (if we don't call close method at all).\nI think it would be more correct to bind that logic to next method because only next method is responsible for retrieving new elements.

I'm just thinking if we can somehow reuse already existent general functionality instead of introducing our own implementation and then support it.\nI know we have #2033 but I don't see it to be resolved anytime soon. Thus, I think, in case we don't have better alternatives for some functionality, it's okay to use that functionality from Guava.\nFor example, Guava already has this concat functionality in Iterators.

I'm not sure yet. Maybe it is a correct implementation but for me it's a little bit confusing.\nMy confusion is that it's not clear, when exactly we trigger close for CloseableIterator. Looking in this PR I see that some Iterators automatically trigger close after the last element they read but some Iterators don't trigger this logic and expect external logic to trigger close for them (like LimitAdjustingIterator).\nI need to look at this PR a little bit more deeply. I have a small feeling that we can remove our concat implementation and if each Iterator which implements CloseableIterator would close itself automatically, then we don't need to pass CloseableIterator iterator everywhere and we don't need to wrap Iterator as CloseableIterator when it doesn't have anything to close.

It only refactors iterators on\nthe traversal -> SubqueryIterator chain so that traversal.close()\ncan be delegated.\n2. Refactor all iterators using computeNext method. Some iterators have\ncomplex internal logic thus I would like to leave them as they are\nin this commit. Generally, all iterators using nextInternal method\ncould be rewritten using computeNext which is much cleaner and\navoids eager-computing (fetches the first result in the constructor).\n\nFixes #2217\n\nSigned-off-by: Boxuan Li <liboxuan@connect.hku.hk>", "committedDate": "2020-12-03T01:59:45Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"oid": "fe145a5576ebcc844b70ca182d719f19fc05e7b6", "url": "https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/commit/fe145a5576ebcc844b70ca182d719f19fc05e7b6", "message": "Reduce wrappings of iterators to closable iterators\n\nSigned-off-by: Oleksandr Porunov <alexandr.porunov@gmail.com>", "committedDate": "2020-12-20T21:27:41Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"oid": "267f18987b2b4605fe21572451e3e7854e492056", "url": "https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/commit/267f18987b2b4605fe21572451e3e7854e492056", "message": "Reduce wrappings of iterators to closable iterators\n\nSigned-off-by: Oleksandr Porunov <alexandr.porunov@gmail.com>", "committedDate": "2020-12-20T21:34:12Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"oid": "4a7db78cdbe9cea61966ff98a716d67249218877", "url": "https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/commit/4a7db78cdbe9cea61966ff98a716d67249218877", "message": "Reduce wrappings of iterators to closable iterators\n\nSigned-off-by: Oleksandr Porunov <alexandr.porunov@gmail.com>", "committedDate": "2020-12-20T21:37:55Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"oid": "166c22ba97ebf5589aa87baa642b035e7d846ec8", "url": "https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/commit/166c22ba97ebf5589aa87baa642b035e7d846ec8", "message": "Reduce wrappings of iterators to closable iterators\n\nSigned-off-by: Oleksandr Porunov <alexandr.porunov@gmail.com>", "committedDate": "2020-12-20T21:57:31Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "166c22ba97ebf5589aa87baa642b035e7d846ec8", "url": "https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/commit/166c22ba97ebf5589aa87baa642b035e7d846ec8", "message": "Reduce wrappings of iterators to closable iterators\n\nSigned-off-by: Oleksandr Porunov <alexandr.porunov@gmail.com>", "committedDate": "2020-12-20T21:57:31Z", "type": "forcePushed"}]}
