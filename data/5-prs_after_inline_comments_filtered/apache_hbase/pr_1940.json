And they invoke the same method, that's why we can use NONE directly.\nIt makes sense to allow Hbase users to set the storage strategy corresponding to the Hfile/WAL directory, because most users may not be familiar with how to operate the heterogeneous commands of HDFS\nHowever, if the default value stored in Hfile is still HOT, there will be potential semantic conflicts. HDFS managers and Hbase users may not know this default setting and will not modify it, but it actually changes HDFS Storage strategy.\nThis is a omission point of HBASE-20691, It only modified the default policy of WAL, but forgot to modify Hfile.\n\nTBH, it's' a legacy issue to decide if we should avoid/ban setStoragePolicy() in Hbase, seems that keeping the status quo has the least impact now (ban the whole reflect API for HDFS should be done in a separate patch)", "author": "imbajin", "createdAt": "2020-06-21T06:36:53Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0MzE3NzcyMQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}]}
