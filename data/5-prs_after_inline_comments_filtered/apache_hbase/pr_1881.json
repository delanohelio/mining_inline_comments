When this area is called by that flow, we can preserve what is there today (Passing true).  Close time ya lets honor the config.  Sounds ok?\nIdeally speaking we should have handled whole these in another way. Within the Cache implementation, the evict by hfile would have been an async impl. So the caller wont get blocked.
