The corresponding AuthorizationBean contains permissions which contain a RequesterBean which contains a UserModel (the requester). Now, without this change, the ftl-template cannot be rendered correctly, because permission.requester.username is null in this line: \n  \n    \n      keycloak/themes/src/main/resources/theme/base/account/resource-detail.ftl\n    \n    \n         Line 121\n      in\n      3d5e976\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n        \n          \n           <form action=\"${url.getResourceGrant(authorization.resource.id)}\" name=\"revokeForm-${authorization.resource.id}-${permission.requester.username}\" method=\"post\"> \n        \n    \n  \n\n\nAnd the reason it's null is because this refers to the method getUsername on the UserModel- but it doesn't exist for FTL as default methods don't exist for without this change (this is due to the JavaBean specification which doesn't understand default methods).\nNow, clearly that's just one instance of where this fails as the UserModel is also present in other beans. Also, since get/setUsername are not default implemented anymore this particular issue will not arise anymore, but the same problem will be whenever we need get/setEmail or firstName, lastName.\nSo for me, there would be several solutions to this:\n\ndirectly grab the attribute of the user in the FTL templates via something like permission.requester.attributes[\"username\"][0] or similar. This is not very nice and very error prone as I don't see a good way to find all instances where this could be a problem. Also, this breaks custom templates.\nAdd the configuration option as above: least intrusive from a code perspective which is why I proposed this change first, but may have unwanted side-effects. I've never really worked with FTL, so I can't say much about it\nRemove the default methods and just implement them on all subclasses. Since we do essentially the same for getUsername it seems those subclasses aren't too many due to the hierarchy of subclasses.\nAdd a wrapper object to all places where UserModel is used in the beans. Sounds weird and error prone and results in quite a few changes\nAdd an abstract subclass of UserModel and derive all classes that don't override the default methods from this subclass: I don't particularly like to add yet another level to the hierarchy, it's already quite deep\nMake UserModel an abstract class instead of an interface (I haven't tested it though): This should also work, but may not be nice from an architectural standpoint.\n\nI'm probably going to try out the third option.
