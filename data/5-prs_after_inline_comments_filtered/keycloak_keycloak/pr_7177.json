The browserStrictCookies property just tells us the browser treats cookies in some way and doesn't tell us when they'll be blocked. It's up to the test to know it.\nAlso, when the tests fail without setting proper hosts for server, it's actually correct behavior IMHO. It points out a miscofigured test.\nBut I agree maybe we could add a special Maven profile to set hosts to some precofigured values. But I'm not sure about it \u2013\u00a0if we want to hardcode a 3rd party services directly into POM.
