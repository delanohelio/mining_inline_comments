I think going forward I may need to rename .build. to .builder. everywhere if .build. continues to be a problem. I propose to discuss it further on dev.\nI was quite keen to avoid the typical .builder. in the package name but I may have to reconsider, I'm certainly looking forward to discussing it further", "author": "sberyozkin", "createdAt": "2020-12-14T21:57:11Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0MjY0MzYyMw=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}]}
