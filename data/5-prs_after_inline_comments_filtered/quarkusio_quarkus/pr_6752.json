So it is clean and nice. Now, if this build item is removed, then for me to implement the optimization idea I had in mind I'd have to basically collapse everything (but a single step involving the Tika-common resources) into a single build step (generate the config, optionally load PDF/OOXML specific resources).\nI appreciate a build item is great for coordinating between different extensions, but in this case it would help the tika processor keep the parser specific build steps separate, keeping the native optimization in mind.
