Therefore, I\nremoving the condition dealing with the first element of the list and\nuse the fact that I know that it is the first element.\n\nBy itself it should be a really really small improvement. However, it\nallows to simplify the code and eventually to add great improvement\ninto it.", "committedDate": "2020-06-24T11:42:45Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "cdb7f416c674ca2ec7703ab6082f414cbd1c6b82", "url": "https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/commit/cdb7f416c674ca2ec7703ab6082f414cbd1c6b82", "message": "Regression Test: multiple children at same level\n\nadding two decks with multiple children has at the same level.
