There is almost always a way to have the \"main\" tree be \"clean\" (but maybe more flexible, so you can inject test settings) without having actual test-related code in here.\nIn this instance, perhaps you could sub-class CollectionHelper as TestCollectionHelper in the \"test\" class hierarchy and override the method, then use the TestCollectionHelper to do the same - this is a common and easy pattern", "author": "mikehardy", "createdAt": "2020-04-15T21:08:34Z", "path": "AnkiDroid/src/main/java/com/ichi2/anki/CollectionHelper.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -116,6 +119,10 @@ public synchronized Collection getCol(Context context) {\n         return mCollection;\n     }\n \n+    public void setTest() {", "originalCommit": "02bde3959ea01444ed611300da80c41bdda50cf1", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwOTEzNzc1NA==", "url": "https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/pull/6020#discussion_r409137754", "bodyText": "Another idea I had would be to allow a string parameter for the folder name.
