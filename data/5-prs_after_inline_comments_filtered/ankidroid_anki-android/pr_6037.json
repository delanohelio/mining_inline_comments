It seems like a semantic difference unless I'm reading it wrong?\nIt used to be:\nCASE1 - if (cid != 0 && cid != -1) -> a review was undone\nCASE2 - else if (cid != -1) -> reset and get new card\nThat combination means \"reset and get new card\" will happen for all cid where cid is anything but 0 or -1\nNow it is\nCASE1 if (cid == 0) -> reset and get new card\nCASE2 if (cid != 1) -> a review was undone\nNow it is only doing a reset and get new card if cid == 0.
