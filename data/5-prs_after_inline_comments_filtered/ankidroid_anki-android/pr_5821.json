Is it every possible for that to happen?\nI've been fixing crash bugs a lot, and some are weird corner cases, so I want to make sure. A more defensive structure might be to get idealIvl and adjRevIvl first (outside of try/catch) so we have existing behavior at least as a fallback, then inside the try/catch you could try to fetch the _revConf and do the Math.min to adjust the value, logging if there is a problem but not crashing.
