So you might have a second test structure next to the TEST_DECKS definition that is TEST_DECKS_DUE_TREE, and then you would have some assertions that what you got from calling getCol().getSched().deckDueTree() matches your expected results. There examples of matchers being used in the src/main/test code all over and the API we're using mostly is http://hamcrest.org/JavaHamcrest/ so maybe since I don't see a reflective deep-object-comparator there you would make a few assertions about the shape of the deck due tree when it came back, like how many entries, at what level etc, or you could write a quick 'DeckDueTree' comparator and ask Hamcrest to use it", "author": "mikehardy", "createdAt": "2020-06-24T19:37:54Z", "path": "AnkiDroid/src/test/java/com/ichi2/libanki/sched/SchedTest.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -124,6 +125,15 @@ private void selectNewDeck() {\n         getCol().getDecks().select(did);\n     }\n \n+    @Test\n+    public void ensureDeckTree() {\n+        for (String deckName: TEST_DECKS) {\n+            addDeck(deckName);\n+        }\n+        getCol().getSched().deckDueTree();", "originalCommit": "a849661b5bc957d2e7c7484dcc15307e20754fb7", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0NTE4NDc4Nw==", "url": "https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/pull/6548#discussion_r445184787", "bodyText": "The main problem I have is that I don't know what I can expect to already exists.

To do it in a general way implies likely implementing equals (which transitively implies overriding hashcode https://stackoverflow.com/a/8180483/9910298 ) and would bring in a separate need to add tests etc to make sure that code itself was correct in case .equals (which is generally available on java's base Object) is used anywhere", "author": "mikehardy", "createdAt": "2020-06-25T20:46:09Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0NTEyNjM3OQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "a757f3a7bcbc1f78dbc70975c49a0463ddaf935f", "url": "https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/commit/a757f3a7bcbc1f78dbc70975c49a0463ddaf935f", "message": "Test detecting #6544\n\nThis test fails with the PR that was wrong.
