But that means there would be 2 separate factory types. One for NotificationService - currently only email but in the future could be something else like push messages to phone - and another for providers such as AWS SES, or some SMS messages provider.\nThe providers and types of Notification Services are coupled as there is no reason to Instantiate a NotificationService of one type (for example, EmailNotificationService) with a provider from another type (for example, some push notifications Provider).\nSo I've decided on using a single factory. Implementors can implement other factories that create EmailNotificationService with a different provider of their own or create a different type of NotificationService all together with its own providers.", "author": "OferLevi85", "createdAt": "2020-02-22T10:09:49Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4MjcwNDcxMg=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4MjcwNTI0NA==", "url": "https://github.com/AthenZ/athenz/pull/884#discussion_r382705244", "bodyText": "Since creating MIMEMessage is common across diff email providers, it can be extracted in the EmailProvider implementation as default method", "author": "abvaidya", "createdAt": "2020-02-21T17:18:34Z", "path": "libs/java/server_common/src/main/java/com/yahoo/athenz/common/server/notification/impl/AWSEmailProvider.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,116 @@\n+package com.yahoo.athenz.common.server.notification.impl;\n+\n+import com.amazonaws.regions.Region;\n+import com.amazonaws.regions.Regions;\n+import com.amazonaws.services.simpleemail.AmazonSimpleEmailService;\n+import com.amazonaws.services.simpleemail.AmazonSimpleEmailServiceClientBuilder;\n+import com.amazonaws.services.simpleemail.model.RawMessage;\n+import com.amazonaws.services.simpleemail.model.SendRawEmailRequest;\n+import com.amazonaws.services.simpleemail.model.SendRawEmailResult;\n+import com.yahoo.athenz.common.server.notification.EmailProvider;\n+import org.slf4j.Logger;\n+import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;\n+\n+import javax.mail.Session;\n+import javax.mail.internet.InternetAddress;\n+import javax.mail.internet.MimeBodyPart;\n+import javax.mail.internet.MimeMessage;\n+import javax.mail.internet.MimeMultipart;\n+import java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream;\n+import java.nio.ByteBuffer;\n+import java.util.Collection;\n+import java.util.Properties;\n+\n+import static com.yahoo.athenz.common.server.notification.NotificationServiceConstants.CHARSET_UTF_8;\n+import static com.yahoo.athenz.common.server.notification.NotificationServiceConstants.HTML_LOGO_CID_PLACEHOLDER;\n+\n+public class AWSEmailProvider implements EmailProvider {\n+    private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(AWSEmailProvider.class);\n+    private final AmazonSimpleEmailService ses;\n+\n+    @Override\n+    public boolean sendEmail(String subject, String body, boolean status, Collection<String> recipients, String from, byte[] logoImage) {\n+        try {\n+            Session session = Session.getDefaultInstance(new Properties());", "originalCommit": "1969289ad57d57019d8362713e9afce9546e59b3", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4MjkwMjEzNg==", "url": "https://github.com/AthenZ/athenz/pull/884#discussion_r382902136", "bodyText": "Yes I'm planning on doing it in the next couple of pull requests.
