I thought that the extra operation is acceptable as the first check that compares characters is already quite expensive and it won't make a noticeable difference. Readability seemed like the bigger concern so I tried to minimize the number of return statements in the function (as mentioned in \"Code Complete\"). If this extra operation is expensive though, instead of calling System.currentTimeMiils() in each iteration, I can get the current time as a parameter so it will only be calculated once (this will also have some effect on readability).

Take a look at that class's millis implementation (if it hasn't been done before, it actually parses the full string to get a date object and then returns the getTime method - not that efficient so we should try to avoid that as much as possible. if you want to minimize the return statements then you can just combine the values with && in the return - the jdk should optimize the call and not call the second part of the && if the first is already false - something like:\nboolean isUser = roleMember.getMemberName().startsWith(userDomainPrefix);\nreturn (isUser && ((roleMember.getExpiration() == null) || (roleMember.getExpiration().millis() > System.currentTimeMillis())));", "author": "havetisyan", "createdAt": "2020-02-10T21:44:37Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3NzIwMjE0Nw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3NzM0OTgxNw==", "url": "https://github.com/AthenZ/athenz/pull/878#discussion_r377349817", "bodyText": "I wasn't aware of the work done in the rdl to get normalizedMillis.
