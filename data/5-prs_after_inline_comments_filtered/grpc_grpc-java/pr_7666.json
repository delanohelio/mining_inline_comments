It is for ordering the filters in a filter chain based on the attributes of the channel such as IP address and port (both local and remote). So the Comparator is used to rank the filters in the filter chain to find the best match for the given channel e.g. An exact IP address match is better than a match with IP_any (0.0.0.0). Admittedly we don't need a complex Comparator to achieve this and a simple scoring based algorithm would have worked but the reviewer wanted it.\nSince the Comparator just ranks the filters in the chain we still need to make sure the top ranked filter fits the current channel which is where the comparator.isMatching() is made on the bestMatch.", "author": "sanjaypujare", "createdAt": "2020-11-26T00:38:02Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUzMDY5ODI5Mw=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}]}
