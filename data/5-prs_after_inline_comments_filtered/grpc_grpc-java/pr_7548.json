As I understand the code here, instead any call with keep-open in the metadata essentially flips a global boolean and all calls from that point on will be kept open (at least until another RPC comes without keep-open). Is that intended?\nTo set a value that would instead be scoped to this particular call, I think you could set a value in the context, as in https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/traffic-director-grpc-examples/blob/master/java/src/main/java/io/grpc/examples/wallet/WalletInterceptors.java#L106 (there might be a better way to accomplish this)", "author": "ericgribkoff", "createdAt": "2020-10-24T06:14:09Z", "path": "interop-testing/src/main/java/io/grpc/testing/integration/XdsTestServer.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -203,18 +214,22 @@ public void setNotServing(\n     }\n   }\n \n-  private static class HostnameInterceptor implements ServerInterceptor {\n+  private static class TestInfoInterceptor implements ServerInterceptor {\n     private final String host;\n+    private final AtomicBoolean keepOpenCaptor;\n \n-    private HostnameInterceptor(String host) {\n+    private TestInfoInterceptor(String host, AtomicBoolean keepOpenCaptor) {\n       this.host = host;\n+      this.keepOpenCaptor = keepOpenCaptor;\n     }\n \n     @Override\n     public <ReqT, RespT> ServerCall.Listener<ReqT> interceptCall(\n         ServerCall<ReqT, RespT> call,\n         final Metadata requestHeaders,\n         ServerCallHandler<ReqT, RespT> next) {\n+      String callBehavior = requestHeaders.get(CALL_BEHAVIOR_KEY);\n+      keepOpenCaptor.set(\"keep-open\".equals(callBehavior));", "originalCommit": "de84e5afdbcb03029ae5ef0b410ba6aadec19a9b", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxMTM2NDMzNQ==", "url": "https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/pull/7548#discussion_r511364335", "bodyText": "Oops, you are right.
