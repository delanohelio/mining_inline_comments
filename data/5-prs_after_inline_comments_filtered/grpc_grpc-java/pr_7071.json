When it was converted to disableAutoRequestWithInitial() the behavior was changed; to match the old behavior it should have used disableAutoRequestWithInitial(1) but it did disableAutoRequestWithInitial(0) instead. This was done due to a misunderstanding of the previous behavior.\nIf the RPC is already ready at this point, will onReady be called? The API isn't required to. The API says it is called when transitioning from false to true; so you technically have to have seen isReady() == false before onReady() is guaranteed.\nThat said, I do know this code currently works without the initial request(), because onReady is called unnecessarily. But I don't want to encourage depending on that behavior.", "author": "ejona86", "createdAt": "2020-05-28T21:07:17Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzMTk5NDE4NA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzMjY3MTE1Nw==", "url": "https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/pull/7071#discussion_r432671157", "bodyText": "Oh, I'm wrong.
