Some exposure is required and we have to find a middle-ground. The auto-configuration that exists today can only go so far and does a pretty good job of recreating a needed flow without really knowing anything else about its other neighboring modules but it can only do so much. At some point and for advanced use cases, a deployer would need to physically figure out the flow execution order.\nThe order property is meant to be exposed in configuration settings. It's just not done yet, because there has been no need to. We could pick sensible default values but no default value could ever address all scenarios and managing it all as the developer community is unnecessary burden coupled with the fact that we don't have the manpower or the tests to verify all different combinations of webflow modules when they are wired together in any order (also gotta remember this for any new thing we develop). So the middle-ground is, allow the auto-configuration of webflows to be configurable yet do not require it. Pick default values as cas developers to make sure things work out of the box as much as possible, and let deployers choose or modify a value if they ever have the need to, because the defaults can only go so far when you have 5 modules declared in the build and all wish to modify the webflow in some weird way. Otherwise, (and back to my earlier example), any sort of change to the webflow execution order to account for a use case or behavior would require changes to the source code, hours and weeks of diagnosis and testing, a patch release and a month's delay at best. That is not a workflow a CAS deployer might find attractive, when they could just flip a setting to change 1 to a 2.", "author": "mmoayyed", "createdAt": "2020-02-11T13:04:35Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3NzU3NjU3Mg=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3NzYyMjQwNA==", "url": "https://github.com/apereo/cas/pull/4690#discussion_r377622404", "bodyText": "OK.
