So if some FAT bucket does:\npublic static GenericContainer myContainer = new GenericContainer(\"someImage:1.0\");\nWhen the substitutor is activated the code will effectively be:\npublic static GenericContainer myContainer = new GenericContainer(\"com.mycompany.registry/someImage:1.0\");\nWhere com.mycompany.registry is a companies private docker registry (ideally a mirror of Docker Hub). I've set up a mirror registry within the IBM network to handle this. A registry mirror is basically a lazily-populated cache. If a bucket does a pull of a new image someImage:1.0, the mirror will check to see if it's available within the mirror, and if not it'll download the image from Docker Hub and cache it for future use. So that way the next time we do a pull of someImage:1.0 it comes from the mirror registry and we don't need to touch Docker Hub, thus avoiding the rate limiting issue.\n\nWill developers running tests locally still be able to run against our remote docker machines?\n\nYes. If we detect that remote docker is being used, then the new ExternalTestServiceDockerClient.setupTestcontainers method will rewrite the .testcontainers.properties file to use the ArtifactoryImageNameSubstitutor and it will generate a ~/.docker/config.json with a the private docker registry mirror auth token.", "author": "aguibert", "createdAt": "2020-12-17T00:14:13Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0NDcwOTQzMw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0NTE3NzgwMQ==", "url": "https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/pull/15296#discussion_r545177801", "bodyText": "Okay thanks for that extra explanation! \ud83d\udc4d", "author": "KyleAure", "createdAt": "2020-12-17T15:27:39Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0NDcwOTQzMw=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "7e0a096d72a8bc7a402b9da06f8bb2b3c5dc5a7c", "url": "https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/commit/7e0a096d72a8bc7a402b9da06f8bb2b3c5dc5a7c", "message": "Fixes to various FATs after upgrading to Testcontainers 1.15.0", "committedDate": "2020-12-17T22:20:17Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"oid": "c33a778f776a86137fa817e5c70ccf93f3cd261d", "url": "https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/commit/c33a778f776a86137fa817e5c70ccf93f3cd261d", "message": "Fixes to various FATs after upgrading to Testcontainers 1.15.0", "committedDate": "2020-12-19T05:21:27Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"oid": "400a584b17cb2bc128936f337f74179f023844e4", "url": "https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/commit/400a584b17cb2bc128936f337f74179f023844e4", "message": "Upgrade to Testcontainers 1.15.0", "committedDate": "2020-12-19T05:25:08Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "58fb7acc261515dcfa65499c3c0485285dc0a9b9", "url": "https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/commit/58fb7acc261515dcfa65499c3c0485285dc0a9b9", "message": "Update FAT projects to use maven central mirror", "committedDate": "2020-12-19T05:25:09Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "ba581668965fcc06e6cd19f15c868f7b91a808b2", "url": "https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/commit/ba581668965fcc06e6cd19f15c868f7b91a808b2", "message": "Use private DockerHub mirror via ImageNameSubstitutor", "committedDate": "2020-12-19T05:25:09Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "c4d2dd86fcf39ff14ab7eab4f1dd1aaf41a1a10c", "url": "https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/commit/c4d2dd86fcf39ff14ab7eab4f1dd1aaf41a1a10c", "message": "Always use local docker for GH Actions", "committedDate": "2020-12-19T05:25:09Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "695b6da97f4f7068d44f5bc5ff1304728af2df97", "url": "https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/commit/695b6da97f4f7068d44f5bc5ff1304728af2df97", "message": "Update cloudant_fat to use static image", "committedDate": "2020-12-19T05:25:09Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "6a79dbc955db742e84e081f6ecad142dabcd7bb5", "url": "https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/commit/6a79dbc955db742e84e081f6ecad142dabcd7bb5", "message": "Use static image for couchdb_fat", "committedDate": "2020-12-19T05:25:10Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "411aa85082ec2fff154fdd6a610a30e0a39f6f2b", "url": "https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/commit/411aa85082ec2fff154fdd6a610a30e0a39f6f2b", "message": "Get auth token for custom docker config", "committedDate": "2020-12-19T05:25:10Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "02c9a660516561b66c257965c5328e2855aef224", "url": "https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/commit/02c9a660516561b66c257965c5328e2855aef224", "message": "Pull private registry token from Consul", "committedDate": "2020-12-19T05:25:10Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "aaa84ec9da6215ab057b6813239cca6f9d73d24f", "url": "https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/commit/aaa84ec9da6215ab057b6813239cca6f9d73d24f", "message": "Fixes to various FATs after upgrading to Testcontainers 1.15.0", "committedDate": "2020-12-19T05:25:10Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "aaa84ec9da6215ab057b6813239cca6f9d73d24f", "url": "https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/commit/aaa84ec9da6215ab057b6813239cca6f9d73d24f", "message": "Fixes to various FATs after upgrading to Testcontainers 1.15.0", "committedDate": "2020-12-19T05:25:10Z", "type": "forcePushed"}]}
