If lowActivity is true, then getGrowScore returns 0 and forceVariation will not grow the pool. The effect of lowActivity on shrink decisions is much more subtle - a nudge to increase shrinkScore in some cases.\n\n\nWe don't have to worry about lowActivity pushing the pool size below currentMinimumPoolSize because that is prevented by checks in adjustPoolSize.\n\n\nThe example you gave will never arise, because poolDecrement will always be no greater than Math.floor(25% of pool size).\n\n\nFor example, say cpus=2 - then coreThreads is 4 and poolIncrement/Decrement is 2\nSo if poolSize=12, then activeThreads < 9 (8 or lower) would help set lowActivity, but dropping 2 threads from 12 leaves 10, which is 2 above activeThreads.\nThings are closer on the first increment - if poolSize=6 then activeThreads has to be 4 or lower for lowActivity to be set, and a poolDecrement of 2 is still safe\n\n\nTo overcome any concern about shrinking below activeThreads, it is probably a good idea to add it as a limit to shrinking in adjustPoolSize:\n     if (poolAdjustment < 0 && newPoolSize >= Math.max(currentMinimumPoolSize,activeThreads) {\n\n\n\nThat would protect us against unexpected behavior if the various system properties have been manually configured in such a way that poolDecrement might be greater than 25% of poolSize.\nThe thing that I like about 75% is that it provides a very general flag that \"hey the pool is really not very busy at the moment\" which is a good clue that the controller really should not grow the pool, even randomly, and should think about maybe shrinking it. :-)", "author": "gjdeval", "createdAt": "2020-05-06T14:39:49Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQxOTU2NzY0NA=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQxOTU3ODQyMQ==", "url": "https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/pull/11770#discussion_r419578421", "bodyText": "warnings are translated messages.
