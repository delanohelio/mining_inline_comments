Looks like above is not the case. TransactionRecord.transferList contains all transfers.

The insertCryptoCreateTransferList() normalizes the transfer list to include an entry for zero initial balance because the record.transferList does not include such an entry. record.transferList only includes an entry for initial balance if it's non-zero. Technically it doesn't check for zero directly but for any missing transfers for the created account, so this may also have been necessary for some past bug in transfer list generation.\nEither way, I don't think we should change it as I'm not sure how this logic is depended upon.
