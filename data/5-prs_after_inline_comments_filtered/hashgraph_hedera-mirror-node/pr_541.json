Caching the non-existence of an entity would introduce additional delays to being able to subscribe after create and risk causing further issues with when to invalidate the cache.\nCaching with Flux is a bit more complex than I thought. Spring does not support @Cacheable with Flux, so you have to use reactor-extra with its CacheMono and a cache library like Caffeine.\nAfter attempting it, I found that it does cache the non-existence of entities in addition to existence. I'm not sure how to tweak it to not do that, so don't think I can do this recommendation at this time.", "author": "steven-sheehy", "createdAt": "2020-02-19T01:45:06Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4MDkyODgxNg=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4MTQzMDMxMQ==", "url": "https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-mirror-node/pull/541#discussion_r381430311", "bodyText": "Sounds good, brings in too many uncertainties so we can explore this another time.
