Removing the column.\n- No need of 2-part insert using f_file_create/complete.\n  Just checking for presense on file start and inserting row on file complete is sufficient.\n- Earlier, fk_rec_file_id was foreign key, so many tests for transactions needed to added\n  a row to t_record_files. That foreign key was dropped recently, so update tests to remove chaff.\n- Changes in REST code are limited to tests\n\nBRD uses t_record_files table to simulate blocks internally. So we can't just remove it.\nWe have two possible options going forward:\n1. Remove t_record_files tables. We have no regular need of finding which file a txn belongs to.\nIf needed for debugging, one can use txn's epoch datetime and do prefix ls on S3.\nWill need to understand how BRD uses t_record_files and if it is just as easy to simulate blocks\nusing t_transactions.\n2. If we keep the table around, to support lookup of all txns associated with a file, we can add\ntwo columns filled by consensus timestamps of first and last transaction in the file.\n\nSigned-off-by: Apekshit Sharma <apekshit.sharma@hedera.com>", "committedDate": "2020-03-13T19:02:38Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "af2728b6eaeea7454430298d73e2876693e0a68b", "url": "https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-mirror-node/commit/af2728b6eaeea7454430298d73e2876693e0a68b", "message": "fix rest tests\n\nSigned-off-by: Apekshit Sharma <apekshit.sharma@hedera.com>", "committedDate": "2020-03-13T19:06:29Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "af2728b6eaeea7454430298d73e2876693e0a68b", "url": "https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-mirror-node/commit/af2728b6eaeea7454430298d73e2876693e0a68b", "message": "fix rest tests\n\nSigned-off-by: Apekshit Sharma <apekshit.sharma@hedera.com>", "committedDate": "2020-03-13T19:06:29Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5MjQxODAwNA==", "url": "https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-mirror-node/pull/600#discussion_r392418004", "bodyText": "We shouldn't remove the id, it is useful for replication and may be useful to third parties.
