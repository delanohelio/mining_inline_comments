The best we tend to have (IMO) is the 'coco pharma' environment which a) is coherent and b) I know is being used by others even to test clients against and c) is how I test much of the release currently .The master template I used for this was generally the coco pharma notebook diagrams.  I also accept that a test is quite different to a tutorial - the requirement is more just 'I can run it'.\nIn the notebooks, both cocoMDS1 and cocoMDS4 are on the 'data lake' omag server platform. Under 'common' the default URL for the data lake platform is defined as dataLakePlatformURL  = os.environ.get('dataLakePlatformURL', 'https://localhost:9444') - hence why the default setting.\nSo this means at least if running a comparable coco setup locally, the FVT's will 'just work' - a placeholder for further automation\nFrom a search I couldn't find explicit use of the coco servers/platforms in the postman collections/environment for the dojo. Geared towards a developer role it's a more manual approach. The reason for changing the test above is if it looks like coco, and smells like coco, it is coco ;-)\nIn #426 I've been looking at options to automate - I plan to create a new PR (on 2.1+) for that, which will require changing the parm handling here to accept input parms (in addition) - for a single server environment, which is IMO quite different to coco pharma. Along with this we'll add docs, and this would superceded any change similar to this", "author": "planetf1", "createdAt": "2020-06-30T12:34:19Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0NzYxMjE3MA=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}]}
