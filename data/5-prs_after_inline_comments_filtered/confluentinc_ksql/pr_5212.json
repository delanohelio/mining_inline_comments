Seems normally for an internal endpoint to have a different port. And wouldn't that cause a port clash on startup?\n\nI explained this much better when talking with Tim in comments.   In practice, we want the ksql.advertised.listener to refer to the thing bound by ksql.internal.listener, since this advertising is only for inter-node internal requests.  Even if we wanted to call an existing, publicly facing endpoint, I think it's useful to differentiate where it's coming from and actually create an internal version of the endpoint (which can of course, delegate to the same logic, if necessary).  The alternative is to have a ksql.advertised.listener and ksql.advertised.internal.listener, but this seems overly complex and would not accomplish the differentiation.\nksql.advertised.listener is just a way of explicitly stating whatever is already listened on, it doesn't actually bind any ports, so there should be no port clash.  ksql.internal.listener is more analogous to listeners.  If those are set to the same port, it will attempt to do the combined setup.\nI can see my description is poor.  Let me take another try at it.\n\n\nIf set, the internal endpoints don't use authentication.\n\nAside from the questionable English ;), the internal endpoints should definitely support authentication, otherwise its a security hole. It should be possible to configure that auth differently to the main endpoint.
