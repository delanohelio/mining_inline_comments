When the consume side closes the query, e.g. on an `EOFException` if the user has closed the connection, the query first closes the queue; setting a flag the producers are checking on each loop; causing any producers to exit the loop. Then it can safely close the KS topology.", "committedDate": "2020-01-13T17:25:50Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM2NTk1MzY0NA==", "url": "https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/pull/4297#discussion_r365953644", "bodyText": "nit: the name makes it sound like a it's a queue of queries, not a blocking queue for a query. thoughts on BlockingEventQueue or BlockingRowQueue (a queue that fills up with events/rows)?", "author": "agavra", "createdAt": "2020-01-13T18:18:50Z", "path": "ksql-engine/src/main/java/io/confluent/ksql/query/BlockingQueryQueue.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,60 @@\n+/*\n+ * Copyright 2020 Confluent Inc.\n+ *\n+ * Licensed under the Confluent Community License (the \"License\"); you may not use\n+ * this file except in compliance with the License.
