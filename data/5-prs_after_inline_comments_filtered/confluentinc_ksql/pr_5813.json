One is logistically if external repos depend on a removed enum they can't just \"add it in\" and keep going (which you can if you depended on a removed string constant). Second is a little bit more philosophical, you shouldn't remove an enum because it changes the ordinals of everything after it - which I've been bit by before (though unlikely it'll fall into play here). I think JSON schema might actually fail compatibility checks if you removed an enum from a schema (not that we use json schema yet...)\n\nAnd by \"extending\" here, do you mean adding new values ?\n\nyeah", "author": "agavra", "createdAt": "2020-07-14T03:24:17Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ1Mzk0NjQyOA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ1NDA4NzkzMg==", "url": "https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/pull/5813#discussion_r454087932", "bodyText": "got it, that makes sense. thanks for taking the time to share!", "author": "blueedgenick", "createdAt": "2020-07-14T04:11:15Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ1Mzk0NjQyOA=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "50adb7ff006868a864bbfd8b2336bb6a36dc10a2", "url": "https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/commit/50adb7ff006868a864bbfd8b2336bb6a36dc10a2", "message": "initial version", "committedDate": "2020-07-14T18:29:23Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "3452336935970324083b9769acbbb1206deb7f96", "url": "https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/commit/3452336935970324083b9769acbbb1206deb7f96", "message": "docs", "committedDate": "2020-07-14T18:29:23Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "8db9dc346775d377d3828e5dd69ce839dc4cebc0", "url": "https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/commit/8db9dc346775d377d3828e5dd69ce839dc4cebc0", "message": "fix docs typo", "committedDate": "2020-07-14T18:29:23Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "5189085554e01c5f200feb6dc085b7d8c4a51d19", "url": "https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/commit/5189085554e01c5f200feb6dc085b7d8c4a51d19", "message": "missed a couple of 'final's", "committedDate": "2020-07-14T18:29:23Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "34d90372bdcf0b02106c4210d0e05dda4892514b", "url": "https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/commit/34d90372bdcf0b02106c4210d0e05dda4892514b", "message": "retry integration test fix", "committedDate": "2020-07-14T18:37:41Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "1efb7a1244d7271ce73f27c41e023abb2547e13c", "url": "https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/commit/1efb7a1244d7271ce73f27c41e023abb2547e13c", "message": "Almog's requested changes", "committedDate": "2020-07-14T18:37:41Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "436397a7f0cf01c3b9b70d4e2ce03469ddb297a6", "url": "https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/commit/436397a7f0cf01c3b9b70d4e2ce03469ddb297a6", "message": "checkstyle", "committedDate": "2020-07-14T18:37:41Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "0efb17ba234378ee243af403bb076713dedfd943", "url": "https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/commit/0efb17ba234378ee243af403bb076713dedfd943", "message": "more rules", "committedDate": "2020-07-14T18:37:41Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "351a6c1ef86a9205a83f00018003ea822f4f24c9", "url": "https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/commit/351a6c1ef86a9205a83f00018003ea822f4f24c9", "message": "fix copy/paste error", "committedDate": "2020-07-14T18:37:41Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "065e4dd218e4ae9727907fa2f79fd85984f13d77", "url": "https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/commit/065e4dd218e4ae9727907fa2f79fd85984f13d77", "message": "fix fallout from switching to static strings", "committedDate": "2020-07-14T19:52:58Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "065e4dd218e4ae9727907fa2f79fd85984f13d77", "url": "https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/commit/065e4dd218e4ae9727907fa2f79fd85984f13d77", "message": "fix fallout from switching to static strings", "committedDate": "2020-07-14T19:52:58Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"oid": "718e937851fea1742a8f888781d528e160282036", "url": "https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/commit/718e937851fea1742a8f888781d528e160282036", "message": "missed one more typo", "committedDate": "2020-07-14T22:04:55Z", "type": "commit"}]}
