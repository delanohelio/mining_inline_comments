Is it a portable extension?  Is it many?  Is it a bean archive?  How are they defined?  What granularity do they have?  Why this extension?  What happens if I add another extension in this package?\nWhy must they be registered in a static singleton?  Why must they be pushed?  Why must this coupling be tight?  Suppose HelidonFeatures grows and becomes complicated and the static call in the static initializer fails and this class doesn't load.  Is it straightforward to debug?\nSo far this is the only compile-time io.helidon dependency in all of the integrations we have on anything outside of the integrations area.  Everything else is pure MicroProfile dependencies.  These integrations have proven to be separate from the rest of Helidon because of course they are runtime components that can be deployed, or not, as people see fit, within any MicroProfile application.  I personally would like to keep it this way.\nCDI has an event mechanism for broadcasting things of interest that facilitates loose coupling (yay) rather than tight coupling (boo).  It seems to me that any Helidon features facility should be built on top of it (at least in the CDI/MicroProfile area) since the extension in this case doesn't care.  Perhaps extensions could simply do event.fire(this) on the initialization of the application scope and then some collector in the Helidon-specific container could sort out how to make features out of this.\nAnyway those are some that I can think of right now.", "author": "ljnelson", "createdAt": "2020-03-13T18:31:20Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5MTMwNTE4Nw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5MjQxNjM3NQ==", "url": "https://github.com/oracle/helidon/pull/1478#discussion_r392416375", "bodyText": "The HelidonFeatures needs to be re-worked, but, this is a must have for all components.
