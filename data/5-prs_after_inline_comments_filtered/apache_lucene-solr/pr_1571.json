same format ( I wouldn't add a special field name different from [interleaing], this would complicate evaluators behaviours.\nThis means that in the end I guess we need to keep a special name to indicate the original ranking, and this name can't be used by the admin for any other model.\nGiven that, do you think is still beneficial to have a separate parameter?\nOr just using the original approach, with the documented exclusivity of a special name, would look cleaner?", "author": "alessandrobenedetti", "createdAt": "2020-09-28T21:31:07Z", "replyToReviewId":

"bodyText": "Ah, good point about the special \"OriginalRanking\" also appearing in the \"[interleaving]\" transformer!\nWhen using interleaving there's always at least two models to be interleaved, right?\nThe models could all be actual models or one of them could be the \"OriginalRanking\" pseudo-model.\nI wonder if class inheritance might help us e.g.\nclass InterleavingLTRQParserPlugin extends LTRQParserPlugin\n\nand (say)\n<queryParser name=\"ltr\" class=\"org.apache.solr.ltr.search.LTRQParserPlugin\"/>\n<queryParser name=\"iltr\" class=\"org.apache.solr.ltr.search.InterleavingLTRQParserPlugin\"/>\n\nwhere\nrq={!iltr model=myModelXYZ}\n\ncan be a convenience equivalent to\nrq={!iltr model=OriginalRanking model=myModelXYZ}\n\ni.e. if only one model is supplied then it is implied that the second model is the original ranking.\nAnd if the special \"OriginalRanking\" name doesn't suit someone (either because they already have a real model that happens to be called \"OriginalRanking\" or because they would prefer a different descriptor in the \"[interleaving]\" transformer output) then something like\nrq={!iltr originalRankingModel=noModel model=noModel model=someModel}\n\nwould allow them to call the \"OriginalRanking\" something else e.g. \"noModel\" instead.\nWe could even reject any \"OriginalRanking\" models that are actual models via something like\nfinal String originalRankingModelName = localParams.get(\"originalRankingModel\", \"OriginalRanking\" /* default */);\nif (null != mr.getModel(originalRankingModelName)) {\n  throw new SolrException(SolrException.ErrorCode.BAD_REQUEST,\n                          \"Found an actual '\" + originalRankingModelName + \"' model, please ...\n}\n\n\nHowever, the \"[interleaving]\" transformer still needs to know about the special name, hmm.\nAt the moment we have\npublic static boolean isOriginalRanking(LTRScoringQuery rerankingQuery){\n  return rerankingQuery.getScoringModel() == null;\n}\n\nin LTRQParserPlugin and in LTRInterleavingTransformerFactory\nif (isOriginalRanking(rerankingQuery)) {\n  doc.addField(name, ORIGINAL_RANKING);\n} else {\n  doc.addField(name, rerankingQuery.getScoringModel().getName());\n}\n\nand if we gave LTRScoringQuery a getScoringModelName method\npublic String getScoringModelName() {\n  return ltrScoringModel.getName();\n}\n\nthen in LTRInterleavingTransformerFactory we could have\ndoc.addField(name, rerankingQuery.getScoringModelName());\n\nif the\nnew LTRScoringQuery(null);\n\nin LTRQParserPlugin becomes\nnew LTRScoringQuery(null) {\n  @Override\n  public String getScoringModelName() {\n    return originalRankingModelName;\n  }\n};\n\nbut that wouldn't displace any other isOriginalRanking(rerankingQuery) calls, though if we had something like\nfinal class OriginalRankingLTRScoringQuery extends LTRScoringQuery {\n  private final String originalRankingModelName;\n  public OriginalRankingLTRScoringQuery(String originalRankingModelName) {\n    super(null /* LTRScoringModel */);\n    this.originalRankingModelName = originalRankingModelName;\n  }\n  @Override\n  public String getScoringModelName() {\n    return this.originalRankingModelName;\n  }\n}\n\nthen (rerankingQuery instanceof OriginalRankingLTRScoringQuery) could replace isOriginalRanking(rerankingQuery) conceptually.\n\nJust thinking out aloud here, haven't yet tried to turn any of the above into code.\nCould you see

"bodyText": "So @cpoerschke , I made a step back with the latest commit, let me explain,\nFirst of all, the approach you detailed can definitely work,\nI don't want to undervalue your effort and contribution, I am actually quite grateful for the time you dedicated in reviewing my proposal, so I really appreciate that.\nBut let's aim to a Keep It Simple Stupid approach here (KISS) and avoid over-complication in a first release, if possible:\n\nApache Solr makes use of \"special names\" in various places :\n\n\nDEFAULT to indicate the default feature/model store\nversion to indicate a meta-field used for versioning/optimistic concurrency\nect\nI notice the prefix and suffix '_' is used for them.\nSo let's use it  : \"OriginalRanking\" could be a fair name to identify the Apache Solr ranking pre-re-ranking.\nI named it after the \"OriginalScore\" feature, already in place, happy to use a different name, but wouldn't spend to much time on it.\nMy proposal would be to use \"OriginalRanking\" or potentially \"OriginalScoreRanking\" if more readable\n\n\n\nthe user interact with the !ltr query parser as usual, and if he/she wants to use interleaving, he/she just passes a second model (yes, we are supporting only 2 interleaved model right now):\nmodel=A model=B\nIf he/she wants to interleave with the original ranking:\nmodel=A model=OriginalRanking\nI think this is quite intuitive and easy to be used, quite explicit and following current Apache Solr nomenclature for special named items\n\n\nwhat happens if a user had/wants to use \"OriginalRanking\" for one of his/her models?\nIn this unlikely event, a Jira issue can be raised and we design a possible solution at that time.\nA possible simple approach could be to make the original ranking name parametric, so the user can specify the name in the solrconfig.xml\nBut I would delay this reasoning only if we get requests for that functionality from users\n\n\nWhat do you think?\nIf we find a good compromise here, we could move the review to the re-scoring part, that is more delicate and we can make sure no mistake happened there (I definitely don't want to slow down normal re-ranking and I definitely want the interleaved re-ranking to be as fast as possible)\nYou find the latest changes in the latest commits, I will update the related documentation as well today.", "author": "alessandrobenedetti",

considerations already annotated I see sort of \"structural extensibility\" type benefits, not sure if that's a good description, let me try to illustrate with two examples:\n\nexample 1: beyond TeamDraftInterleaving: An interleaving algorithm other than TeamDraftInterleaving could be supported like I alluded to in 11.1/n though of course with the existing class structure that would also be possible.\n\n- public LTRInterleavingQuery(LTRInterleavingScoringQuery[] rerankingQueries, int rerankDocs) {\n-     super(null /* scoringQuery */, rerankDocs, new LTRInterleavingRescorer(rerankingQueries));\n+ public LTRInterleavingQuery(LTRInterleavingScoringQuery[] rerankingQueries, int rerankDocs, Interleaving interleavingAlgorithm) {\n+     super(null /* scoringQuery */, rerankDocs, new LTRInterleavingRescorer(rerankingQueries, interleavingAlgorithm));\n\nvs.\n- public LTRQuery(LTRScoringQuery[] rerankingQueries, int rerankDocs) {\n-     super(defaultQuery, rerankDocs, new LTRInterleavingRescorer(rerankingQueries));\n+ public LTRQuery(LTRScoringQuery[] rerankingQueries, int rerankDocs, Interleaving interleavingAlgorithm) {\n+     super(defaultQuery, rerankDocs, new LTRInterleavingRescorer(rerankingQueries, interleavingAlgorithm));\n      this.rerankingQueries = rerankingQueries;\n  }\n\n  public LTRQuery(LTRScoringQuery rerankingQuery, int rerankDocs) {\n      super(defaultQuery, rerankDocs, new LTRRescorer(rerankingQuery));\n      this.rerankingQueries = new LTRScoringQuery[]{rerankingQuery};\n  }\n\nYou'd know better than me what other interleaving algorithms exist and might be interesting for LTR and what sort of parameters they might need from LTRQParserPlugin. One variant of the current TeamDraftInterleaving that I (naively) could see is for the two models to interleave not with the current 50:50 ratio but with (say) a 80:20 ratio.\n\nexample 2: beyond Interleaving: we've got one model, we've got interleaving of two models, might there be other ways of combining models or of rescoring? I don't know what these might be: choose a document only if both models had picked it? choose a document only if at least 2 of 3 models picked it? hmm, maybe those are variants of interleaving. could one model rescore the documents already scored by another model?\n\nanyhow, whatever the shiny new thing is, there'd be an existing LTRQuery/LTRScoringQuery/LTRRescorer + LTRInterleavingQuery/LTRInterleavingScoringQuery/LTRInterleavingRescorer pattern that might be repeated then as LTRShinyNewQuery/LTRShinyNewScoringQuery/LTRShinyNewRescorer and whilst LTRInterleaving* required only the pickedInterleavingDocIds as state within LTR[Interleaving]ScoringQuery perhaps LTRShinyNew* would require something more complex.\n\nWhen you say \"there is a little bit of code we are adding around\" I agree, yes, there's all the methods twice though slightly different then.\n\nIs your concern about the repetition as such and/or about the increase in the LTRQParserPlugin class in which the LTR[Interleaving]Query classes are inner classes?\nIt appears that the inner classes are not but could be static inner classes and therefore it should also be possible to promote them to not be inner classes of LTRQParserPlugin but classes in their own right and that would make LTRQParserPlugin shorter.", "author": "cpoerschke", "createdAt": "2020-11-05T21:05:53Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxNzUxNjQ3NQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxODY5NjY4OA==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/pull/1571#discussion_r518696688", "bodyText": "I didn't like much the bit in the  LTRFeatureLoggerTransformerFactory.java\nLTRInterleavingTransformerFactory.java, but thinking more about it, I don't think is that much of a problem, ad your observations are fair.
