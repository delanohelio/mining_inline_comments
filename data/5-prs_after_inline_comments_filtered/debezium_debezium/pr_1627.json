Just wrapping all access to the streamingSource with synchronization blocks inline in the ChangeEventSourceCoordinator#start and ChangeEventSourceCoordinator#commitOffset methods wouldn\u2019t protect from a race condition between the offset commit and the catch up streaming deactivation by setting streamingSource to null.\nThere are a couple options that I\u2019ve looked at other than using the ReentrantLock:\nA new synchronized function could be added here that handles both the null check and streamingSource.commitOffset(offset) call in ChangeEventSourceCoordinator#commitOffset and the streamingSource = null deactivation in ChangeEventSourceCoordinator#start. Personally, this feels unnecessarily complex and would be difficult to integrate with the other calls to streamingSource.\nOR\nA separate object stored in an instance variable could be use as a lock to synchronize on.\nObject streamingSourceLock = new Object();\n ...\npublic void commitOffset(Map<String, ?> offset) {\n    synchronized (streamingSourceLock) {\n        if (streamingSource != null && offset != null) {\n            streamingSource.commitOffset(offset);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nSince BaseSourceTask has access to the executing ChangeEventSourceCoordinator reference, both threads should synchronize correctly. That said, I feel using a generic Object as a lock is unidiomatic compared to the ReentrantLock and I like the ReentrantLock because it highlights where the race condition might occur.\nThoughts?", "author": "grantcooksey", "createdAt": "2020-06-19T15:32:42Z", "path": "debezium-core/src/main/java/io/debezium/pipeline/ChangeEventSourceCoordinator.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -122,8 +126,23 @@ public ChangeEventSourceCoordinator(OffsetContext previousOffset, ErrorHandler e\n         });\n     }\n \n+    protected CatchUpStreamingResult executeCatchUpStreaming(OffsetContext previousOffset, ChangeEventSourceContext context,\n+                                                             SnapshotChangeEventSource snapshotSource)\n+            throws InterruptedException {\n+        return new CatchUpStreamingResult(false);\n+    }\n+\n+    protected void streamEvents(OffsetContext offsetContext, ChangeEventSourceContext context) throws InterruptedException {\n+        streamingSource = changeEventSourceFactory.getStreamingChangeEventSource(offsetContext);\n+        eventDispatcher.setEventListener(streamingMetrics);\n+        streamingMetrics.connected(true);\n+        LOGGER.info(\"Starting streaming\");\n+        streamingSource.execute(context);\n+        LOGGER.info(\"Finished streaming\");\n+    }\n+\n     public void commitOffset(Map<String, ?> offset) {\n-        if (streamingSource != null && offset != null) {\n+        if (!commitOffsetLock.isLocked() && streamingSource != null && offset != null) {", "originalCommit": "9e476511de3292696d9562182fd8f5c2c26cece5", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0NTgyNzk3MA==", "url": "https://github.com/debezium/debezium/pull/1627#discussion_r445827970", "bodyText": "Getting back to this, now that 1.2 Final is out :)\nGood point, if the object can be set to null, we cannot synchronize on it.
