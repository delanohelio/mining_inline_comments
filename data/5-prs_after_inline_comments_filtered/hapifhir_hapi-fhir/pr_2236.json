This is a pattern that is used in HAPI FHIR a lot, but we're using it less these days as it's very often possible to create a generic provider that handles all versions of FHIR. See BaseJpaSystemProviderDstu2Plus for an example, which supplies the $mark-all-resources-for-reindexing operation to all versions of FHIR.\nThis approach wasn't possible for a long time which is why it's uncommon in HAPI FHIR, but for anything newer I always try to at least question whether what I'm doing could be written in a cross-version way.\nCan these providers work this way?", "author": "jamesagnew", "createdAt": "2020-12-11T23:28:15Z", "path": "hapi-fhir-server-mdm/src/main/java/ca/uhn/fhir/mdm/provider/MdmProviderLoader.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -45,17 +47,30 @@\n \t@Autowired\n \tprivate IMdmSubmitSvc myMdmSubmitSvc;\n \n+\tprivate BaseMdmProvider myMdmProvider;\n+\n \tpublic void loadProvider() {\n \t\tswitch (myFhirContext.getVersion().getVersion()) {\n \t\t\tcase DSTU3:\n-\t\t\t\tmyResourceProviderFactory.addSupplier(() -> new MdmProviderDstu3(myFhirContext, myMdmControllerSvc, myMdmMatchFinderSvc, myMdmExpungeSvc, myMdmSubmitSvc));\n+\t\t\t\tmyResourceProviderFactory.addSupplier(() -> {", "originalCommit": "9ef3f90773c28f7c9335d3356604652b7a3ceb7e", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0MTYxMTQ1OA==", "url": "https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir/pull/2236#discussion_r541611458", "bodyText": "These Providers mostly return Bundles, which appear to be STU-Specific.
