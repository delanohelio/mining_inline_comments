Can you describe to us what these are testing?\nThe reason why I am asking is that for the JUnit 4 to 5 migration we need to figure out for each of these test helpers if they are only used internally within openmrs-core. This one is used in ModuleActivatorTest in org.openmrs.module and WebModuleActivatorTest in `package org.openmrs.web.test;.\nIf it is only used internally we can choose to switch to JUnit 5 without also providing a JUnit 4 version. If it is for example used by module devs we need to provide a JUnit 4 version so they have a transition period. So they can choose to migrate at their own pace.\n@achilep I will wait for @dkayiwa before we make a decision on what to do with this test helper.", "author": "teleivo", "createdAt": "2020-07-16T13:43:13Z", "path": "api/src/test/java/org/openmrs/test/jupiter/BaseModuleActivatorTest.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,56 @@\n+/**\n+ * This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License,\n+ * v. 2.0.
