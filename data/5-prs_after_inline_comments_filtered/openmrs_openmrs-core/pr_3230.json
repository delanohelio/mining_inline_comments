The OpenmrsClassLoader doesn't do any actual loading of its own. Except, in some cases (like the one here), the OpenmrsClassloader does not have enough information in hand to be able to choose the right ModuleClassLoader, and it ends up just choosing an arbitrary one (which of course can be the wrong one). So, in this case, we bypass OpenmrsClassLoader and insert the one ModuleClassLoader that we (as the caller) know to be the right one.", "author": "LeeBreisacher", "createdAt": "2020-06-10T06:39:45Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzNjc0MTk2OQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzODA4ODg0NQ==", "url": "https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-core/pull/3230#discussion_r438088845", "bodyText": "@LeeBreisacher's argument makes sense to me. The OpenmrsClassLoader is not smart enough to chose the appropriate class loader for this particular scenario. And since the calling code already has this context information, which the OpenmrsClassLoader does not have, it looks right for it to set the context class loader. I do not foresee a problem with this, because, after the willRefreshContext callback, before the spring application context is refreshed, the context class loader is set back to the OpenmrsClassLoader. And FWIW, i have run this change for a couple of days with the entire reference application modules and a few extra modules.
