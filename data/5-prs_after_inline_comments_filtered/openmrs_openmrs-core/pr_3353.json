We will need to support JUnit 4 tests for module developers for a while. That is why we sometimes have to duplicate/migrate test helpers (or base classes) like this one so we have a JUnit 4 version for module devs and a JUnit 5 version that we can directly use in openmrs-core. One day when modules have migrated over to JUnit 5 we can remove the JUnit 4 versions.\nI am wondering how this affects the H2DatabaseIT. Is that theoretically only used in openmrs-core? In what openmrs release was it added?\nI am asking so we can either move it to JUnit 5 if thats only internal.\nOr whether we have to provide a JUnit 4 and JUnit 5 version since module developers or others are interested in this class. In that case I would like to know if its ok to move it to package org.openmrs.test since this is where we have the test helpers/base classes like BaseContextSensitiveTest and so on. For JUnit 5 we created a subpackage org.openmrs.test.jupiter where the JUnit 5 versions of lets say BaseContextSensitiveTest are. This is where I would see this H2DatabaseIT in case that has to be supported in JUnit 4 & 5.\nPlease let us know what you think :)\nThanks a lot!", "author": "teleivo", "createdAt": "2020-07-14T13:53:33Z", "path": "api/src/test/java/org/openmrs/util/jupiter/H2DatabaseIT.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,103 @@\n+/**\n+ * This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License,\n+ * v. 2.0.
