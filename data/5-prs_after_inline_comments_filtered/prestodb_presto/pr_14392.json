I think repurposing something is total fine but the exact new definition of the enum Language is unknown to me. Maybe you can clarify this?\n\"If\" this new definition Language still represent the programming language in which a Presto function is implemented, then a user-defined SQL function implemented in \"Java\" should also have a language \"Java\", not \"Hive\". Hive is not language anyway, HQL is, but is not applicable in this context here.\nConsider those 3 categories of function:\n\nA scalar function implemented in Presto or Presto Plugin, using the annotation framework that Presto can understand. (SqlScalarFunction)\nA scalar function implemented in Hive code base, using the framework that Hive can understand.\nA scalar function implemented as a SQL-invoked external routine, with the routine name pointing to a file containing Java code in text. (SqlInvokedFunction).\nAll 3 of them are implemented in the Java programming language.\n\nI would say, even if we generalize the definition of language from SqlInvokedFunction to all SqlFunction in general, all 3 cases should have language Java. The suggestion that you made about assigning Language.Java to case 1, and Language.Hive to case 2 seems to me that you're looking to convey extra information with the \"language\" concept or the \"Language\" enum. The extra information is \"what framework that the Java implementation adheres to\" - does it use the Presto annotation (Can be parsed by Presto to create a SqlScalarFunction), or is it a Java class enclosing a Java method like the Hive-style.\nGoing back to what you say \"Language is a rightful metadata that every function should have.\" I agree if by saying \"language\", you actually mean the programming language in which the function is implemented, and in all of those 3 cases, \"Java\". I don't agree if the \"language\" you're talking about also conveys the extra information about the framework/assumption that the Java implementation uses, because\n\nThat should not be called \"language\".\nThat can be derived from the class object.\nThat's a special case for language Java because Presto and Hive happens to be implemented in Java, and therefore it should not be packed together with \"SQL\", \"Python\", \"JS\", etc., the one that actually only means programming language.\n\n\nPlease separate implementation from concept\n\nAlthough I gave code examples, I don't meant to discuss about implementation details at all. To validate whether a concept is valid, one of the ways would be have a thought experiment about whether there will be issues like conflicts or undefined/unclarified cases when the concept is introduced.\nLike I said above, if getLanguage returns the programming language. I don't see having that in SqlFunction would be a problem (but I don't think it's useful). However, if getLanguage returns differently for different types of Java implementation, then having getLanguage is not only not useful, but also require extra checks, which indicates a flawed OOP design.", "author": "caithagoras", "createdAt": "2020-05-01T21:49:51Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQxNjg5ODEyMQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQxODc2MTYzMQ==", "url": "https://github.com/prestodb/presto/pull/14392#discussion_r418761631", "bodyText": "@rongrong Sorry about the long post here.
