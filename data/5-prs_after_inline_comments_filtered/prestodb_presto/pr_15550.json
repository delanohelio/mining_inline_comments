Current we don't support FRC in those places, so there should not be DynamicFilterPlaceholderFunction in the first place.\nHandling DynamicFilterPlaceholderFunction in RowExpression is not easy as that means we would need a specific visitor to detect it. On the other hand, I think a better approach is that whenever we detect dynamic filters as we are creating drivers, we put empty FRC context in DriverContext.", "author": "shixuan-fan", "createdAt": "2021-01-27T00:32:49Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0NzAzMTYyMg=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0NzAzMzA4Mg==", "url": "https://github.com/prestodb/presto/pull/15550#discussion_r547033082", "bodyText": "Could you reminds me a bit on why we need partitioning scheme at the very first place?
