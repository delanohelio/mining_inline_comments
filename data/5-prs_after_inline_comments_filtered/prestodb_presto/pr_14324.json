I think that's less confusing and we should try make anything user facing start to use that terminology if we're going to be surfacing the \"total memory\" more. To me, Peak Memory and Peak Total Memory sound like they should mean exactly the same thing and it's confusing that they don't.  Peak user memory and peak total memory at least sound like they might mean different things.  Even if you don't know what user memory is, you'd probably infer that there's some other kind of memory that total memory includes.\nAlso, possibly controversial opinion (for a bigger discussion separate from this PR), but I don't really think separating user memory and system/total memory is that valuable.  I mean, it gives a quick way to see whether a query is using lots of memory from reading maps or if it's from building hash tables and sorting, but you could also learn that from the operator stats. From a cluster management perspective it's not relevant, and for a user just trying to understand the resource utilization of their query, I think it's more confusing than helpful.", "author": "rschlussel", "createdAt": "2020-04-03T21:09:50Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwMzIyNjMxNA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwMzM0MzkzOA==", "url": "https://github.com/prestodb/presto/pull/14324#discussion_r403343938", "bodyText": "I agree it's a distinction that doesn't seem useful most of the time.\nI'll change it.
