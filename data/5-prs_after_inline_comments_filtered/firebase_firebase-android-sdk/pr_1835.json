But all primitives are already available and value decoders could directly return the value like:\ninterface ValueDecoder<T> {\n  @Nullable T decode(ValueDecoderContext ctx);\n}\nwdyt?", "author": "vkryachko", "createdAt": "2020-07-30T18:11:27Z", "path": "encoders/firebase-decoders-json/src/main/java/com/google/firebase/decoders/ValueDecoder.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,23 @@\n+// Copyright 2020 Google LLC\n+//\n+// Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n+// you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n+// You may obtain a copy of the License at\n+//\n+//      http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n+//\n+// Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n+// distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n+// WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n+// See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n+// limitations under the License.\n+\n+package com.google.firebase.decoders;\n+\n+/**\n+ * This interface should be implemented by a specific ValueDecoder to provide its decoding logic.
