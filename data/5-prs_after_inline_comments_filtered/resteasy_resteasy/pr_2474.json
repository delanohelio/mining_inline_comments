That is, if there IS a servlet, just use the servlet and matching <servlet-mapping> and return. Maybe it's worth checking for the existence of a <servlet-mapping>. It sounds like the JAX-RS spec is saying there must be a <servlet-mapping>, so it would be an error if there is none. But maybe that should get caught by the servlet container.

Use @ApplicationPath path if the path is not specified in the web.xml.  If it is specified in the web.xml, then ignore the @ApplicationPath path.  So, first off, I think I need to remove my last commit.\nIt looks like it is possible for a servlet to be defined in the web.xml without a mapping ( see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12602805/can-we-invoke-a-servlet-without-servlet-mapping-in-web-xml-entry ).  The spec says that if an Application class is handled by a servlet, then no further configuration is necessary - unfortunately, it doesn't say one way or the other about whether the servlet must be mapped or not...\nSo, in the case where the servlet is mapped, I think we're fine.  None of my code is destructive if the user has specified things like the servlet class to handle it, etc. It does add RESTEASY init parameters (for scanned classes, etc.) - I don't think this should be a problem, but if we want to absolutely sure we could check that the servlet class name is a RESTEasy servlet before setting those parameters.\nIn the case where the application is handled by a servlet in the web.xml but does not have a mapping - I tend to think this is a bug - or best case using the jaws of life to remove a staple (using a JAX-RS application just to run something at app startup when a simple servlet would do).  The code as it is now (and as it will be after I remove the latest commit) would map the application to the @ApplicationPath path.  I think that this makes sense since we have no other path to use.  Another option would be to ignore the application and issue a warning to the user indicating that they should either delete the unmapped servlet from the web.xml or they should map it in the web.xml.  I'd be fine with either approach.\nSo:\n\nShould we check the servlet class name to be sure it is a RESTEasy servlet before adding RESTEasy init parameters?\nShould we ignore an application in the unmapped-servlet case and issue a warning?  Or default to the @ApplicationPath path?\n\nand whichever way we go on 1 and 2, I will plan to revert the commit that removes the early return.\nThanks again!", "author": "andymc12", "createdAt": "2020-09-14T19:33:59Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4NjY5NTQ2OQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4OTEwMTQxOQ==", "url": "https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy/pull/2474#discussion_r489101419", "bodyText": "re: \"I could just retire and leave this issue to somebody else\"\nLolll.

Holy Rashoman, Batman!!\nI'm going to try to write out all of the possibilities, for my own understanding.\nI. No Application\nWe MUST create a servlet, and there MUST be a <servlet-mapping> in the web.xml.  Technically, the Servlet spec would be ok without the <servlet-mapping>, but JAX-RS considers that an error.\nII. Application exists\nA. Matching servlet exists\nThe JAX-RS spec says, \"no additional configuration steps are required [my emphasis]\". However, the Servlet spec allows for the absence of a <servlet-mapping>, and JAX-RS doesn't FORBID using an @ApplicationPath path if it exists. In fact, it doesn't FORBID using \"/*\" if @ApplicationPath doesn't exist. So that's different from my previous understanding. Actually, I think assuming we can use \"/*\" as a default is probably a bad idea. It's probably better to consider it an error if there's no <servlet-mapping> and no @ApplicationPath.\nB. Matching servlet doesn't exist\nWe MUST create a servlet. If @ApplicationPath exists, we MUST use it. Otherwise, the web.xml MUST have a matching <servlet-mapping>. [I agree that this feels backwards, btw.]\nI think that's all consistent with your last comment, so that's good.\nAs for your questions:\n\n\nIf we find a servlet based on an Application name, then the servlet must be intended to be a JAX-RS servlet, right? So I think we're good, unless I'm missing something.\n\n\nI like the idea of using the @ApplicationPath. The developer probably meant it to be used.\n\n\nAnd finally, I think I've finally put my finger on something that's been bothering me semi-consciously. Suppose you have\n@ApplicationPath(\"/foo\")\npublic class MyApp extends Application { ... }\n\nIf web.xml is\n<web-app>\n  <servlet>\n    <servlet-name>MyApp</servlet-name>\n  </servlet>\n  <servlet-mapping>\n    <servlet-name>MyApp</servlet-name>\n    <url-pattern>/myresources/*</url-pattern>\n  </servlet-mapping>\n</web-app>\n\nThen there is a matching servlet, and /myresources overrides /foo. But suppose web.xml is\n<web-app>\n  <servlet-mapping>\n    <servlet-name>MyApp</servlet-name>\n    <url-pattern>/myresources/*</url-pattern>\n  </servlet-mapping>\n</web-app>\n\nThen, I guess, there isn't a matching servlet, and /foo overrides /myresources.\nIf I'm right, then\n\nthat's weird, and\nprobably <servlet-mapping> should override @ApplicationPath in both cases, for consistency.\n\nIf I'm right, maybe we should create an issue.", "author": "ronsigal", "createdAt": "2020-09-16T20:19:34Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4NjY5NTQ2OQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4OTc4NDQ0OA==", "url": "https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy/pull/2474#discussion_r489784448", "bodyText": "@ronsigal everything looks right there.\nI don't think my changes handle case 1 (No Application subclass), but I don't think the previous code handled it either (looks like it was commented out...).

If a user is allowed to specify a servlet-mapping without a servlet, then I agree that if the servlet-mapping/servlet-name matches the Application subclass, then it makes sense to map that app subclass to the associated url-pattern.

The behavior of the no Application subclass case is the same in this change as it was before this change.  If we want to address that case further, I'd suggest we open a new JIRA for it.\n\n\nI agree that having a  without a  seems strange, but otherwise I don't know how to make sense of\n\n\nIf no servlet  handles  this  application,  JAX-RS  implementations  are  REQUIRED  to  dynamically\nadd a servlet ... .  If the Application subclass is annotated with @ApplicationPath, ... .  Otherwise, the application\nMUST be packaged with a web.xml that specifies a servlet mapping.\n\nI think the spec clarifies it further using an example and table.  In the example of the web.xml it shows both a servlet and a servlet-mapping element.  The table says:\n\nThat says to me that the same web.xml content is required for an Application subclass without the @ApplicationPath as for the case where there is no Application subclass - and in that case too, the servlet and servlet-mapping are present in the web.xml.\nMy take on the text in question is that if there is no @ApplicationPath annotation, then the user MUST provide a web.xml that contains a servlet and servlet-mapping.  If there is an @ApplicationPath annotation, then the user does not need to provide a web.xml at all, but they can if they want to override the path specified in the application.\n\n\nGiven the title of the JIRA, \"Use servlet mapping from web.xml when not specified in @ApplicationPath\", I think these new things can go here. The only thing I would break out is the code that allows a class to be both an Application and a resource, since that's more of a new feature.\n\n\nThat works for me.  I'll split it out today and open a separate JIRA and PR for that feature.\nThanks again for all the review on this!", "author": "andymc12", "createdAt": "2020-09-24T14:07:14Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4NjY5NTQ2OQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "9fd833f0a7841b69c36200be7b6a0e021b5470e2", "url": "https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy/commit/9fd833f0a7841b69c36200be7b6a0e021b5470e2", "message": "RESTEASY-2650: Use web.xml servlets for app path\n\nAlso handle single class that is both an App and a resource class.\n\nSigned-off-by: Andy McCright <j.andrew.mccright@gmail.com>", "committedDate": "2020-09-10T15:16:59Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"oid": "7ac1fc518c31ae5f9127ccb4450714bf73be5093", "url": "https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy/commit/7ac1fc518c31ae5f9127ccb4450714bf73be5093", "message": "RESTEASY-2650: Use web.xml servlets for app path\n\nAlso handle single class that is both an App and a resource class.\n\nSigned-off-by: Andy McCright <j.andrew.mccright@gmail.com>", "committedDate": "2020-09-24T14:22:15Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "1bf0e2396d460932b47637a6dd673bf83b2fa8d6", "url": "https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy/commit/1bf0e2396d460932b47637a6dd673bf83b2fa8d6", "message": "Review comments - remove app-and-resource\n\nSigned-off-by: Andy McCright <j.andrew.mccright@gmail.com>", "committedDate": "2020-09-24T14:22:15Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "1bf0e2396d460932b47637a6dd673bf83b2fa8d6", "url": "https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy/commit/1bf0e2396d460932b47637a6dd673bf83b2fa8d6", "message": "Review comments - remove app-and-resource\n\nSigned-off-by: Andy McCright <j.andrew.mccright@gmail.com>", "committedDate": "2020-09-24T14:22:15Z", "type": "forcePushed"}]}
