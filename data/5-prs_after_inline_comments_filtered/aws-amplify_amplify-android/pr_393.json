If actor A is writing to this, and actor B is reading from it, how will actor B know when to read? Even though you have an isSet(), actor B might ask at the wrong time.\nTo that point, the construct is inherently racy, which is why Java makes the AtomicReference as a thread-safe utility in the concurrency package.\nOne of the reasons Rx is popular for async programming is that it provides a way to chain together asynchronous work that depends on other asynchronous work.\nI think the point of the AyncResult here is to decouple a chain of async work, from some synchronous work. But as above, this will destroy the dependency relationship, some event/trigger that notifies another component that the value state has changed.", "author": "jamesonwilliams", "createdAt": "2020-04-23T18:55:43Z", "path": "core/src/main/java/com/amplifyframework/util/AsyncResult.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,55 @@\n+/*\n+ * Copyright 2020 Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates.
