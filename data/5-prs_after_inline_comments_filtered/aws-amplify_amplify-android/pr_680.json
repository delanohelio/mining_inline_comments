The old signatures are still available. However, a caller may\noptionally tap into progress updates by using these newly available forms:\n\n```kotlin\nAmplify.Storage.downloadFile(fromRemoteKey, toLocalFile,\n    StorageDownloadFileOptions.defaultInstance(),\n    { Log.i(\"download\", \"Progress = ${it.fractionCompleted}\") },\n    { Log.i(\"download\", \"Result = ${it.file.canonicalPath}\") },\n    { Log.e(\"download\", \"Error = ${it.localizedMessage}\") }\n)\n```\n\nOr:\n```kotlin\nAmplify.Storage.uploadFile(toRemoteKey, fromLocalFile,\n    StorageUploadFileOptions.defaultInstance(),\n    { Log.i(\"upload\", \"Progress = ${it.fractionCompleted}\") },\n    { Log.i(\"upload\", \"Result = ${it.key}\") },\n    { Log.e(\"upload\", \"Error = ${it.localizedMessage}\") }\n)\n```\n\nWhile not part of the public API, the UPLOAD_PROGRESS and\nDOWNLOAD_PROGRESS Hub events are being removed. Previously they were\npublished without any token to signify which download or which upload\nto which they meant to refer. In a system with multiple uploads and\ndownloads, this would become a source of defects.\n\nResolves: https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-android/issues/679", "committedDate": "2020-07-30T03:47:14Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "be8d47beb76f7b68fa426c468e0d911c4439b744", "url": "https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-android/commit/be8d47beb76f7b68fa426c468e0d911c4439b744", "message": "feature: adds progress callbacks to storage\n\nThe Storage category in Amplify iOS includes progress listeners, which\ncan be used to monitor the status of an active download or upload.
