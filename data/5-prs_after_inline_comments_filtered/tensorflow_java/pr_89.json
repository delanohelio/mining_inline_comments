I don't think it should be in TfFunction though as it maps all signatures while an instance of TfFunction is only mapped to one of them.\n\nTfFunction should not have a reference to the session. Let SavedModelBundle manage the session (which it already does). TfFunction can become a pure data class.\n\nThat would prevent though to just invoke function.call(tensor) to run the graph, which I personally like. While I understand that data classes have their lot of advantages, I'm not sure there is real gains for having TfFunction as one of them, especially that Session instances are thread-safe.\n\nAdd SavedModelBundle.call(String signature, Map<String, Tensor> inputs, Map> outputs) to SavedModelBundle. TfFunction can become private and not exposed to end user as well.\n\nAgain, I personally like the OO approach of letting users manipulating callable entities instead of having SavedModelBundle acting as a \"service\". Is the intention here is just to hide the TfFunction at the user level? Note that I was planning to reuse the same object to add new signatures to a model when exporting it (but I could also do it just with SavedModelBundle if we decide to take that direction).", "author": "karllessard", "createdAt": "2020-07-31T15:38:15Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2MzE4MDgwNQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ3MDkxNjg3OA==", "url": "https://github.com/tensorflow/java/pull/89#discussion_r470916878", "bodyText": "Hi Karl and Shajan,\nI have been busy with traveling, and didn't have time to follow up on this thread.

SavedModel currently \u201cowns\u201d the session and is responsible for closing the resource to avoid memory leaks.  If we create TFFunction objects holding references to the session, it complicate the resource ownership mental model.  For example, we will need to do things such as the below:\n\nPerform reference counting on the session, and have the last \u201cuser\u201d of the session close it.  This is user friendly, but introduces complexity and room for bugs.  OR\nContinue to let SavedModel own the session, but TFFunction objects need to anticipate that it\u2019s underlying resource (the session) can become defunct at anytime.   This can be counterintuitive to users as users likely need to surround their call with a try/catch.\n\n\nIs the intention here is just to hide the TfFunction at the user level?\n\nMy intention was to not have to think about the resource ownership problem, and keep the resource ownership unchanged. The API of having TFFunctions be callable and exposed to users sounds great to me, and we need to think about the above 1 & 2 though.  This is not a contrived scenario: we already do model hot swapping at Twitter in our prediction servers, and SavedModels are hot swapped without restarting the JVM.\nThank you Karl and Shajan!", "author": "yzhuang", "createdAt": "2020-08-16T00:06:41Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2MzE4MDgwNQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}]}
