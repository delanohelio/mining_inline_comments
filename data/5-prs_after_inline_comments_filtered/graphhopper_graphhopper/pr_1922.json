So at this point its clear that the profile exists (unless there is some programming error and my assumption that it was checked before is false). So we could either skip this check here entirely, or repeat the check again, or use an assert as a bit of a reminder that (if nothing is broken) we can be sure the profile exists. In general of course you are right and the program logic should not depend on an assert. Here it does not because the same check is done before already.

Why should I continue in production when we are in a wrong situation? It feels worse than catching an exception and then just logging it :)\n\nThe idea is that this code never goes to production, because some tests will fail. I think assertions can:\n\n\nhelp finding the source of an error (you know something goes wrong at some place, but assertions might tell you that the real reason something went wrong was that something else went wrong before this)\n\n\nhelp communicate under which assumptions some code was written\n\n\nYou are right because both things can be achieved equally well by throwing IllegalStateException (or some shorter helper method that does this) as long as performance is not an issue. My idea here was that the assert tells me that we are checking something that has already been checked anyway, but I see this is not easy to follow for others.\nIf however assertions are used more extensively (and possibly using some assertions that are more expensive than a simple boolean check) they can certainly be useful because they can be disabled for production. The present case is not a good example for that, but generally I think using more asserts is a good thing to do (especially in code where calculating some precondition only to find out whether or not we are in a sane state is expensive). For example RoutingKit does this a lot and its almost like you do not need tests anymore (or only a few), because when running the code with enabled assertions there is a very high chance some assertions fail when you are making a programming error and it improves readability when you are told what the expectations for the current method call were when the method was written. You are also able to easily test internal things that would never be easy to cover using tests. Ok, this is a whole other use-case than what we are talking about here, but I would just not go as far as saying that asserts are always bad or distracting.\n-> I'll remove the assert :)", "author": "easbar", "createdAt": "2020-02-23T20:58:56Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4MjkyODE0NQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4MjkyODI3Mg==", "url": "https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/pull/1922#discussion_r382928272", "bodyText": "In both exceptions I would link to this issue #1922 to give more context.", "author": "karussell", "createdAt": "2020-02-22T17:31:38Z", "path": "core/src/main/java/com/graphhopper/routing/ch/CHPreparationHandler.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -60,36 +60,21 @@ public CHPreparationHandler() {\n \n     public void init(GraphHopperConfig ghConfig) {\n         // throw explicit error for deprecated configs\n-        if (!ghConfig.get(\"prepare.threads\", \"\").isEmpty())\n+        if (ghConfig.has(\"prepare.threads\"))\n             throw new IllegalStateException(\"Use \" + CH.PREPARE + \"threads instead of prepare.threads\");\n-        if (!ghConfig.get(\"prepare.chWeighting\", \"\").isEmpty() || !ghConfig.get(\"prepare.chWeightings\", \"\").isEmpty())\n-            throw new IllegalStateException(\"Use \" + CH.PREPARE + \"weightings and a comma separated list instead of prepare.chWeighting or prepare.chWeightings\");\n+        if (ghConfig.has(\"prepare.chWeighting\") || ghConfig.has(\"prepare.chWeightings\") || ghConfig.has(\"prepare.ch.weightings\"))\n+            throw new IllegalStateException(\"Use profiles_ch instead of prepare.chWeighting, prepare.chWeightings or prepare.ch.weightings\");\n+        if (ghConfig.has(\"prepare.ch.edge_based\"))\n+            throw new IllegalStateException(\"Use profiles_ch instead of prepare.ch.edge_based\");", "originalCommit": "d7ad54a3f9fea16f6c645a4f7dd7e146163c8cb0", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4MzAyMjg5MQ==", "url": "https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/pull/1922#discussion_r383022891", "bodyText": "Good idea, done", "author": "easbar", "createdAt": "2020-02-23T17:25:54Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4MjkyODI3Mg=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4MjkyODMyNA==", "url": "https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/pull/1922#discussion_r382928324", "bodyText": "(I also would put here a link to this issue in the error message)", "author": "karussell", "createdAt": "2020-02-22T17:32:38Z", "path": "core/src/main/java/com/graphhopper/routing/lm/LMPreparationHandler.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -70,7 +71,14 @@ public LMPreparationHandler() {\n     }\n \n     public void init(GraphHopperConfig ghConfig) {\n+        // throw explicit error for deprecated configs\n+        if (ghConfig.has(\"prepare.lm.weightings\")) {\n+            throw new IllegalStateException(\"Use profiles_lm instead of prepare.lm.weightings\");", "originalCommit": "d7ad54a3f9fea16f6c645a4f7dd7e146163c8cb0", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4Mjk5NTY2OA==", "url": "https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/pull/1922#discussion_r382995668", "bodyText": "Should we better make this method package protected to only allow jackson access to it?", "author": "karussell", "createdAt": "2020-02-23T11:31:39Z", "path": "api/src/main/java/com/graphhopper/config/CHProfileConfig.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,63 @@\n+/*\n+ *  Licensed to GraphHopper GmbH under one or more contributor\n+ *  license agreements.

I was wondering why are we creating an instance of the weighting here? Wouldn't it be enough to check if a weighting with a certain name is \"registered\"/\"available\"? Or is this the easiest option to check if the weighting is available?", "author": "boldtrn", "createdAt": "2020-04-28T15:09:03Z", "path": "core/src/main/java/com/graphhopper/GraphHopper.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -772,6 +822,45 @@ public boolean load(String graphHopperFolder) {\n         }\n     }\n \n+    private void checkProfilesConsistency() {\n+        for (ProfileConfig profile : profilesByName.values()) {\n+            if (!encodingManager.hasEncoder(profile.getVehicle())) {\n+                throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Unknown vehicle '\" + profile.getVehicle() + \"' in profile: \" + profile + \".
