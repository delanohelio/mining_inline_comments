What purpose would this have?\n\nTo me there just seem to be two 'stories' here and it makes the code easier to understand, test and change when we keep them separated. One story is about interpreting our custom model language and extracting a mapping between edges and speeds/priorities. This is already quite a complex task which involves janino and giving a meaning to the keys and values we define in the custom model. The other story is about taking the edge->speed/priority mapping and calculating edge weights from this (applying the formula we use in CustomWeighting). To me this seems to be independent from creating this mapping and for example we should be able to use CustomWeighting with some mapping that does not use yaml, janino and our custom model language at all. This also becomes clear when we think about testing : Right now its hard to test the first story in isolation (and I guess this is why we do not have such tests yet). We cannot really test the custom model language, janino and all this without creating a CustomWeighting. We also cannot create a CustomWeighting without using ExpressionBuilder or CustomWeightingHelper which are both related to janino. At the same time this coupling seems easily avoidable, because the edge->speed/priority mapping provides a very small boundary between the CustomWeighting and the custom model language interpreting code.\nHave a look at this test in CustomWeightingTest:\n       EdgeIteratorState primary = graph.edge(0, 1).setDistance(10).\n                set(roadClassEnc, PRIMARY).set(avSpeedEnc, 80).set(accessEnc, true, true);\n        EdgeIteratorState secondary = graph.edge(1, 2).setDistance(10).\n                set(roadClassEnc, SECONDARY).set(avSpeedEnc, 70).set(accessEnc, true, true);\n\n        CustomModel vehicleModel = new CustomModel();\n        vehicleModel.getPriority().put(\"road_class != PRIMARY\", 0.5);\n\n        assertEquals(1.15, createWeighting(vehicleModel).calcEdgeWeight(primary, false), 0.01);\n        assertEquals(1.73, createWeighting(vehicleModel).calcEdgeWeight(secondary, false), 0.01);\nHere we create some edges and a custom model and what we really want to do is testing if our custom model rules yield the right speed/priority. But we cannot test this directly so we create a CustomWeighting and have to check the outcome of our custom model indirectly (we have to know the formula in CustomWeighting). So we need to compare the weight we get to some magic numbers like 1.15 and 1.73.\nI will try to refactor this a bit so you can see what I mean exactly.", "author": "easbar", "createdAt": "2020-12-13T10:54:27Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0MTE0NDUzMA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0MTkxNzQ1Mw==", "url": "https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/pull/2209#discussion_r541917453", "bodyText": "See this draft: #2211", "author": "easbar", "createdAt": "2020-12-13T12:39:51Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0MTE0NDUzMA=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0MTE0NTM3Mg==", "url": "https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/pull/2209#discussion_r541145372", "bodyText": "Why 'maximum' distance_influence?

That is what I meant with 'default' namespace: It is allowed to put statements without nesting and choosing a label. But if we ever wanted to 'import' or exclude such statements in the future we could define that importing 'default' means we import everything from the top level.\nWhy do you think it would be better if super classes had to explicitly 'export' something?\nAnother thing we should consider is that currently speed and priority are lists in yaml, but what if we add the labels or need to add some special keys like:\nspeed:\n   # do we need this someday?\n   parent: ../some/other/car.yml\n   - if: ... # as before\n   # here comes a labeled group of if statements\n   avoidSmallRoads:\n       - if: #...\nDo you think we can keep speed/priority as list, but simply parse the single entries as different types, i.e.:\nspeed:\n   - parent: #...\n   - if: #...\n   - avoidSmallRoads: #...\nAh ok, but with the export/run syntax maybe this is already solved. This seems like a good idea: using a separate export section and already use it in the super model. Then using it in a sub model is just the same except it references another file.
