I basically wanted to keep the existing behavior for individual exercises the same and model the behavior for team exercises after it as far as there are parallels.\nThe behavior for individual exercises is that instructors could respond to a complaint but not to a more feedback request. That makes sense in so far as complaints in individual exercises can be handled by any secondary person who is at least a tutor while more feedback requests can only be handled by the originally assessor (since only they know why they assessed something a certain way).\nIn team exercises, both types of student feedback are only handled by the team tutor himself so in that regard they both behave more like \"more feedback\" requests for individual exercises. Thus I think it makes sense if only the original assessor can respond to complaints for team exercises. It would be surprising for the students if suddenly a different person responds when they expect it to be their tutor for team exercises.", "author": "madwau", "createdAt": "2020-06-01T09:23:23Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzMjg4MDE2Mg=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzMzE1MDk0Mw==", "url": "https://github.com/ls1intum/Artemis/pull/1527#discussion_r433150943", "bodyText": "My idea was that instructors could possibly solve a complaint in case a tutor is unable to do so, either because of lack of knowledge or e.g. personal issues that prevent the tutor from evaluating the complaint/feedback request.\nI agree that it does not make sense to add this right now, as there is also no way to display these requests.
