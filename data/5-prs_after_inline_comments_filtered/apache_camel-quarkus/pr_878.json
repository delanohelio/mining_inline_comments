As far as I could check, the Quarkus Qute extension produces those for all files under templates. So we should perhaps make it a requirement for the users to store their templates under templates. WDYT?\nIt should be documented in docs/modules/ROOT/pages/extensions/qute.adoc if we go that way. In any case, we should add a link to the Qute guide there https://quarkus.io/guides/qute\nNow, how could we set the \"real\" Qute engine to our Qute component: I think we could try to do something like the OpenTracing extension is doing https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/blob/master/extensions/opentracing/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/quarkus/component/opentracing/CamelOpenTracingRecorder.java#L32", "author": "ppalaga", "createdAt": "2020-03-16T08:53:27Z", "path": "extensions/qute/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/quarkus/component/qute/CamelQuteRecorder.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,37 @@\n+/*\n+ * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more\n+ * contributor license agreements.
