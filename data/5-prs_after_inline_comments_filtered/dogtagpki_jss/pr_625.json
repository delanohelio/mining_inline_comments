This\ncauses problems with NSS, because they assume the hostname is available\nfor validation at handshake time.\n\nIn order to support this use case, when the hostname is `null` on a\nclient SSL socket, we will attach using SSL_BadCertHook and give the\nJSSEngine a chance to bypass this value.\n\nSigned-off-by: Alexander Scheel <ascheel@redhat.com>", "committedDate": "2020-08-31T18:39:48Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "f7811272bdfb29a0ef78d77e3a55d9ff11132eb3", "url": "https://github.com/dogtagpki/jss/commit/f7811272bdfb29a0ef78d77e3a55d9ff11132eb3", "message": "Add SSLErrors with SSL_ERROR_BAD_CERT_DOMAIN\n\nThis is the only SSLError we wish to allow through in regular JSSEngine\nclient operations.\n\nSigned-off-by: Alexander Scheel <ascheel@redhat.com>", "committedDate": "2020-08-31T18:48:02Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "c40aa4ed21899d789fcbf4d2179caad4c92aa67c", "url": "https://github.com/dogtagpki/jss/commit/c40aa4ed21899d789fcbf4d2179caad4c92aa67c", "message": "Bypass SSL_ERRORS_BAD_CERT_DOMAIN for JDK\n\nWhen JSSEngine is used via the provider interface, most callers won't be\naware that they're using JSSEngine.
