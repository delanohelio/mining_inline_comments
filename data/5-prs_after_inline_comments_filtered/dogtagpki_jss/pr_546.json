TLSv1.1 made it optional and Pornin seems to think its a non-issue.\nIn TLSv1.3 the new spec says on page 86:\n\nEach party MUST send a \"close_notify\" alert before closing its write\nside of the connection, unless it has already sent some error alert.\nThis does not have any effect on its read side of the connection.\nNote that this is a change from versions of TLS prior to TLS 1.3 in\nwhich implementations were required to react to a \"close_notify\" by\ndiscarding pending writes and sending an immediate \"close_notify\"\nalert of their own.  That previous requirement could cause truncation\nin the read side.  Both parties need not wait to receive a\n\"close_notify\" alert before closing their read side of the\nconnection, though doing so would introduce the possibility of\ntruncation.\n\nWhich seems to imply that we're safe to close the inbound side earlier, and that lack of a CLOSE_NOTIFY should be treated as fatal.
