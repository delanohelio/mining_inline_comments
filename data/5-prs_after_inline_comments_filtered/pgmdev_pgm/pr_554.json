It would be expected that if you just add a map to the vote it would \"force\" one map and keep the other 4 random. Instead, what vote managing commands do, is expect you to select 2-5 options for the user to pick from. Some form of a \"setnext between this options\".\nI think vote commands should always replace options of whatever vote will be held next, and maybe optionally make it so it makes the vote only the maps added via command, but i heavily doubt that will ever be used (wich is what we currently have)", "author": "Pablete1234", "createdAt": "2020-07-07T15:42:56Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ1MDcwNTMwMw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ1MTAxNjgyOA==", "url": "https://github.com/PGMDev/PGM/pull/554#discussion_r451016828", "bodyText": "I converted this PR to a draft and will work on adjusting the logic to handle vote management as you suggested @Pablete1234 \ud83d\udc4d", "author": "applenick", "createdAt": "2020-07-07T17:09:01Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ1MDcwNTMwMw=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ1MTEwMzM4OQ==", "url": "https://github.com/PGMDev/PGM/pull/554#discussion_r451103389", "bodyText": "Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n                for (int i = 0; i < voteSize; i++) {\n          \n          \n            \n                for (int i = overrides.size(); i < voteSize; i++) {", "author": "Pablete1234", "createdAt": "2020-07-07T19:48:03Z", "path": "core/src/main/java/tc/oc/pgm/rotation/MapPoll.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -68,6 +70,9 @@ private void selectMaps() {\n     NavigableMap<Double, MapInfo> cumulativeScores = new TreeMap<>();\n     double maxWeight = cummulativeMap(0, sortedDist, cumulativeScores);\n \n+    // Add all override maps before selecting random\n+    overrides.forEach(map -> votes.put(map, new HashSet<>()));\n+\n     for (int i = 0; i < voteSize; i++) {", "originalCommit": "53f2dec997d804f408883e6f04d71f0bb909f5ca", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ1MTExNTM4NQ==", "url": "https://github.com/PGMDev/PGM/pull/554#discussion_r451115385", "bodyText": "Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n                                      Sets.newHashSet(),\n          \n          \n            \n                                      Collections.emptySet(),", "author": "Pablete1234", "createdAt": "2020-07-07T20:11:32Z", "path": "core/src/main/java/tc/oc/pgm/rotation/VotingPool.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -98,12 +101,13 @@ public void matchEnded(Match match) {\n               // If there is a restart queued, don't start a vote\n               if (RestartManager.isQueued()) return;\n               currentPoll =\n-                  shouldCustomVote()\n+                  shouldOverride()\n                       ? new MapPoll(\n                           match,\n                           getCustomVoteMapWeighted(),\n+                          Sets.newHashSet(),", "originalCommit": "53f2dec997d804f408883e6f04d71f0bb909f5ca", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "c2751c640ec51071d2e1821f4720d3d7d444f2a8", "url": "https://github.com/PGMDev/PGM/commit/c2751c640ec51071d2e1821f4720d3d7d444f2a8", "message": "Switch override to create\n\nSigned-off-by: applenick <applenick@users.noreply.github.com>", "committedDate": "2020-07-11T18:39:10Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"oid": "26f3c05bfb0f71a71793a4450cc731a3ee0dd476", "url": "https://github.com/PGMDev/PGM/commit/26f3c05bfb0f71a71793a4450cc731a3ee0dd476", "message": "Rework /vote logic\n* Added create & replace vote modes\n\nSigned-off-by: applenick <applenick@users.noreply.github.com>", "committedDate": "2020-07-11T18:44:55Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "26f3c05bfb0f71a71793a4450cc731a3ee0dd476", "url": "https://github.com/PGMDev/PGM/commit/26f3c05bfb0f71a71793a4450cc731a3ee0dd476", "message": "Rework /vote logic\n* Added create & replace vote modes\n\nSigned-off-by: applenick <applenick@users.noreply.github.com>", "committedDate": "2020-07-11T18:44:55Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"oid": "07b9ce2ceb2b04c1b7fd9a9bead00ea210de3c80", "url": "https://github.com/PGMDev/PGM/commit/07b9ce2ceb2b04c1b7fd9a9bead00ea210de3c80", "message": "Fix duplicate translation key\n\nSigned-off-by: applenick <applenick@users.noreply.github.com>", "committedDate": "2020-07-11T19:20:55Z", "type": "commit"}]}
