This bug/PR still assumes that offlineResourceBaseURL is configured in the main VIPCfg only, and is globally shared across main and \"sub\" Instances. In other words, the issue above is not related to this.\nThe bug also exists only when executing the main app outside of the executable jar (like in an IDE). This is because if the single configured offlineResourceBaseURL folder exists in both main and shared lib, it loads the first offlineResourceBaseURL folder that it finds, which is in the main app's file system. It ignores the jar filers. That is how ClassLoader.getResource works.  However. if the main app is packaged as a jar, it combines its own files and shared lib jars' files into a single file system. Hence, the offlineResourceBaseURL folder will contain components from main app and shared libs, if present.\nIn the sample-app-with-shared-lib, the offlineResourceBaseURL folder inside the subinstance (shared lib) jar is not read when my IDE's JVM picks only the offlineResourceBaseURL in the main app. The expected behavior is that it will also load the bundles inside the offlineResourceBaseURL folder in the shared library jars, just like when the main app is packaged as an executable jar. In other words, if the the shared library jar carries the translations inside it, the translation should be loaded by the root application as well.", "author": "jessiejuachon", "createdAt": "2020-11-12T16:41:58Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyMjE2NjAzOA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyMjQ5NDYxOQ==", "url": "https://github.com/vmware/singleton/pull/869#discussion_r522494619", "bodyText": "On a side note that is not related to the scope of this PR, we will resolve your concern about being able to configure separate VIPCfg properties per product/shared lib in issue:#755.

It could happen that there are multiple nested jar shared libraries (hence, many URIs for the offline resource bundle location) for the SAME product-version, but different component-locales set in each shared library. This happens in production like in Atlas. For example, the main app only has component1 in the offline location, but has a nested shared library jar that has component2 in the same offline location inside the jar (again, same product version). Without this PR, it will only see component1. It will miss component2 entirely, so all messages in component2 will not be localized.\nThe issue of having some wrong locale-component combination already exists even before this PR. See sample-app-with-shared-lib as an evidence. The application is not packaged as a nested jar (a fat jar instead), and the offline bundle location path is same in the main app (sample-app-with-shared-lib) and in the shared library (sample-shared-lib). Even if product-versions are different (JavaSample 1.0.0 vs. SharedProduct 1.0.0), all of the component folders of both products end up in the same offline bundle location folder in the fat  jar.. causing the incorrect combinations that you are referring to. This is an existing bug tracked in 870. This PR did not cause the issue. It has been there already.\nAgain, let's resolve the issue of getting supported locales and components by product-version (or propose any other solution)  in #870.
