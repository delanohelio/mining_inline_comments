Part of the problem is that some errors are benign and others are likely an indication of a catastrophe.  Maybe configuration is the best option, could have three configuration items.\n\nConfigurable list of errors to retry on.\nConfigurable list of errors to halt on.\nAction to take for errors that fall in neither list : hang, retry, halt.\n\nThis would allow when a new error is encountered like in #1644 that the error class could just be added to config for retry.\n\nIt could be that all of these changes go away and I simply catch the NoClassDefFoundError and call it a day.\n\nMaybe a follow on issue would be best.  I feel like this is a wider issue, because any thread could encounter an error and having a single mechanism for handling unexpected errors in server processes seems useful.\nI am also wondering if emitting metrics for errors would be useful.  If the cardinality is deemed low enough, could emit metrics for each error class name.  Then in the metrics system could see when a tserver has an out of memory error.
