First the {@value #THRESHOLD_OPT} option allows setting the point\n+ * at which a compaction will be triggered. This options defaults to {@value #THRESHOLD_OPT_DEFAULT}\n+ * and must be in the range (0.0, 1.0]. The second option is {@value #PROCEED_ZERO_NO_SUMMARY_OPT}\n+ * which determines if the strategy should proceed when a bulk imported file has no summary\n+ * information.\n+ *\n+ * <p>\n+ * If the delete summarizer was configured on a table that already had files, then those files will\n+ * have not summary information. This strategy can still proceed in this situation. It will fall\n+ * back to using Accumulo's estimated entries per file in this case. For the files without summary\n+ * information the estimated number of deletes will be zero. This fall back method will\n+ * underestimate deletes which will not lead to false positives, except for the case of bulk\n+ * imported files. Accumulo estimates that bulk imported files have zero entires.
