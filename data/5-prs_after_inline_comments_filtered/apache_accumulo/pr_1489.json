Working the issue along those lines, there are two sections in ZooSession where calculations are performed using millis values for all the operands:\n      if (System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime > 2L * timeout) {\n        throw new RuntimeException(\"Failed to connect to zookeeper (\" + host\n            + \") within 2x zookeeper timeout period \" + timeout);\n      }\n      if (tryAgain) {\n        if (startTime + 2L * timeout < System.currentTimeMillis() + sleepTime + connectTimeWait)\n          sleepTime = startTime + 2L * timeout - System.currentTimeMillis() - connectTimeWait;\n        if (sleepTime < 0) {\n          connectTimeWait -= sleepTime;\n          sleepTime = 0;\n        }\n        UtilWaitThread.sleep(sleepTime);\n        if (sleepTime < 10000)\n          sleepTime = sleepTime + (long) (sleepTime * secureRandom.nextDouble());\n      }\nOne solution is to convert from millis to nano when the values are first assigned. There are a couple issues I see with doing that. One, timeout is still being passed into the method in millis and would need to be converted at the point-of-use (or assigned a value within the method, which breaks convention). Two, there are calculations that use these values, but do not use startTime, that are already working correctly. Also, TIME_BETWEEN_CONNECT_CHECKS_MS would likely need to be refactored to ...-NS.\nAnother solution (pasted below) is to  do conversions on the operands. This will prevent the Numeric Overflow Errors, but kind of decreases the readability of the code. Scaling up the operand values might not make them more accurate, but we should not lose accuracy this way.\n      if (TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS.toMillis(System.nanoTime() - startTime) > 2L * timeout) {\n        throw new RuntimeException(\"Failed to connect to zookeeper (\" + host\n            + \") within 2x zookeeper timeout period \" + timeout);\n      }\n    if (tryAgain) {\n        if (TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS.toMillis(startTime + 2L * TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.toNanos(timeout))\n            < TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS\n                .toMillis(System.nanoTime() + TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.toNanos(sleepTime)\n                    + TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.toNanos(connectTimeWait))) {\n          sleepTime =\n              TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS.toMillis(startTime + 2L * TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.toNanos(timeout)\n                  - System.nanoTime() - TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.toNanos(connectTimeWait));\n        }", "author": "cradal", "createdAt": "2020-01-31T13:45:09Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3MzAyNjQ0NA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3MzQ5MzQ4MA==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/1489#discussion_r373493480", "bodyText": "@cradal I updated your comment's Markdown to use syntax highlighting, to make it easier to read, but I think it'd be easier if you just updated the PR with the new changes you are proposing, rather than paste it in to a comment.
