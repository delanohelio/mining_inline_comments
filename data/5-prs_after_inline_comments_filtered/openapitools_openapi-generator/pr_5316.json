Using 'title' can lead to completely unexpected outcomes for the generated code.\nThe OAS spec clearly states the 'title' attribute is for human consumption, so codegen should not use it.\nI was working with a draft OAS document that has a composed allOf schema. The \"title\" of the inner schema happens to be the name of the outer (composed) object, but it could also have been any value, including names of totally unrelated schema.\nThat had the weird side effect to nullify the inheritance hierarchy.
