We have hundreds of background tasks executed once per second, because we use a WeakMap implementation with a \"background\" cleanup policy. These background tasks continue until the application shuts down, but the injectedClassLoaders map may never actually be used, and even if it is, its usefulness is short-lived and concentrated at the start of the application's life.
