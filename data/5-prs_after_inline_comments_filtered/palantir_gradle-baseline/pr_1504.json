That only affects an edge case where the get style has been customized and the field with that part removed is an identifier (eg getPublic), so maybe it's not a big deal (I solved it here by hard coding the style to get* and is*and bailing if there are fields that can't be initialized after transforming like that). There are other ways that the style could in theory be changed (eg changing the name of the from method) that I don't think we would be able to handle.\nInstead, if it were upstreamed then I'd prefer to go with an annotations-based approach, as mentioned above.", "author": "jackwickham", "createdAt": "2020-10-09T16:44:08Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwMjU0Nzg5Mg=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "e0412d3a05b8d5bb9af55382cad7ab5704d5b69f", "url": "https://github.com/palantir/gradle-baseline/commit/e0412d3a05b8d5bb9af55382cad7ab5704d5b69f", "message": "Update javadoc", "committedDate": "2020-10-09T16:48:40Z", "type": "commit"}]}
