Without this, all tests are passing except for the forward-compatibility test that validates Spark can read tables with unknown transforms. When we see an unknown transform, we don't know what type of results it produces so we can't create a hash function or comparator ahead of time like we try to do here.\nThe actual problem is that when we create a hash function, it expects a CharSequence becuase our assumed result type is the most generic: string. That causes hashing to fail with a ClassCastException. The work-around, which is ugly, is to use the partition field doc to signal when this happens so that the hash function can use Objects::hash that can hash any object using its hashCode method, instead of trying to use our CharSequence hash function.", "author": "rdblue", "createdAt": "2020-08-10T21:43:02Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2ODA1MDY4Nw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2ODIxMjkzMA==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1307#discussion_r468212930", "bodyText": "I had an idea to fix this by making the hash function for strings check the value class.
