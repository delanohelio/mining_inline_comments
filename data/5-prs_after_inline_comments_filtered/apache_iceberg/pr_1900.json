If we're writing with the OutputStream::write interface, that would only be writing a single byte, so 100 bytes in this case.  That wouldn't be enough to trigger the multipart behavior.\nI think that's the case for most of the tests I see here.  You might want to look at the S3Outputstream test because you can actually validate the operations performed like this: https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/master/aws/src/test/java/org/apache/iceberg/aws/s3/S3OutputStreamTest.java#L109", "author": "danielcweeks", "createdAt": "2020-12-10T23:04:40Z", "path": "aws/src/integration/java/org/apache/iceberg/aws/s3/S3MultipartUploadTest.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,192 @@\n+/*\n+ * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\n+ * or more contributor license agreements.
