These methods adjust for that.\n\nI think the main problem is that this uses a path where the value is modified by ORC based on the JVM environment, which breaks a fundamental rule in Iceberg. I don't think that we should use a path where the value is modified. It's just too hard to guarantee that although the value was modified, we were able to correctly undo it.\n\nI agree, ORC in this respect violates the rule and modifies the stored value. I'm okay with not using this path, and therefore removing Date metrics collection if that's okay.
