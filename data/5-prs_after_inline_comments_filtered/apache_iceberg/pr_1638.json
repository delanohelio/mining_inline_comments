For binary columns\ngenerated by CDH 1.5.0 to 1.7.0, the function returns hasNonNull as false\neven if there are nonNull values in the column. This not an issue for files\nwritten by OSS Parquet because of a seperate bug which prohibts reading these\nstatistics from Parquet earlier than 1.8.0. The fix for that bug (PARQUET-251)\nwas backported in to the CDH distribution so it correctly can return statistics\nbut not in a format that Iceberg is able to handle correctly.", "committedDate": "2020-10-20T23:34:26Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwOTczOTgxNg==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1638#discussion_r509739816", "bodyText": "Should we also test -1 for num nulls?
