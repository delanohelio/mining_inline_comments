The most important part to retry is locating the files that need to be deleted. Not reading a manifest list could lead to hundreds of orphaned files.\nI think the original rationale for not retrying when deleting a file was that we expect more failures there from files that have already been deleted. If a file is missing, then we shouldn't try to delete it 4 times... but other than in our environment where we use bucket policy in some places I'm not sure where that might happen. Also, the deletes for metadata files that have probably been read should be retried.\nSo I think it's reasonable to add a retry for the delete methods, too.", "author": "rdblue", "createdAt": "2020-04-16T17:12:30Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwOTE4Nzc4NQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwOTc0OTc1NQ==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/928#discussion_r409749755", "bodyText": "Added with a guard on deletes for NotFoundException.", "author": "prodeezy", "createdAt": "2020-04-16T18:04:22Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwOTE4Nzc4NQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwOTE4ODA4Nw==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/928#discussion_r409188087", "bodyText": "This indentation seems a bit awkward to me because the arguments are indented so much less than the LOG.warn call.
