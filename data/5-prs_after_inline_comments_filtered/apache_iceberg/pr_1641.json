I'll leave this as Stream.empty for now.\nRegarding relying on recent Parquet versions to not produce min or max values that are NaN, sounds like that also answers my question in the pr description (i.e. we won't follow this approach to populate upper and lower bounds). In my current code base it looks like parquet still gives us NaN as max; do you happen to have a reference to the parquet version that supports NaN properly?

I'll look into it more deeply if you don't have it handy.\n\nso it should be safe to use these as long as we check that they are not NaN.\n\nSorry to make sure I understand this correctly, sounds like only the three following cases will be valid:\n\nv1 table, no NaN counter, min/max could have NaN - use the existing logic, we can't do much about min/max==NaN\nv2 table, NaN counter exists, min/max will not be NaN - in this case metrics are produced by iceberg writer\nv2 table, no NaN counter, min/max will not be NaN - in this case the file is imported or from this fileMetrics\n\nThen to accommodate for (3) we will have to remember in evaluators that absence of NaN counter doesn't necessarily mean there's no NaN value in the column; but that might be fine since we will need this logic to accommodate (1) as well (unless we implement evaluators in a way that we can differentiate v1/2 table; not sure if we want that).", "author": "yyanyy", "createdAt": "2020-11-02T22:06:21Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwOTg0Mjg4Mg=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxNzY0NzE0Mw==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1641#discussion_r517647143", "bodyText": "I don't have a reference for the Parquet fix. I think I was in a sync where it was discussed. Maybe we should generate our own lower/upper bounds for Parquet then.\nFloat.compare will sort NaN values last, so if we do get max=NaN from Parquet our evaluators should still work as expected. It will just include a much larger range than necessary. If we can generate better stats for table metadata, then that would be ideal.\nYour cases look correct, except that I would say that we expect only max=NaN or min=max=NaN from Parquet.

Currently this class is only being used for reading rows for metadata tables (in RowDataReader, and I think only the metadata table will produce DataTask).\nIn the tests I wanted to convert Record to InternalRow for testing Spark appender. I was debating if I should expand this class beyond its current usage, or to write a new converter. Here are the two things I need to change to (partially) implement the former:\n\nnull handling which results to the change in get(): RowDataReader doesn't call get() directly (it uses Dyn reflections for reading individual attributes and skip nulls) for converting into other Spark internal row representation (UnsafeRow in this case), thus we didn't see issue. However, when spark parquet writer uses get(), without this change NPE will occur. Note that even after this change, other use cases of this class (e.g. getUTF8String() are still not null safe, and I wonder if people have opinion on if we want a full null-safe support update to all methods in this class.\nfor getBinary() change, currently we convert Fixed type to binary for Spark (link), and the method I used for creating random records generate fixed type with byte[] (link), and before this change getBinary() doesn't work for byte[] implementation of fixed type. Alternatively we could wrap fixed type in random record generator the same way we do for binary type.

The NPE eventually comes from struct.get(index, types[index]) in SparkParquetWriters. While the actual InternalRow could return null for null column, for StructInternalRow it assumes the underlying get() returns non-null, and sometimes performs some actions to them that could lead to NPE. e.g. call toString for converting, or return as primitive type directly.
