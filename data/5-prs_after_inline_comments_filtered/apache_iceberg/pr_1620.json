It sounds like we should change these for HiveRunner tests, where we have less control of the connections. If Hive itself doesn't pool or close connections, then we would need to bump this up.\nCould you make this configurable so that we can set it for the tests that need it?", "author": "rdblue", "createdAt": "2020-10-16T16:55:03Z", "path": "hive-metastore/src/test/java/org/apache/iceberg/hive/TestHiveMetastore.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -166,8 +166,8 @@ private TServer newThriftServer(TServerSocket socket, HiveConf conf) throws Exce\n         .processor(new TSetIpAddressProcessor<>(handler))\n         .transportFactory(new TTransportFactory())\n         .protocolFactory(new TBinaryProtocol.Factory())\n-        .minWorkerThreads(3)\n-        .maxWorkerThreads(5);\n+        .minWorkerThreads(5)\n+        .maxWorkerThreads(15);", "originalCommit": "877e145ecd4d06a34afd0c073ffb9a2cc767b2ef", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwNzUyOTIwOA==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/1620#discussion_r507529208", "bodyText": "Created the new PR: #1629", "author": "pvary", "createdAt": "2020-10-19T07:29:56Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwNjYwMTY4MQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}]}
