I was encountering the issue when running a single document through multiple steps. After you pointing out that the flow runner only uses one thread, I wonder if simply setting the thread pool size to 2 would be enough. I think what was happening was that afterExecute would add the next step to the threadPool, but the current step execution was occupying the space.", "author": "ryanjdew", "createdAt": "2020-01-16T21:32:16Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM2NzYzMzkzMw=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "960b12d389b9e2c61686afce08c573b8720b6d9e", "url": "https://github.com/marklogic/marklogic-data-hub/commit/960b12d389b9e2c61686afce08c573b8720b6d9e", "message": "DHFPROD-3156: Increase performance of flow run", "committedDate": "2020-01-16T21:38:55Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "960b12d389b9e2c61686afce08c573b8720b6d9e", "url": "https://github.com/marklogic/marklogic-data-hub/commit/960b12d389b9e2c61686afce08c573b8720b6d9e", "message": "DHFPROD-3156: Increase performance of flow run", "committedDate": "2020-01-16T21:38:55Z", "type": "forcePushed"}]}
