So flow-developer was still being used to load artifacts and modules.\nFlowRunWithDataHubOperatorTest then calls getHubFlowRunnerConfig after calling setupProjectForRunningTestFlow, which ensures the flow is run as that user.\nIf your goal is to ensure that data-hub-developer can load artifacts and modules, I don't think this is the right test for that (and that wasn't happening either).
