through the notification extension service and be known as the `ExtNotificationWillShowInForegroundHandler`\n    * This involves a new metadata tag in apps using OneSignal,\n    * On init of OneSignal, searches for an extension service file and save the implementations as global handlers to be used throughout OneSignal codebase\n  * Second one will be implemented through a public OneSignal setter called `setNotificationWillShowInForegroundHandler` and is known as the `AppNotificationWillShowInForegroundHandler`\n    * From these handlers a set of new functionality exists now:\n      * This includes bubbling from ext to app handler to mimic iOS handler before showing notification\n      * Also without bubbling a 30 second timeout will begin counting down before showing notification by default\n  * Renamed `NotificationGenerationJob` to `OSNotificationGenerationJob`\n  * To help keep things private within the handlers, a `NotificationGenerationJob` class was made to be extended by a `ExtNotificationGenerationJob` and `AppNotificationGenerationJob`\n* Removed what is believed to be final Alert based flow for showing a notification\n\n* Unit Tests need to be fixed and new ones added still after validating functionality here\n* Next the Work manager should be implemented to process these one at a time as they come in", "committedDate": "2020-07-01T17:20:16Z",
