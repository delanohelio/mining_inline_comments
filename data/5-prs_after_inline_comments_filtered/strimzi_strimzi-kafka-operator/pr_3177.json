I think an input for it having a predictable and repeatable set of topics would be useful but perhaps default it to seed using the current unixepoch?

Again it seems super unlikely that this will ever happen- but making a random topic name that obeys Kafka topic name regex is probably not too hard.", "author": "samuel-hawker", "createdAt": "2020-06-12T19:15:51Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzOTQ4ODI1Mg=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzOTk3NjU5NA==", "url": "https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/pull/3177#discussion_r439976594", "bodyText": "Yes, sounds reasonable.
