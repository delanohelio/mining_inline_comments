Can it occur because the broker is slow or connection with broker is slow? If so the thing will fail due to something else - not due to TopicAuthorizationException. In that case the test will pass even though it didn't properly execute. You have to actually get to the underlying reason for failure, WaitException may not be enough to properly test the expected behaviour here.\nBut most of all, as far as I can see this test rather than test if reauthentication is activated, assumes that it is activated and properly working, and then tests some expected behavior on top of that assumption. It does not test reauthentication. It tests refreshing of grants under the assumption that reauthentication is active and working as assumed. There may be a bug in how Kafka CR is turned into Kafka Broker /tmp/strimzi.properties and even though you activate reauthentication in Kafka CR it may not actually be enabled in Kafka Broker. This test might (depending on the access token timeout) pass even if reauthentication isn't actually activated.\nIt might even pass (to my understanding, as described above) if the test cluster is simply slow and unresponsive.\nI said that testing this was tricky, so it should be worked out in a document before attempting to write a complicated test.
