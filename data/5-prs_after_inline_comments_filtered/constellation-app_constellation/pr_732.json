My thoughts based on this is that you never want it to grab a group by an iterator that is larger than the total number of groups. This happens when you cluster it once, then add elements to the graph. When you switch off interactive mode it iterates all nodes which were effected in the last cluster so it can revert the changes. Just writing this now it seems like there may be a possibility that it iterates the vertices, but does so under the assumption that the first x elements are the same as the ones which were clustered. I did not notice any issues with testing under normal circumstances.\nMaking it the minimum of both makes it avoid checking the groups that does not exist, but still effectively returns the state to normal in the vertices that were effected under \"interactive mode\"\nDoes this sound logical, or do you suggest revisiting it.
