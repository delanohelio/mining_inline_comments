For the IP 192.168.1.1 there are 3 possible types and using the AnalyticDominanceCalculator the one with highest priority is HOST_NAME so that's why it's getting picked. Below is the output of the possible types when I run the unit test:\nJun 17, 2020 4:34:22 PM au.gov.asd.tac.constellation.graph.schema.type.SchemaVertexTypeUtilities matchVertexTypes\nWARNING: Multiple types matched identifier 192.168.1.1: [Network Identifier.IP Address.IPv4 Address, Online Location.Host Name]\n\nNote that if I run the 'Extract Types from Text\" plugin and put in 192.168.1.1 I get \"IPv4 Address\" for the type which is inconsistent to Hostname here. The issue there looks like different methods are used. Split nodes uses SchemaVertexTypeUtilities.matchVertexTypes() and the applies the VertexDominantCalculator whereas \"Extract Types from Text\" plugin uses SchemaVertexTypeUtilities.extractVertexTypes().\nI would suggest this is a bug and should be resolved asap but outside the scope of how Split Nodes plugin works", "author": "arcturus2", "createdAt": "2020-06-17T06:50:34Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzNzA1NDk0NQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0MzI0ODk2NQ==", "url": "https://github.com/constellation-app/constellation/pull/568#discussion_r443248965", "bodyText": "@cygnus-x-1 I created #596 to continue this discussion.
