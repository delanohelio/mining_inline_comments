Essentially control-flow-by-exception-handling anti-pattern. Signalling error cases directly via response objects and letting the controller layer or service/module layer decide how to handle is generally more direct (after-all, an exception is a glorified go-to, for better or worse).\nThe game-id not being there is quite a problem. We would suspect it's a client error, hence 4xx is reasonable. We would not want users to be able to craft a curl command to generate server side 5xx's on demand.\ncanDoReverseConnect  not throwing is kinda useful as we allow its caller to decide if the situation is an error or not. It's the caller that has more context about whether the game-id is valid to begin with. It's a bit odd though as we ask the same module twice \"is this valid\", then \"try this\". It would probably be a bit more appropriate to have a service back the controller, have the server use a 'canDoReverseConnect' function and pass the function the game listing to use.
