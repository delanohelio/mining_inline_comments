This meant the unit scroller was not pre-filled\n  with a territory or units. An empty unit scroller is only really expected\n  when all units have moved. The problem was introduced in another fix to avoid\n  unnecessary computation when the unit scroller is not visible anyways. There\n  are a number of other fixes that make that not as much of a problem. For now\n  it is necessary to do computation in the unit scroller when it is not visible\n  so that when it does become visible, the data in the unit scroller would be\n  current.", "committedDate": "2020-03-31T07:48:53Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwMDcxMjY2OQ==", "url": "https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/pull/6117#discussion_r400712669", "bodyText": "Identical blocks of code found in 2 locations.
