Could that be a silent bug? Why would a caller want to invoke a method for a no-op, it seems that the caller did not realize it was dealing with an infinite roll value.\nI think this leads to some bigger questions. Perhaps RollValue is not just a simple integer and should not be exposed as that. We have a getValue() method as well that returns a magic number to indicate if the roll value is infinite (which is a SRP violation, the number is then context dependent and either it means the roll value, or if it is a magic number then it tell us the roll value is infinite).\nI think this is probably solved by handling the infinite case at the point of the caller.

It is taking the map support rules as designed by the map designer and adding it to the roll.
