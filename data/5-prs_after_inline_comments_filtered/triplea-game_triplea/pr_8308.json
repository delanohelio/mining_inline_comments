Looking at the one method in this class, I notice the API is not the prettiest. Of note, we have two int parameters side by side that could be swapped or would be hard to distinguish.\nOne fix would be to convert the parameters of the method to private variables and then use a builder to construct and have a no-arg 'rollDice' method. That should clean up the usage. Though, a lot of the parameters are simply to feed the call to \"bridge.getRandom(sides, rollCount, playerRolling, diceType, annotation);\". I think this method might be trying to do too much an dperhaps should take a random[] as a parameter and then it would have far fewer methods.

I think the latter, but maybe it's even both??\nSo please have some thoughts about the naming for rollNDice and consider spelling it out to make it easier on a reader.\nRe: Factory methods\nOkay, it's good to know this is supposed to be a factory method. I think the cohesion heuristic is potentially low as we have a factory class, with a factory method, that are in one package, meanwhile DiceRoll is in: package games.strategy.triplea.delegate;\nMy concern about the 3 factory classes is that they are each relatively shallow, it's not offhand clear they are factories either explicitly or from the javadocs, and it's potentially not clear when to use and not the other.\nTo alleviate these concerns I can suggest we combine the factory methods into one class and then document when you would use one each one. Seeing the series of methods in one class file I think would draw context between when each one would be used. I think ideally the factory class would be 'close' by to the 'DiceRoll' class, though I can understand not having them co-located just yet.\nWDYT?", "author": "DanVanAtta", "createdAt": "2020-11-29T20:13:26Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUzMjEyNTE2OQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUzMjMxODA3OQ==", "url": "https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/pull/8308#discussion_r532318079", "bodyText": "@DanVanAtta , I've renamed RollNDice to RollNSidedDiceXTimes.
