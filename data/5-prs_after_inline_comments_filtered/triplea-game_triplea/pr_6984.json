Having that be different is slightly helpful.\nwe still go from 'n' reports being linear to the number of versions instead of number of occurrances.\nwe avoid a situation where we think we fixed the problem in 'v4', but perhaps we did not. If we de-dupe on title only, then a closed issue is theoretically definitive even if the problem is re-introduced or never fixed in the first place.\n\nIn part we're being clever about detecting when problems are fixed by just de-duping by title and version. If we suppressed all future version reports we'd need to know when a problem is fixed. As-is, a person looks at the bug report, sees it's closed and hopefully we'll comment which version has a fix.\nGoing forward pre-release hopefully will get back to being used for preview and testing and not early access like it was. In part the early access was due to map features and because map versioning is deficient when it comes to forward & backward compatibility.
