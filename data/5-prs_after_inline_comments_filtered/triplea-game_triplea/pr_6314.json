Are you going off of Stack Overflow, are there other examples in the code, or is this a pattern you just know?\nCan you simulate an exception going through this and give an example? Perhaps better yet, a test to do that would be excellent. It could be readily done by elavating this methodto a strategy object and then testing it. (EG:  this method becomes a class that implements Function, then testing the new class you can do a string contains assertion to verify that key words from a nested exception are all present/printed)", "author": "DanVanAtta", "createdAt": "2020-04-23T00:07:29Z", "path": "game-core/src/main/java/org/triplea/debug/error/reporting/StackTraceErrorReportFormatter.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -91,18 +92,15 @@ private String buildBody(@Nullable final String userDescription, final LogRecord\n   }\n \n   private static String throwableToString(final Throwable e) {\n+    final var outputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\n+    try (PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(outputStream, false, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)) {", "originalCommit": "9d303fd6795506d737482f0faf49dfb33a0fd1a8", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQxMzYwOTI2NA==", "url": "https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/pull/6314#discussion_r413609264", "bodyText": "It's just a pattern I know.
