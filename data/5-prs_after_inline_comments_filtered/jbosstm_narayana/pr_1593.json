The Java API is cursor based - you seek to the location you want to write, then write it. So you'd get lock contention on the shared cursor. The fd.sync is also a problem - it syncs the whole file. The O/S will be dirty tracking at the block level, but will still incur some overhead to find the dirty blocks to flush. So, you'd certain get less resource (RAM) usage, but I don't see a performance improvement as likely. It's more the other way around I think.\nHowever...\nThe pmem backend is designed to use memory mapping over a single file. It's also JDK14 only, because that's the first version that has the pmem support in the JVM. So it can and does use the newer Java API that allows both absolute position writes (no cursor to lock, you specify the offset as a call parameter instead) and region flush - calling the new force(offset, length) instead of force().  Although it's designed for pmem, it should be possible to run almost the same code in non-pmem mode, at which point it's equivalent to the single file version of the store you suggest. So another reason the DiskSlots one is multi-file, is to provide an alternative for comparison.  Finally, the multi-file approach is more robust to slotSize changes, as it can grow files. With a single file, you have to delete and recreate the whole thing if you want to change the slotSize.", "author": "jhalliday", "createdAt": "2020-04-15T09:14:54Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwODI1MzY2Mw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwODc0MzA1Nw==", "url": "https://github.com/jbosstm/narayana/pull/1593#discussion_r408743057", "bodyText": "Good explanation.", "author": "mmusgrov", "createdAt": "2020-04-15T10:33:20Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwODI1MzY2Mw=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwODI1NTgyOA==", "url": "https://github.com/jbosstm/narayana/pull/1593#discussion_r408255828", "bodyText": "Would assert data.length <= SlotStoreEnvironmentBean#bytesPerSlot provide any debug benefit.\nBTW this implementation uses a file per slot and since a files' size is unlimited the bytesPerSlot config should not apply to this particular BackingSlots implementation (in particular in SlotStore#write there is a check that the data size < config.bytesPerSlot).", "author": "mmusgrov", "createdAt": "2020-04-14T16:05:02Z", "path": "ArjunaCore/arjuna/classes/com/arjuna/ats/internal/arjuna/objectstore/slot/DiskSlots.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,115 @@\n+/*\n+ * JBoss, Home of Professional Open Source\n+ * Copyright 2020, Red Hat, Inc. and/or its affiliates,\n+ * and individual contributors as indicated by the @author tags.\n+ * See the copyright.txt in the distribution for a\n+ * full listing of individual contributors.\n+ * This copyrighted material is made available to anyone wishing to use,\n+ * modify, copy, or redistribute it subject to the terms and conditions\n+ * of the GNU Lesser General Public License, v. 2.1.\n+ * This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT A\n+ * WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A\n+ * PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Where a write that's supposed to be a single atomic change gets split up and is not atomic, it's said to be torn, as in tearing a piece of paper and holding onto only part of it.\nInternally the O/S is holding pages (1k or 4k, depending) in the buffer cache and writing disk blocks (used to be 512bytes, now 4kbytes) to the underlying device driver to send back to the media. Note that neither the O/S nor the media strictly guarantees to handle a single block write atomically, but in practice it's assumed to. Writes that span multiple blocks can theoretically fail such that one block is persisted and the other isn't, but again most systems rely on this not happening. Since tx records usually fit in one block it's not much of an additional concern for us anyhow. In the old days we had to try to squeeze the tx record into 512 bytes, but that's ancient history...\nFor pmem, which doesn't go via the O/S block layer, writes are at cache line granularity i.e. 64bytes rather than 4096bytes. That's a lot more efficient for small records. But it's also a lot harder to program against, because it comes with a twist... Whereas the O/S will flush a dirty block to the backing store only when you tell it to (lazily with close, or immediately with fd.sync), the CPU can evict a cache line back to the persistent memory whenever it likes. You can tell it to when you want, like calling sync, but... you can't stop it doing it at other times. Thus you get torn writes frequently, both because you've got smaller 'blocks', but also because you get unpredictably timed persistence operations. Hence persistence design for pmem storage is more conservative and makes use of checksums or other techniques that can be more or less safely skipped for regular storage if you trust the O/S.", "author": "jhalliday", "createdAt": "2020-04-15T11:09:43Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwODI2NjgzOA=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwODI2ODM4MQ==", "url": "https://github.com/jbosstm/narayana/pull/1593#discussion_r408268381", "bodyText": "or the checksum of the contents of slot failed", "author": "mmusgrov", "createdAt": "2020-04-14T16:23:08Z", "path": "ArjunaCore/arjuna/classes/com/arjuna/ats/internal/arjuna/objectstore/slot/BackingSlots.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,66 @@\n+/*\n+ * JBoss, Home of Professional Open Source\n+ * Copyright 2020, Red Hat, Inc. and/or its affiliates,\n+ * and individual contributors as indicated by the @author tags.\n+ * See the copyright.txt in the distribution for a\n+ * full listing of individual contributors.\n+ * This copyrighted material is made available to anyone wishing to use,\n+ * modify, copy, or redistribute it subject to the terms and conditions\n+ * of the GNU Lesser General Public License, v. 2.1.\n+ * This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT A\n+ * WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A\n+ * PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
