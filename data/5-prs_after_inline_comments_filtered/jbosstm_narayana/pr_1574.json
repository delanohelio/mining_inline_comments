Perhaps we need to understand better why the remove is failing.

How do you propose to suppress subsequent warnings? I am not aware of a precedent to do that in Narayana so far.\n\nMy suggested code first removed the participant from the volatile map and then called recoveryStore.remove_committed\nif (committedParticipants.remove(participantId) != null) {\n      // the key was in the map and it has now been removed\n      try {\n         recoveryStore.remove_committed\n         etc\nStandard recovery ought to pick up the record if it was indeed a transient (and if the failure is because the record isn't there then we don't need to keep retrying the remove).\nThere is no precedent since normal recovery is handled by periodic recovery where we do need to keep WARNing the user.\nAs Ondra points out, XTS does the same as what's in the PR. On that basis I could be overruled on this one.\n\nDoesn't the recovery manager report repeated failures to recover things? But if there are other examples of that let's evaluate as repeating the message at WARN at least might not be so useful (perhaps trace) and might be covered by wording the message that the failure will not be re-reported?\n\nThis is not periodic recovery. This is the REST-AT bridge cleaning up after it has finished processing a transaction.\nI would agree the second part of your statement (TRACE + a message that it will not continue reporting the WARNing).\n\nBTW, given the current state of the patch (in that we only put it in the map when write_committed passes or it is recovered/recreated, I can't guess why remove_committed would throw an exception now but maybe there is something in the recover/recreated paths that would do that?\n\nI agree that such a failure is unexpected and most likely would be because something/somebody has already deleted the record, in which case the repeated WARNing is not good. If the cause is a transient storage failure (for example the JDBC store could not be contacted) then perhaps a subsequent attempt at removal might succeed but what is the tradeoff of not deleting the log versus filling the log with duplicate WARNings. Not deleting the log should have no effect (question does this RecoveryManager have any interaction with the InboundBridgeRecoveryModule) until the JVM is restarted (when the local cache of committedParticipants is recreated from what's in the store).\nSo filling up log with repeated information that does not add any further value should be avoided.", "author": "mmusgrov", "createdAt": "2020-04-01T15:37:17Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5OTM2MzU3Nw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwMTcyMjAyMQ==", "url": "https://github.com/jbosstm/narayana/pull/1574#discussion_r401722021", "bodyText": "I am adding my approval of this PR on the following basis:\n\nXTS does the same as what's in this PR.\nThe error should may only ever occur each time an InboundBridgeManager is created (after a server restart) and after a transaction is finished.\nAs far as I can see this new code is not ran by Periodic Recovery so my concern about filling the logs on each recovery pass is not a valid concern.\n\nBut I'd still argue that my points made in the previous comment are still valid but not sufficient to block this PR.", "author": "mmusgrov", "createdAt": "2020-04-01T15:51:45Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5OTM2MzU3Nw=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5OTM3MjAwNw==", "url": "https://github.com/jbosstm/narayana/pull/1574#discussion_r399372007", "bodyText": "What does <Participant Id :: Uid> mean.
