I think GEODE-7956 was just about correcting the docs. It looks to me like you are expanding what a legal region name is to include square brackets. Did this get approved in a RFC?

In we end up keeping square brackets in region names then update GEODE-7956 to say we should and why it is valuable.", "author": "dschneider-pivotal", "createdAt": "2020-05-29T21:17:34Z", "path": "geode-core/src/main/java/org/apache/geode/internal/cache/RegionNameValidation.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -24,7 +24,7 @@\n \n public class RegionNameValidation {\n \n-  private static final Pattern NAME_PATTERN = Pattern.compile(\"[aA-zZ0-9-_.]+\");\n+  private static final Pattern NAME_PATTERN = Pattern.compile(\"[a-zA-Z\\\\[\\\\]0-9-_.]+\");", "originalCommit": "a21f6ba7da6f18e86794c1baa0e1cab459e9c53f", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzMjc0MTU1Mw==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5159#discussion_r432741553", "bodyText": "I see your comment now about the old regex allowing extra characters.

I bet whoever wrote this thought that. But since the product was already released with a pattern that allows those other characters it would be safest to continue to allow those characters. To make a breaking change I think we need an RFC. For now it is best to change the docs to describe the behavior of the existing geode release. We could schedule removing these special characters from region names in a future release. I think it would be good to rewrite the regex to still match what it did before but to do it more explicitly (something like a-zA-Z0-9-_.^`[]\\) or add comments to make clear what A-z matches. I also think it would be good to have some explicit test methods that show that these special characters are allowed in region names.\nThanks for figuring this out!", "author": "dschneider-pivotal", "createdAt": "2020-06-01T07:31:38Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzMjczOTc4Nw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzMzA5MDI1Mg==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5159#discussion_r433090252", "bodyText": "Yes, I agree.
