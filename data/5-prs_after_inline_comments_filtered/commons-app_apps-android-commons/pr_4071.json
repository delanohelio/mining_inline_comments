So After each commit I am working on the updated code right? So if I did something wrong in the past commit and I didn't remove the extra variables, libraries, code etc.( that i pushed along with earlier commit) in the corrected commit, so while merging do maintainers get the option to select the commits they want to accept? But as I was working on the updated codebase so every time I make a commit old code(extra variables, libraries, code etc.) is also getting pushed along with new? so how to deal with that?\nIn my last branch I was deleting those earlier commits so that I could push the corrected code but somehow while moving the HEAD~ I used the wrong command.
