I don't think that reading the issue there is much consensus on what is to be done. Personally I'd be more for deleting fast scroll, to me flinging is very quick at getting through data and I don't understand why people want to be scrolling through explore>uploaded via mobile arbitrarily? Are people using it as a Random feature essentially? Is it a most recent list and if so why do they want to see the 1000th most recent item? I just don't understand who the feature is for so I can't make a recommendation on what to actually do.\n@maskaravivek has been leading the charge on this ticket so I would seek his review", "author": "macgills", "createdAt": "2020-04-07T08:46:05Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwMzk0MTY0MA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwNDY0MzMyNQ==", "url": "https://github.com/commons-app/apps-android-commons/pull/3593#discussion_r404643325", "bodyText": "I tend to agree with @macgills's comments and am not sure if fast scrolling truly adds any value or not.
