So, wouldn't it be better to name this hideAllMarkers?\nSince we're there. I also think the All part of the name is misleading as it gives the person reading the code the incorrect idea that we would be hiding all the marker while we're only hiding the markers which aren't close to current location. I think hideOtherLocationMarkers conveys that in a better way.", "author": "sivaraam", "createdAt": "2020-02-13T05:36:19Z", "path": "app/src/main/java/fr/free/nrw/commons/nearby/fragments/NearbyParentFragment.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -1186,9 +1187,11 @@ public void updateMarker(boolean isBookmarked, Place place, @Nullable fr.free.nr\n     }\n \n     /**\n-     * Greys out all markers except current location marker\n+     * Removes all markers except current location marker, an icon has been used\n+     * but it is transparent more than grey(as the name of the icon might suggest)\n+     * since grey icon may lead the users to believe that it is disabled or prohibited contribution\n      */\n-    private void greyOutAllMarkers() {\n+    private void removeAllMarkers() {", "originalCommit": "339b4948c53930ba55b1cb03e4a3c3f664495371", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3ODY2NzAwOQ==", "url": "https://github.com/commons-app/apps-android-commons/pull/3407#discussion_r378667009", "bodyText": "@sivaraam that's a nice suggestion I'll change this", "author": "kbhardwaj123", "createdAt": "2020-02-13T06:08:25Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3ODY1OTI5NQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "88183d7a9b044c45907f399f33c120e849dfe18d", "url": "https://github.com/commons-app/apps-android-commons/commit/88183d7a9b044c45907f399f33c120e849dfe18d", "message": "change method name to hideAllMarkers", "committedDate": "2020-02-13T06:51:02Z", "type": "commit"}]}
