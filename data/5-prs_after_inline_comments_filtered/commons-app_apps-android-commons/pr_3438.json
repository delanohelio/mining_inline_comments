Previously, when I mentioned Nearby works fine with \"GPS only\" I meant it works for me in all cases. So, it works for me even if it's the first time. Of course, it takes time depending on where you are. It's quick when you're outdoors. It takes time when you're inside a building as it's hard to find the satellites when you're indoors. As I said before, Nearby only wants the location to be enabled. Nothing more than that. If you observe otherwise, then it's an issue we should look into. Try going outdoors and observe if your device is located by Nearby when the location is in \"GPS only\". Let me know how this goes.\nComing to the reason about why we don't want to show the dialog whenever the network provider is disabled. Some privacy conscious people would prefer always to use \"GPS only\" mode for the Location as there's some controversy about privacy issues associated with what we call the network provider. It's a valid claim. If we show the dialog when the location is in \"GPS only\" mode and the network provider is disabled, then there's a chance those people might misinterpret this.
