API keys \"impersonate\" existing users, although they might have narrower privileges. In this case, the realm as set by the Set Security User Ingest Processor  is the \"realm\" of the creator user, which is the user the API key is impersonating. Also, we don't have a good way of expressing that the API key has the exact or less permissions of the creator user.\n\nBut I wonder whether it would be feasible and more consistent to implement both token and API key auth as true realms?\n\nI don't think so. Tokens, especially, are 100% designed to impersonate users and authenticating with a token or the user's credentials should be looking identical. An argument can be made that API keys are not part of a user realm, but API keys inherit the permissions of the creator so the \"realm\" of an API key can be defined as the realm of the creating user.\nI think this conv might benefit from high bandwidth conv over Zoom.

Thanks for pointing this out. The current user object is mostly align to ECS, except we have user.username instead of user.name. Also we have an extra user.metadata field which can be considered as custom fields.\nThe new api key info will also be custom fields. We are conforming to the schema by using lower case, underscore concatenated keys and non-abbreviation. And the contents cannot be mapped to any existing core or extended fields.
