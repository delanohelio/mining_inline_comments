However, it is not unusual for users to misconfigure\nnodes to pick a publish address which is inaccessible to other nodes. We see\nthis happen a lot if the nodes are on different networks separated by a proxy,\nor if the nodes are running in Docker with the wrong kind of network config.\n\nIn this case we offer no useful feedback to the user unless they enable\nTRACE-level logs. It's particularly tricky to diagnose because if we test\nconnectivity between the nodes (using their discovery addresses) then all will\nappear well.\n\nThis commit adds a WARN-level log if this kind of misconfiguration is detected:\nthe probe connection has succeeded (to indicate that we are really talking to a\nhealthy Elasticsearch node) but the followup connection attempt fails.\n\nIt also tidies up some loose ends in `HandshakingTransportAddressConnector`,\nremoving some TODOs that need not be completed, and registering its\naccidentally-unregistered timeout settings.", "committedDate": "2020-01-22T12:22:29Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "b10b474fced35881d31057204aa062aeb22a3acb", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/b10b474fced35881d31057204aa062aeb22a3acb", "message": "Meh let's always log the stack trace", "committedDate": "2020-01-22T13:15:32Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "1bd1c8ede0a6cc1936c4613fca968b88b728982e", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/1bd1c8ede0a6cc1936c4613fca968b88b728982e", "message": "Fix level and message", "committedDate": "2020-01-22T13:16:13Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "e787138641585b3e090d89ef49de78cd7e0d0165", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/e787138641585b3e090d89ef49de78cd7e0d0165", "message": "\ud83d\ude16", "committedDate": "2020-01-22T13:33:58Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM2OTYzNjYwNA==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/51304#discussion_r369636604", "bodyText": "Why move to wrap here?
