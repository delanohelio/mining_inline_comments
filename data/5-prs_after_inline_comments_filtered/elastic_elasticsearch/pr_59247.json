But here is the problem I ran into. When a node receives the TransportShardBulkAction transport message we mark the bytes. And as we discussed we would mark the bytes as primary in the updated version. However, we use the rerouteWasLocal marker to know whether we need to mark the bytes at the primaryAction level. In this new version we would need to mark the bytes if the rerouteWasLocal but on the TransportBulkAction node. But not on the node that receives the TransportShardBulkAction message. And I am not sure how to delineate there.\nWe could mark coordinating bytes when TransportShardBulkAction is received. And then mark bytes at the primary level. We can mark a delta when the rerouteWasLocal is true. And use that delta to avoid double accounted rejections. That just means that a primary node will always mark both coordinating and primary bytes. Technically the reroute component can be coordinating work. But it feels kind of weird.\nLet's discuss tomorrow and see if we still want to pursue this breakdown.", "author": "tbrooks8", "createdAt": "2020-07-13T04:04:32Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ1MjE1OTU2MQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "55ebd43fbed01924dcd3895c9bdb1de85051a995", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/55ebd43fbed01924dcd3895c9bdb1de85051a995", "message": "Changes", "committedDate": "2020-07-09T16:36:14Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "5e5d4562a2076c538582655906b88a337d15cc26", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/5e5d4562a2076c538582655906b88a337d15cc26", "message": "Merge remote-tracking branch 'upstream/master' into add_write_stats", "committedDate": "2020-07-09T16:54:43Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "2b7d49ab4613059af8bf405516ca69e5f6892a60", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/2b7d49ab4613059af8bf405516ca69e5f6892a60", "message": "Merge remote-tracking branch 'upstream/master' into add_write_stats", "committedDate": "2020-07-13T03:10:58Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "38ebbaecacf330fdba05cc673ea0f4df729425c9", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/38ebbaecacf330fdba05cc673ea0f4df729425c9", "message": "Changes", "committedDate": "2020-07-13T15:39:42Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "8ff21d8df654c839a70df4799c67a480a6cf6235", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/8ff21d8df654c839a70df4799c67a480a6cf6235", "message": "Merge remote-tracking branch 'upstream/master' into add_write_stats", "committedDate": "2020-07-13T15:53:22Z", "type": "commit"}]}
