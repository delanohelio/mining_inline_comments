It supports `NONE`, `ONE`, and `MANY` values and is generally\n   extensible if we decide we can use more precise counts.\n2. It is more accurate. `collectsFromSingleBucket` assumed that all\n   sub-aggregations live under multi-bucket aggregations. This is\n   normally true but `parentCardinality` is properly carried forward\n   for single bucket aggregations like `filter` and for multi-bucket\n   aggregations configured in single-bucket for like `range` with a\n   single range.\n\nWhile I was touching every aggregation I renamed `doCreateInternal` to\n`createMapped` because that seemed like a much better name and it was\nright there, next to the change I was already making.\n\nRelates to #56487", "committedDate": "2020-05-11T17:27:39Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyMzM2MDUwMw==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/56533#discussion_r423360503", "bodyText": "A better name for this might be CardinalityEstimate or CardinalityUpperBound.", "author": "nik9000", "createdAt": "2020-05-11T22:40:09Z", "path": "server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/search/aggregations/TotalBucketCardinality.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,84 @@\n+/*\n+ * Licensed to Elasticsearch under one or more contributor\n+ * license agreements.

This is the thing I was calling bucketCardinality in the PR. Confusingly, it is only a thing in BucketsAggregations.\n\nAlso confusingly, there are a couple of relationships between these things:\n\nAn Aggregator can calculate its bucket's cardinality - sometimes exactly like range and sometimes not like terms.\nAn Aggregator's bucket's cardinality is the cardinality of is sub-aggregations.\n\nThis PR, as it stands now, mixes those two things up and gives them funny names. I'd like to rework it.\nTo be clear: this is useful because knowing an Aggregator's cardinality with some precision would let us pick smarter aggregation implementations. This PR only gives three levels of precision: NONE, ONE, and MANY. But we can do better in a follow up when we're sure how we're going to use it.
