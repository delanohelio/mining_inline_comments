The major issue that we have in 7.x and did not\nhave in master is that we can't use the diagnostic trust manager\nin FIPS mode in Java 8 with SunJSSE in FIPS approved mode as it\nexplicitly disallows the wrapping of X509TrustManager.\n\nPrevious attempts like #56427 and #52211 focused on disabling the\nsetting in all of our tests when creating a Settings object or\non setting fips_mode.enabled accordingly (which implicitly disables\nthe diagnostic trust manager). The attempts weren't future proof\nthough as nothing would forbid someone to add new tests without\nsetting the necessary setting and forcing this would be very\ninconvenient for any other case ( see\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/56427#issue-415264309\nfor the full argumentation).\n\nThis change introduces a system property that effectively bypasses\nthe configuration value of xpack.security.ssl.diagnose.trust and\ndisables the diagnostic trust manager. We will then set this\nsystem property in our periodic CI jobs for Java 8.", "committedDate": "2020-05-11T16:06:05Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyMzI1MzkwMw==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/56526#discussion_r423253903", "bodyText": "Why can't we pass in fips mode as disabled in our tests properties from BuildPlugin?
