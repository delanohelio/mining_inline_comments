This\nmeans that the data stream isn't copied 1 to 1 into the local cluster. The local\ncluster's data stream definition contains the same name, timestamp field and\ngeneration, but the list of backing indices may be different (depending on when\na data stream was auto followed).\n\nCloses #56259", "committedDate": "2020-09-04T13:54:22Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "ca215b1bd2106b981e8827d78fef35d0757b9b74", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/ca215b1bd2106b981e8827d78fef35d0757b9b74", "message": "Merge remote-tracking branch 'es/master' into ccr_data_stream_support", "committedDate": "2020-09-07T14:06:01Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "206fbf05782519f7da1f3735e30e0d967575680c", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/206fbf05782519f7da1f3735e30e0d967575680c", "message": "move the check that checks parent data stream after the check whether index actually exists", "committedDate": "2020-09-07T14:11:42Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "addf40f637e1c4ba0e14239501e0ec92d9d77335", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/addf40f637e1c4ba0e14239501e0ec92d9d77335", "message": "delete auto follow pattern after test", "committedDate": "2020-09-07T15:26:26Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "40236726f06b7a4f76016d11b909c0b5c3a8ac20", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/40236726f06b7a4f76016d11b909c0b5c3a8ac20", "message": "Merge remote-tracking branch 'es/master' into ccr_data_stream_support", "committedDate": "2020-09-21T08:23:04Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "606da3dd85f1f8b0ffe99070d8b9ed290113eba3", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/606da3dd85f1f8b0ffe99070d8b9ed290113eba3", "message": "added tests and docs", "committedDate": "2020-09-21T12:05:08Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "551adc88f55afd843389a7de5cbb47b5999020a0", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/551adc88f55afd843389a7de5cbb47b5999020a0", "message": "updated jdocs", "committedDate": "2020-09-21T12:18:19Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "f81cc8b0e4a5586507aeca096c4b1e1a7cced1d7", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/f81cc8b0e4a5586507aeca096c4b1e1a7cced1d7", "message": "iter", "committedDate": "2020-09-21T13:10:58Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "2e9cd8fc3db9ae5a5dacfc398d2982f3179bd675", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/2e9cd8fc3db9ae5a5dacfc398d2982f3179bd675", "message": "Merge branch 'master' into ccr_data_stream_support", "committedDate": "2020-09-23T02:23:40Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "715dfe3532cbfc17fc84512ba6be168b973e0449", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/715dfe3532cbfc17fc84512ba6be168b973e0449", "message": "Merge remote-tracking branch 'es/master' into ccr_data_stream_support", "committedDate": "2020-09-28T11:43:15Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5NzkzNjA0Mg==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/61993#discussion_r497936042", "bodyText": "Can you add a test where an auto-follow pattern is added after the leader cluster has created a data stream?", "author": "dnhatn", "createdAt": "2020-10-01T02:01:37Z", "path": "x-pack/plugin/ccr/qa/multi-cluster/src/test/java/org/elasticsearch/xpack/ccr/AutoFollowIT.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -163,12 +172,142 @@ public void testPutAutoFollowPatternThatOverridesRequiredLeaderSetting() throws\n         );\n     }\n \n+    public void testDataStreams() throws Exception {", "originalCommit": "715dfe3532cbfc17fc84512ba6be168b973e0449", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5Nzk0MzQ3NA==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/61993#discussion_r497943474", "bodyText": "Can we make this change directly in RestoreService?
