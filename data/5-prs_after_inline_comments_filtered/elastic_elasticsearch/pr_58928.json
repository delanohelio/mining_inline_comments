In general, they each appear in different event types.\nuser.run_as.realm only appears for run_as_granted and run_as_denied events. user.run_by.realm and realm fields are not present for such events. user.realm shows the authenticating realm name.\nFor access_granted and access_denied events, user.* fields always represent the attributes of the effective user.

It is still useful for authentication_failed events, when no other user.* fields are present, because there is no user yet (the user is built after authentication succeeded).\n\nTo clarify, authentication_success currently (before this PR) includes only the realm field from your list, but it also contains the user.name attribute of the user. realm contains the realm that did the authentication, and user.name contains the effective authentication (it could be the looked up username, authentication_success is generated after a possible run_as_granted). In this PR I propose we remove the realm field, and rely on the strategy we use for access_granted authz events, where the user.* fields always represent the attributes of the effective user and user.run_by.* the attributes of the authenticated user.\nAlthough I believe it is a good change, I am pushing for it now because, in order to better support the API Keys, the realm would contain the effective realm name, because the authenticating realm name is not recorded on API key creation.
