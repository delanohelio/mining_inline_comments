The current approach is to have a single POST endpoint that Kibana can call for both HTTP-Redirect and HTTP-Post bindings from the idP, i.e. Kibana acts as a multiplexer here. So what ES receives is an uniform POST message. The handler (SamlLogoutResponseHandler) is able to tell whether the paylod (content) itself is signed and proceeds as HTTP-Redirect. If it is not, it proceeds as HTTP-POST and requires the XML to be signed, which is more or less similar to what SamlAuthenticator does.\nI can be convinced to have two separate endpoints, one for HTTP-Redirect and one for HTTP-POST. If we do that, we can even have two separate Request classes as well. But if we choose to have a single endpoint, I'd prefer to also not differentiate it at the Request object level.\nWhether we should have one or two end-points also depends on what Kibana can do (@azasypkin). My thinking is that Kibana will have to prepare the requset to ES anyhow, i.e. it has to add the realm and requestId information.
