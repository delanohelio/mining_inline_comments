However, this implies the user could include it but\nif the user tried to do so, they would get a failure as they would\nbe including a field with unsupported type.\n\nThis commit improves this by stating the reason a not included field\nwith unsupported type is excluded is because of its type.", "committedDate": "2020-07-13T14:12:38Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ1NDM5ODYwOQ==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/59424#discussion_r454398609", "bodyText": "This is good.
