It however seems to be a better choice comparing to the other choice, i.e. Add order into the settings parameter on caller side so that it can just keep using the existing constructor.\nThis approach should work fine for tests. But in production code, the settings object is referenced in many other classes, e.g. Environment, Realms, etc. So when adding FileRealm (in Realms.java), if we modify the settings object to add order, we will need to do something like the follows:\nvar newSettings = Settings.Builder().put(settings).build();\n... new RealmConfig(..., newSetings, ...), ...;\nSo the newSettings is now passed into RealmConfig which will store a reference to it. Now we have two Settings object across the application. They are mostly identical, only differs in the order parameter. And this is just FileRealm, the same applies to native realm, for which we will have a third settings. I personally think this is worse than adding a new constructor. That is why the new constructor is added so we can avoid manipulating the settings object.\nWith above being said, I realise it is making an assumption that the logic for mandating the order setting resides in the RealmConfig class. If we can move away from this assumption, like you suggested, enforce the logic in Realms.initRealms, we can probably make the change set much smaller.\nInitially I thought about adding the logic into Security but that was too high level. So we decided to add it in RealmConfig itself, where it is low level the logic is close to its natural owner. But maybe we need something in between.
