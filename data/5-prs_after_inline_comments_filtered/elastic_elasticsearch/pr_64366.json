This didn't happen before because previously we never rewrote\nthe current leaf. The fix involves cleaning up the state that the\ndeferring collector uses if we end up removing all hits.\n\nThis requires some super intimate knowledge of how\n`BestBucketsDeferringCollector` works so I decided to move the\nimplementation of that mergin from `MergingBucketsDeferringCollector`\ninto `BestBucketsDeferringCollector`. This means that\n`MergingBucketsDeferringCollector` is pretty much empty now. So I've\ndeprecated it and will remove it entirely in an subsequent change.\n\nCloses #64356", "committedDate": "2020-10-29T16:52:00Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxNDQ5MjMxMg==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/64366#discussion_r514492312", "bodyText": "I know you just transcribed this from the old comment, but it might be nice to define \"best\" here.
