Because it uses that sorting for filtering to the\ntop-n it tries not to construct all of the buckets for the child\naggregations. This has its own interesting problem around reduction, but\nthey aren't super relevant to this change. This change moves that\noptimization from the `TermsAggregator` and into the aggregators being\nsorted on. This should make it more clear what is going on and it\nunifies this optimization with validating the sort.\n\nFinally, this should enable some minor optimizations to save a few\ncomparisons when sorting multi-valued buckets. I'll get those in a\nfollow up because they are now *fairly* obvious.
