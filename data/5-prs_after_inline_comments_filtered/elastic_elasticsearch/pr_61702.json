Large PRs are hard to be exhaustive. They also tend to run for longer and hence people are more easily to get less focused. On the other hand, smaller PRs are easier to get nitpicked since there aren't many things to talk about. It's a different level of zooming due to the PR sizes( and possibly human nature?). In an ideal world, I'd prefer every PR to be small. But that's pratically impossible. Overall, I don't think what we are doing is perfect, but it is not seriously flawed either.", "author": "ywangd", "createdAt": "2020-09-03T03:46:34Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4MDgwNDcwNQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "08da2d413652a512debd29f48b711b4df62223c3", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/08da2d413652a512debd29f48b711b4df62223c3", "message": "Add test for large # of issuers", "committedDate": "2020-09-03T03:37:29Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "d293233da02571f4d85b2809eeacc677c731ee95", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/d293233da02571f4d85b2809eeacc677c731ee95", "message": "Merge branch 'master' into ssl-diagnostics-empty-trust", "committedDate": "2020-09-03T03:37:50Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "3672afc10c2e5d697ab5b138ae88b0ae9e0faf8b", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/3672afc10c2e5d697ab5b138ae88b0ae9e0faf8b", "message": "Merge branch 'master' into ssl-diagnostics-empty-trust", "committedDate": "2020-09-18T04:01:48Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "e46bd7f0a309a02dd1dc086eaa1f810031b04a0b", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/e46bd7f0a309a02dd1dc086eaa1f810031b04a0b", "message": "Add tests for unknown issuers", "committedDate": "2020-09-18T04:12:29Z", "type": "commit"}]}
