This\nshould eventually result in a reproduction of the failure in #61437 that\nwill let us analyse what's really going on there and help us fix it.", "committedDate": "2020-08-24T07:02:05Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ3NTM4ODI2Nw==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/61455#discussion_r475388267", "bodyText": "NB not really the generic threadpool, we're using the DeterministicTaskQueue to run on a single thread here.", "author": "DaveCTurner", "createdAt": "2020-08-24T07:17:01Z", "path": "test/framework/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/cluster/service/FakeThreadPoolMasterService.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -157,7 +157,20 @@ public void onFailure(Exception e) {\n                     scheduleNextTaskIfNecessary();\n                 }\n             }\n-        }, wrapAckListener(ackListener));\n+        };\n+        threadPool.generic().execute(threadPool.getThreadContext().preserveContext(new Runnable() {", "originalCommit": "5d90a31347141005c243123757f984e403bffe2b", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "aca705cfbdd218b6abb7531cd8fd471828a6595e", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/aca705cfbdd218b6abb7531cd8fd471828a6595e", "message": "Run both tasks in unit tests", "committedDate": "2020-08-24T08:36:02Z", "type": "commit"}]}
