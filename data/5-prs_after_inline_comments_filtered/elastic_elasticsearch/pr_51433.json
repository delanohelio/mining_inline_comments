We recently introduced the ability to install plugins in a\nsingle invocation of the install plugin command. Using this can save\nsubstantial time starting up JVMs. This commit changes the build\ninfrastructure to install multiple plugins at once when building\nclusters for integration tests.\n\nFor the docs integration tests in particular, where we install many\nplugins, this change makes a substantial difference. On my laptop, prior\nto this change, installing the plugins sequentially took 115\nseconds. After this change, it takes 14 seconds.", "committedDate": "2020-01-24T17:05:10Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3MDc0NjM2Mw==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/51433#discussion_r370746363", "bodyText": "Is this intermediary collection really necessary?
