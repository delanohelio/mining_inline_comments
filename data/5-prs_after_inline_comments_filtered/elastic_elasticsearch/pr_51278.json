These methods are used by the AssignmentNode to do the majority of the work. AssignmentNode is also responsible for two additional items - compound assignment and a value being read from either pre or post assignment (++ and -- operator or  x = y = z where y must be read from post assignment). To do this all the storeable nodes follow a common pattern to do compound assignment, etc. This requires knowledge of how many ASM stack elements have been placed on the stack in order to access the actual value which is what accessElementCount is returning. As an example in this case, BraceSubNode may refer to an array access where on the stack the array reference along with the index is placed prior to accessing the actual value. accessElementCount refers to these two values and returns 2. This allows for some shortcutting by AssignmentNode to re-read the value if necessary. Take for instance x.y.z[2] += 1;. To access z[2], we have already accessed x and y. If we didn't shortcut straight to z[2] again to write the value we would have to double access x and y. Hopefully, this makes some sense.\nEdit: I don't want to expend too much effort here adding additional comments because the intention with further refactoring is for this specific code to go away in favor of storeable nodes getting more responsibility from assignment.", "author": "jdconrad", "createdAt": "2020-01-23T21:34:34Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3MDM1MzE0Mw=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "56a366ad2beac268810914237d99b084ccad1d7d", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/56a366ad2beac268810914237d99b084ccad1d7d", "message": "added some comments for cat", "committedDate": "2020-01-23T21:41:00Z", "type": "commit"}]}
