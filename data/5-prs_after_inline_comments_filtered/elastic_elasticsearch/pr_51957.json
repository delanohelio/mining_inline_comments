This introduces a scenario where the mapping\nlistener thread will attempt to finish the request and fsync. This\nthread can potentially be a transport thread. This commit fixes this\nissue by forcing the finish action to happen on the write threadpool.\n\nFixes #51904.", "committedDate": "2020-02-05T17:49:26Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3NTQzNDE3MQ==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/51957#discussion_r375434171", "bodyText": "I was thinking that rather than scheduling only finishRequest on the write thread pool, we should execute the entirety of onRejection on the write thread pool (and still forcing execution, since rejecting execution here would be very bad): \n  \n    \n      elasticsearch/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/action/bulk/TransportShardBulkAction.java\n    \n    \n         Line 160\n      in\n      3ad8aa6\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n        \n          \n           ActionListener.wrap(v -> executor.execute(this), this::onRejection)) == false) { \n        \n    \n  \n\n\nThe reason I think this is because we're still doing work in onRejection that is linear in the number of documents in the bulk request.

The current \"direct\" handling kind of prioritizes the onRejection handling over everything else in the queue, which I think there is really no good reason for.\nLooking at various onRejection handlers, some call listener.onFailure and verifying that none of those do bad things is tricky.\nAlso notice that onAfter is also called in the caller thread when requests are rejected, this poses similar issues (not that I found a smoking gun there).\nFinally, notice that AbstractRunnable.onRejection by default calls onFailure.\nI doubt that we careful consider that onAfter and onFailure might run in the current thread when using AbstractRunnable and executing the onRejection handling on the target thread-pool would fix this, making it easier to reason about.\nThat said, I think this PR is good and I am not objecting to it going in.
