I was referring to the \"serialization\" part of the logging message, i.e. the toXContent method, where the message is prepared.

The objects must also be consistent among themselves. For example, check out the handling of the SetEnabledRequest and GrantApiKeyRequest requests.\nIn general, I've chosen the XContent field names in the context of the audit log that we've got; most commonly field names coincide with the XContent field names, but not always. Same for the nesting patterns.\n\nAlso on the topic of resuing the auditing message, there were talks about auditing into an index (or maybe some other connectors). Would it be a valid possible future reuse?\n\nIf, as initially planned, this feature would've been a particular case of \"request body auditing\" , then yes that would be a valid reuse case. But it's now a different thing. Audit records are a richer translation of requests in a friendlier format in the particular context of security config changes to be applied.\nSlightly off-topic, the index connector is not a suitable connector for audits as the buffering on the local disk is really required (we had something like that and we've deprecated it).", "author": "albertzaharovits", "createdAt": "2020-10-07T22:50:26Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5OTM0MjAxMA=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5OTM0NTE0OA==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/62916#discussion_r499345148", "bodyText": "Nit: technically, when the auditing happens, the config has not been \"changed\" yet.

Is there a reason we moved away from that idea?\n\nI started off implementing that but changed course midway. I believe there are good reasons for the change of heart. Let me explain:\nConceptually the request bodies and the audit events both contain fields, and the code in this PR is all about the mapping between the two. The code has dependencies on both the accessor methods of requests (and, optionally, on the toXContent method, which is used when indexing the object) and the \"setter\" methods for the audit event. After some prototyping, I've reached the conclusion that the \"mapping\" code is more dependent on the auditing part than on the request content part. The nestedness and the field names (some of which must be made all the way to the log4j2.properties file) are all examples of it; they are like this because they're crafted to present a consistent interface for all the security changes (eg \"user\":{\"name\" vs \"username\"), which is the being reason for this feature (the \"upgrade\" from the REST request auditing). It is useful to have all the formatting code in a single place. Consequently, the code sits in the LoggingAuditTrail class rather than the individual request classes.\n\nPutting this code into the Audit trail rather than in the requests itself increases the risk that we will change the implementation of a request object, but fail to account for that in the audit logs (new fields, etc).\n\nI acknowledge the worry, but the LoggingAuditTrail is now a consumer of such requests just like the action handlers; if you change the request you can track all the uses of the request class in the IDE and adapt all the consumers as well (not only the conventional consumer which is the action handler). It's not fool proof, but neither is a \"toString\"-like method, which you can miss to adapt when you change the class.", "author": "albertzaharovits", "createdAt": "2020-10-26T09:01:39Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxMTcwMjA4MA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxMTkzOTY1OA==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/62916#discussion_r511939658", "bodyText": "I've reread the comment and I think I came across defensive.

For example, a confidential field might be audited only as present or not, or audited under a slightly different name for uniformity in the audit context.\nTherefore, there's no advantage to placing the auditing code at the request level.

This means even when both realmName and userName are null, we should log them, because they mean all. But I think this is apparently too much. So the opposite approach, which I prefer, is to not log them on missing values.\nBecause of the internal leniency of the InvalidateApiKeyRequest, empty values can take multiple forms. It is a hassle to consolidate them. And as you said, the right place for the consolidation is in the Request class itself. But I don't think we should drag it into this PR. Therefore, instead of logging different formats of \"null\" value, skipping them at least has the benefit of consistency.\nEven though null has the practical effect of all here, I don't think it really is that special. In my opinion, it is quite obvious because all these variables are search criteria. If not specified, it's obvious that it should take no effect. Also strictly speaking, null does not mean all. It really just means \"missing\" because you will not see it in the final search query at all. The cluster privileges in RoleDescriptor is a different story because it is not a search query, so its meaning could be ambiguous when skipped. If anything, the RoleDescriptor's query field is skipped on missing value because it is also a search criteria.\n\nSo my concrete suggestion would be to use Strings#hasText here and skip empty values.", "author": "ywangd", "createdAt": "2020-12-10T13:39:11Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUzOTgzNTA0MA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0MjA4OTcyMg==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/62916#discussion_r542089722", "bodyText": "I would support cleaning up the request object so that it didn't support different styles of \"empty\" strings - it may be as simple as changing the setters to have\nif( Strings.hasText(arg) ) {\n   this.field = arg;\n} else \n   this.field = null;\n}\n\nBut, I'm not sure there's a good reason to squeeze that into this PR.\nI think the current logging is the preferred behaviour - or at least we should always print them as a pair, I don't have a string view whether we should output the match-all fields as *, _all or null.\nThe user and realm are a pair.

However, the Invalidate API Key API does not realy treat them as a pair in that 1) you don't need specify both of them; 2) their value absence is handled the same way as for other variables, e.g. API key name, i.e. the value absence just means the search critiera does not include this variable. So there is nothing inherently with this particular API that makes the two feel like a pair. For example, you can invalidate all keys belong to user foo from multiple realms:\nDELETE _security/api_key\n{\"username\":\"foo\"}\nIs this behaviour intended?\nWith above being said, I agree to output username and realm as a pair since this should be the norm.
