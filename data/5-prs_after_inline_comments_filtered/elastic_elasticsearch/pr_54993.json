During startup various consumers register the files that\nshould be watched by this service. There is behavior that might be\nunexpected in that the service may not start polling until later in the\nstartup process due to the use of lifecycle states to control when the\nservice actually starts the jobs to monitor resources. This change\nremoves this unexpected behavior so that upon construction the service\nhas already registered its tasks to poll resources for changes. In\nmaking this modification, the service no longer extends\nAbstractLifecycleComponent and instead implements the Closeable\ninterface so that the polling jobs can be terminated when the service\nis no longer required.\n\nRelates #54867", "committedDate": "2020-04-08T21:19:14Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwNjAyODI3Ng==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/54993#discussion_r406028276", "bodyText": "This schedule will still begin its first poll after the initial delay, which is the \"big\" gap for #54867.
