For\nexample, if the same exception such as a connect transport exception, is\nthe cause of repeated failures. Previously we were unconditionally\nself-suppressing the exception into the first exception, but\nself-supressing is not allowed. Thus, we would throw an exception and\nthe grouped action listener would never complete. This commit addresses\nthis by guarding against self-suppression.", "committedDate": "2020-03-08T00:17:40Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4OTMyMzM2MQ==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/53262#discussion_r389323361", "bodyText": "NIT: seems like there's a word missing here like \"this test [verifies] that the\"", "author": "original-brownbear", "createdAt": "2020-03-08T00:31:40Z", "path": "server/src/test/java/org/elasticsearch/action/support/GroupedActionListenerTests.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -133,4 +136,21 @@ public void testConcurrentFailures() throws InterruptedException {\n         assertThat(exception, instanceOf(IOException.class));\n         assertEquals(numGroups - 1, exception.getSuppressed().length);\n     }\n+\n+    /*\n+     * It can happen that the same exception causes a grouped listener to be notified of the failure multiple times.
