I was trying to make this test in REST yml tests, but yml tests don't have nice comparison of float scores (you can't set up delta, and also there are errors with double -> float conversions).\nI also considered adding this test in DistanceFeatureQueryBuilderTests, but then I need to work on the Lucene level there. But what I wanted to test is how ES parses this query and what scores are returned.  I could not find a smart way to do that in that test.
