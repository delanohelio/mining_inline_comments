This would\nmean it never got as far as opening the last named pipe, so\nthe JVM would never get as far as reading from the log pipe,\nhence a deadlock.\n\nThis change alters the connection order so that the JVM\nstarts reading from the logging pipe immediately after opening\nit so that if the C++ process logs messages while opening the\nother named pipes they are captured in a timely manner and\nthere is no danger of a deadlock.\n\nRelates #56366", "committedDate": "2020-05-12T18:45:08Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyNDE5ODAxMw==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/56632#discussion_r424198013", "bodyText": "Suggested change\n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n          \n            \n                    return !cppLogHandler().hasLogStreamEnded();\n          \n          \n            \n                    return cppLogHandler().hasLogStreamEnded() == false;\n          \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n?", "author": "przemekwitek", "createdAt": "2020-05-13T06:23:01Z", "path": "x-pack/plugin/ml/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/xpack/ml/process/AbstractNativeProcess.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -248,39 +260,43 @@ public ZonedDateTime getProcessStartTime() {\n     @Override\n     public boolean isProcessAlive() {\n         // Sanity check: make sure the process hasn't terminated already\n-        return !cppLogHandler.hasLogStreamEnded();\n+        return !cppLogHandler().hasLogStreamEnded();", "originalCommit": "c44420ab96be91f75d146d4a656766a56cf9e617", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyNDE5OTA4Mg==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/56632#discussion_r424199082", "bodyText": "Could we also have a similar method for input stream for consistency?\nprivate OutputStream processInStream();", "author": "przemekwitek", "createdAt": "2020-05-13T06:25:42Z", "path": "x-pack/plugin/ml/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/xpack/ml/process/AbstractNativeProcess.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -248,39 +260,43 @@ public ZonedDateTime getProcessStartTime() {\n     @Override\n     public boolean isProcessAlive() {\n         // Sanity check: make sure the process hasn't terminated already\n-        return !cppLogHandler.hasLogStreamEnded();\n+        return !cppLogHandler().hasLogStreamEnded();\n     }\n \n     @Override\n     public boolean isProcessAliveAfterWaiting() {\n-        cppLogHandler.waitForLogStreamClose(Duration.ofMillis(45));\n+        cppLogHandler().waitForLogStreamClose(Duration.ofMillis(45));\n         return isProcessAlive();\n     }\n \n     @Override\n     public String readError() {\n-        return cppLogHandler.getErrors();\n+        return cppLogHandler().getErrors();\n     }\n \n     protected String jobId() {\n         return jobId;\n     }\n \n     protected InputStream processOutStream() {", "originalCommit": "c44420ab96be91f75d146d4a656766a56cf9e617", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyNDIwMDI0MQ==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/56632#discussion_r424200241", "bodyText": "Why do we need both assert and if statements?\nIs it because asserts can get optimized away?", "author": "przemekwitek", "createdAt": "2020-05-13T06:29:03Z", "path": "x-pack/plugin/ml/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/xpack/ml/process/ProcessPipes.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -118,19 +119,35 @@ public void addArgs(List<String> command) {\n     }\n \n     /**\n-     * Connect the pipes created by the C++ process.
