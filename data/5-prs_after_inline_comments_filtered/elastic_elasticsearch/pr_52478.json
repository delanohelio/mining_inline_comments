We start with explanation that is user provided explanation for the script, and if it null, it is substituted by our standard explanation (line 143), so on in line 151 explanation is never null.\n\nMaybe it worths checking for a test that when the boost is != 1 and explanation is false there is no explanation returned regarding the boost?\n\nWhen is explanation is not asked (explain = false in a search request),  we will not even go to this method. This method is executed only when a user requests an explanation.\n\nAlso, why not return an explanation if the boost is 1, since it's asked by the user?\n\nI was thinking since boost is an optional

I understood what happened:\n\nBefore 7.5,  script_score query was using ScriptScoreFunction that was returning 400 error with a negative score.\nFrom 7.5, we have changed it to not use ScriptScoreFunction but forgot to add a condition for a negative score.  But  TopScoreDocCollector assertion is tripped, causing fatal error in the dev mode. But I guess we silence these assertions in a production mode  as we don't see any visible errors or error log messages.\n\nSo, negative scores were wrongly allowed only in 7.5-7.6 versions, so to me it doesn't look like  a really breaking change. But I think it is still worth to add a note with explanation in release notes. I will do that.
