While the op_type isn't copied over, this wasn't needed, because it was only used for enforcing that only new docs were indexed (no updates). This works, because when the version is copied over then the version() method is invoked (mainRequest.getDestination().version()), which delegates to resolveVersionDefaults(), that returns Versions.MATCH_DELETED if op_type was set to create.\nHowever with changes in the pr, the op_type is now also used to ensure that reindex can index into a data stream, so there is a reason to copy over the op_type.", "author": "martijnvg", "createdAt": "2020-06-10T12:23:16Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzNzMxMTM3OA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzODM0NTQ4Nw==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/57870#discussion_r438345487", "bodyText": "I would be inclined to remove the comment.
