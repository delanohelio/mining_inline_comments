All I did was take the default implementation and paste it into the 7.x source. That means that the same code ends up being run in any case, except now a delegate.toFile() call is removed, and that seems to change the context enough to fix the problem.\nI managed to replicate the problem that @mieciu found by running the an ES configuration from him against 7.x.
