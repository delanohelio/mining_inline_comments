Previously, we do not move the recovery stage from INDEX to TRANSLOG if we don't have the safe commit, which can be the case if the index was created before 6.2 or the global checkpoint is still unassigned. Here we expect a file-based recovery to happen, and we will move the recovery stage to TRANSLOG in the clean files step. However, if the shard has a synced flush, we won't execute the clean files step and trip the assertion.\n\nAlso, which part of the new tests show this issue, and is it something that can also be triggered with a single restart?\n\nYes, I will add it to the full cluster restart suite.", "author": "dnhatn", "createdAt": "2020-05-27T12:17:10Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzMDg3NDU0OA=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "e5d40773c316deb0605a8c3672e67e166eba3f73", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/e5d40773c316deb0605a8c3672e67e166eba3f73", "message": "fix test", "committedDate": "2020-05-27T13:03:04Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "21a302a47604cf18c701e194190dfd2b186976d4", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/21a302a47604cf18c701e194190dfd2b186976d4", "message": "add test to full cluster restart", "committedDate": "2020-05-27T13:39:08Z", "type": "commit"}]}
