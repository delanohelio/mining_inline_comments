For the operator, loadbalancing is not an issue, as the the backup/restore operation is always executed on a single kubernetes pod and the controller interacts with this pod directly.\nI agree that we can improve this situation though. We could utilise an internal cache to track the progress of a backup/restore state, including the node it's executing on.

IMO, the REST APIs should be consistent if part of the cluster resource, otherwise we run into various issues such as CORS (console can't call an internal server unless explicitly allowing in config), network (can't reach an internal load balanced server directly) and consistency (same URL returns 2xx or 3xx when using load balancer).\nOne way to solve it is to have every REST server accept the request and forward it to the internal node if the request can only be satisfied by a local node, but I think all these matters should be handled in a separate JIRA since it would make this PR a lot
