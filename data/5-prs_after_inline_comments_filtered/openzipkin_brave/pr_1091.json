This will help when we create a path to the request\nfrom the response, as it allows chaining to the method without a null\ncheck.\n\nNote: while it seems path would also always be available even recently,\nit has been found missing due to a [request availablility bug](https://github.com/reactor/reactor-netty/pull/998).
