If you're aggregating by hour, you'd still have 4 data points for the last year.\nBeyond these periods, it's becoming problematic indeed, like the only value retained for a day would be one close to midnight which is obviously not a good value to get an average, but it's 5 years in the past...

If you get 34567.122 kWh, multiply by thousand and store in a COUNTER.\n@kaikreuzer yes. But I was not only thinking of outliers but of values that have a large statistical variance. Imagine someone (not me but I\u2018ve seen people use that) who meters radioactivity. He will for sure not store the total number of counts (That\u2018s a useless value, If total dose matters we have other problems than data storage.), he wants to store \u201eper time\u201c. So his unit would be Bequerel and measure every minute. Each of these values will be very different (because count rate is low in any case). The average is a much better aggregation than last value, and that is true after an hour.\nThis is also true for fast changing temperatures (like central heating boiler temperature). Aggregating over an 15 minutes might lose turn-ons (turns on immediately at the beginning, runs for 5 minutes, temperature is nearly back to normal after 15 minutes, when the next LAST value is taken).", "author": "J-N-K", "createdAt": "2020-03-28T07:06:30Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5OTIzOTU1OA=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "fce14395065b690ab8496d176ec61cbeb4bb2aab", "url": "https://github.com/openhab/openhab-addons/commit/fce14395065b690ab8496d176ec61cbeb4bb2aab", "message": "changed from AVERAGE to LAST\n\nSigned-off-by: Kai Kreuzer <kai@openhab.org>", "committedDate": "2020-03-27T20:25:23Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "5a526a4c0b7cbd242dd9e5385ced803f1bb931d9", "url": "https://github.com/openhab/openhab-addons/commit/5a526a4c0b7cbd242dd9e5385ced803f1bb931d9", "message": "use AVERAGE for quantifiable number items and LAST for others\n\nSigned-off-by: Kai Kreuzer <kai@openhab.org>", "committedDate": "2020-03-29T10:27:12Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwMTgxMDA3Nw==", "url": "https://github.com/openhab/openhab-addons/pull/7234#discussion_r401810077", "bodyText": "defaultQuantifiable?", "author": "J-N-K", "createdAt": "2020-04-01T18:07:35Z", "path": "bundles/org.openhab.persistence.rrd4j/src/main/java/org/openhab/persistence/rrd4j/internal/RRD4jPersistenceService.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -364,9 +374,21 @@ public void activate(final Map<String, Object> config) {\n         // 4. granularity of 1h for the last 5 years\n         // 5. granularity of 1d for the last 10 years\n         defaultNumeric.addArchives(\"LAST,0.5,1,360:LAST,0.5,6,10080:LAST,0.5,90,36500:LAST,0.5,8640,3650\");\n-        rrdDefs.put(\"default_numeric\", defaultNumeric);\n+        rrdDefs.put(DEFAULT_NUMERIC, defaultNumeric);\n+\n+        RrdDefConfig defaultQuantifiable = new RrdDefConfig(DEFAULT_QUANTIFIABLE);\n+        // use 10 seconds as a step size for numeric values and allow a 10 minute silence between updates\n+        defaultNumeric.setDef(\"GAUGE,600,U,U,10\");", "originalCommit": "5a526a4c0b7cbd242dd9e5385ced803f1bb931d9", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwMTg0MTk1NA==", "url": "https://github.com/openhab/openhab-addons/pull/7234#discussion_r401841954", "bodyText": "Good catch - fixed it!", "author": "kaikreuzer", "createdAt": "2020-04-01T19:01:46Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwMTgxMDA3Nw=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "5765181352d3ec1df09900774fbc41ed87657ea4", "url": "https://github.com/openhab/openhab-addons/commit/5765181352d3ec1df09900774fbc41ed87657ea4", "message": "fixed variable assignment\n\nSigned-off-by: Kai Kreuzer <kai@openhab.org>", "committedDate": "2020-04-01T19:01:20Z", "type": "commit"}]}
