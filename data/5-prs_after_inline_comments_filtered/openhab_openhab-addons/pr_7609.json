I think we're just interested in determining whether that work-around code (or preferable some other fix in place of it) is still necessary. I don't really know the history of it. I just saw the comment \"in some rare cases we have to check whether a port really exists, because if it doesn't the call to CommPortIdentifier#open will kill the whole JVM\" in the Zigbee binding when I was looking for examples of using SerialPortManager:\nhttps://github.com/openhab/org.openhab.binding.zigbee/blob/fac0cb77e61edebf8a9b1204879314f710b1f5bb/org.openhab.binding.zigbee/src/main/java/org/openhab/binding/zigbee/handler/ZigBeeSerialPort.java#L139-L145\nI thought that a JVM crash sounded undesirable :-). The work-around seemed relatively harmless and inexpensive, so I included it in the alarmdecoder binding, and later in the lutron binding. I'm not sure if any others have done the same thing. Now that @wborn has discovered the workaround prevents RFC2217 connections from working, it seems advisable to get rid of it.  But only if the original JVM-crashing bug is gone.
