As soon as the access key is set in the thing configuration, this code will no more be reached and so the access key will no more be logged.\nThis is done like that in few other bindings, when the key is a required configuration setting which is provided by the device at paring time (hue or freebox bindings for example).\nOne alternative would be to not log the access key as this place and make the access key configuration setting ALWAYS visible in Paper UI.
