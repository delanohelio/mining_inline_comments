My confusion might come from the fact that we are discussing this in the remoteDeviceRemoved method.\n\nAll Samsung tv related services are removed in thingRemoved method\n\nYes, that's what I referred to above - it is the very same as what happens in the code of this PR, that's why I couldn't see any problem with the remoteDeviceRemoved method.\n\nSo, when MediaRenderer device is added, binding should check and create all Samsung TV related services\n\nThat should be easy to do in the remoteDeviceAdded method then. But it still is not clear to me why this solves the problem you mentioned initially: \"they don't publish SSDP alive message\". If there are no SSDP messages, we will only see a call to remoteDeviceRemoved, which falsely takes the Thing OFFLINE, but will never see a call to remoteDeviceAdded, which would bring it back ONLINE again.

Behaviour seems to be also service specific and that's why there are many questions on the forum like yesterday day everything worked fine and today I can change the volume but not the channel.
