We should reduce this overhead.\n\nModifications:\n\n- Create a StacklessClosedChannelException and use it to reduce overhead.\n- Only call ChannelOutboundBuffer.failFlushed(...) when there was a flushed message at all.\n\nResult:\n\nLess performance overhead when closing the Channel", "committedDate": "2020-09-01T09:45:30Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "195824f85143659c9779baddea57b7bc6cf63a0c", "url": "https://github.com/netty/netty/commit/195824f85143659c9779baddea57b7bc6cf63a0c", "message": "Use correct class as origin of the exception and fix testcase", "committedDate": "2020-09-01T10:09:14Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4MjA1NjgxMw==", "url": "https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10523#discussion_r482056813", "bodyText": "Could optimize even further by pre-constructing some instances and reusing them.
