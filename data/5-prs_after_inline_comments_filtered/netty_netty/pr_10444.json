As the result,\n`Http2MultiplexHandler#newOutboundStream()` will throw an\n`IllegalStateException` with the message that is hard to\ninterpret correctly for this use-case: \"Http2FrameCodec not found. Has\nthe handler been added to a pipeline?\".\n\nModifications:\n\n- Check that the parent h2 `Channel` is still active before creating a\nnew stream when `open0` task is picked up by EventLoop;\n\nResult:\n\nUsers see a correct `ClosedChannelException` in case the parent h2\n`Channel` was closed concurrently with a request for a new stream.", "committedDate": "2020-08-01T02:55:16Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "72425906d5668d44ba2095d1efdf276e8f1a42ee", "url": "https://github.com/netty/netty/commit/72425906d5668d44ba2095d1efdf276e8f1a42ee", "message": "Add unit-test", "committedDate": "2020-08-05T02:17:28Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2NTUxMTM3MA==", "url": "https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/10444#discussion_r465511370", "bodyText": "nit: add license header", "author": "normanmaurer", "createdAt": "2020-08-05T06:52:42Z", "path": "codec-http2/src/test/java/io/netty/handler/codec/http2/Http2StreamChannelBootstrapTest.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,126 @@\n+package io.netty.handler.codec.http2;", "originalCommit": "72425906d5668d44ba2095d1efdf276e8f1a42ee", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "6d7f366c6838073be957053656e7cde6c17785c0", "url": "https://github.com/netty/netty/commit/6d7f366c6838073be957053656e7cde6c17785c0", "message": "add license header", "committedDate": "2020-08-05T16:20:05Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "cdeeac764c5766261432d0d0835c90d6a4e2d3fe", "url": "https://github.com/netty/netty/commit/cdeeac764c5766261432d0d0835c90d6a4e2d3fe", "message": "Merge branch '4.1' into stream-channel-is-active", "committedDate": "2020-08-06T06:36:14Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "6898ae2ec11037e07d6c7f5950b7c87e8143b7b4", "url": "https://github.com/netty/netty/commit/6898ae2ec11037e07d6c7f5950b7c87e8143b7b4", "message": "Fix compile error", "committedDate": "2020-08-06T07:25:01Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "d1b1920825cc10a5c9180d022273c141f49fac6e", "url": "https://github.com/netty/netty/commit/d1b1920825cc10a5c9180d022273c141f49fac6e", "message": "Fix check style", "committedDate": "2020-08-06T08:58:25Z", "type": "commit"}]}
