Yet I do not understand how the prefix could solve the linked issues: Following the first link, this only makes the case for having clearly distinct environment variable names without relying on case difference - so if you have FHIR.some.variable set to a certain value then a malicious attacker could also analogously change the prefix casing to \"redefine\" that value by simply setting e.g. Fhir.some.variable, right? The second link makes the case for using pre-defined Java system properties and does not mention the usage of prefixes at all - and so at the end of the day it boils down to simply not use freely defined environment variables at all - no matter if prefixed or not, right?
