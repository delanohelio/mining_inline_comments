I played around with various Espresso tests but couldn't get something that worked nicely and actually drove this out. We still consider FormEntryActivity a no-go for Robolectric testing, so I didn't even look at that.\nThe new Activity Result APIs are really the answer here I think, but they are still in beta. Once that's stable we should be able to move our activity result code into components (like FormEntryMenuDelegate) and test the request and \"response\" in one place.", "author": "seadowg", "createdAt": "2020-12-09T13:52:29Z", "path": "collect_app/src/main/java/org/odk/collect/android/activities/FormEntryActivity.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -762,7 +762,7 @@ protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, final Intent in\n \n         // If we're coming back from the hierarchy view, the user has either tapped the back\n         // button or another question to jump to so we need to rebuild the view.\n-        if (requestCode == RequestCodes.HIERARCHY_ACTIVITY) {\n+        if (requestCode == RequestCodes.HIERARCHY_ACTIVITY || requestCode == RequestCodes.CHANGE_SETTINGS) {", "originalCommit": "187a90e46791b54c8314aee8391613141c9a28f8", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUzOTMzMjE4OA==", "url": "https://github.com/getodk/collect/pull/4289#discussion_r539332188", "bodyText": "Can we do the same for font size?
