principle, that is why most logic is included in JsonSchemaUtils (instead of what is done in other methods present in this template) , but in the code that remains in the template we are just  specifying params and calling processIntance to retrieve the allowed phases (and including there in the map if there is any).\nI think the logic that is currently in the template is the logic that is needed (there has to be some copy paste between this and spring  template anyway), because it seems natural to interact with ProcessInstance  in the REST controller  and not inside the utility class (which is defined in flow project, due to the lack of a better common place)\nInitially, (see my comment to Edoardo in this PR) I have included a jsonschema class in the api, but it does not reduce substantially the logic here (we still need to resolve processintance and call allowedPhases), so I remove it since api project follow a differnet inteface-base approach with no dependency with
