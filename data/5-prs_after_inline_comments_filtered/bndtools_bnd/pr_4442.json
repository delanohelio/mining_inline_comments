These defaults are version specific\nand the user can set a `-versiondefaults <v>` \ninstruction to select a specific version. This\nallows a user to upgrade to a new workspace but\nkeep the old defaults.\n\nThe idea is that new features are written to be\ndisabled by default. Preferably, this should\ndone with a scope model if application. That is,\nlike for example `contract *` . These instructions\nare _scoped_. By setting an appropriate default\nyou can enable these instructions.\n\nBy default, a workspace will read in the defaults\nof the current version. We maintain already \na current version in About. However, with the\n`-versiondefaults` instruction the user can pick\nan earlier version of defaults.\n\nThe idea is that we continue to add features but\nstrictly write them disabled. The version defaults\ncan then selectively enable them so that the majority\nof our users get the benefits. \n\nThe version default file will (5.3.0.bnd) will have\nthe full set of defaults and will therefore encompass\nthe previous version's defaults.\n\nHowever, an organization that upgrades their bnd,\nwill be able to remain at an older version feature\nwise.\n\nThis was mainly driven because an older workspace\nthat I had was upgraded. After the upgrade, the \nartifacts failed in the field because the maven\ndependencies were automatically added to the pom. Similar\nproblems happened with the new Java import and I \nthink I once messed up with the EE requirements based\non the Java class levels.\n\nThe prime advantages I see are:\n\n- A more consistent feature model (disable in code, \n  enable by version defaults)\n- Concise documentation of the presence of new features in \n  the version default file. This can guide users to\n  override the defaults in their workspace file.\n- A user choice to revert back to an older feature\n  set while being able to take advantage of bug fixes\n\nThis code should work as is in the Gradle workspace\nbuild. The gradle native plugin & maven need to \nsee how they get their current defaults. Since the\ndefaults were already maintained this way, I expect\nthat this requires no change but I know little about\nthese uses of bndlib.\n\n- Made versions ignore micro updates\n- added test cases & set version defaults for standalone \nand default case\n\nSigned-off-by: Peter Kriens <Peter.Kriens@aqute.biz>", "committedDate": "2021-03-12T09:09:06Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "eb7185b8822cb1fcbb64275abec64de0c13127c0", "url": "https://github.com/bndtools/bnd/commit/eb7185b8822cb1fcbb64275abec64de0c13127c0", "message": "no good deed of commenting goes unpunished :-)\n\n---\n Signed-off-by: Peter Kriens <Peter.Kriens@aqute.biz>\n\nSigned-off-by: Peter Kriens <Peter.Kriens@aqute.biz>", "committedDate": "2021-03-12T09:09:06Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"oid": "fc4148e838544d4112d11c19dd945e7c500ddc1d", "url": "https://github.com/bndtools/bnd/commit/fc4148e838544d4112d11c19dd945e7c500ddc1d", "message": "[versiondefaults] Version defaults\n\n\u2013 Fixed up comment\n\u2013 Comsetic stuff\n\u2013 Moved to 5.4\n\n\nSigned-off-by: Peter Kriens <Peter.Kriens@aqute.biz>", "committedDate": "2021-03-12T09:59:12Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "fc4148e838544d4112d11c19dd945e7c500ddc1d", "url": "https://github.com/bndtools/bnd/commit/fc4148e838544d4112d11c19dd945e7c500ddc1d", "message": "[versiondefaults] Version defaults\n\n\u2013 Fixed up comment\n\u2013 Comsetic stuff\n\u2013 Moved to 5.4\n\n\nSigned-off-by: Peter Kriens <Peter.Kriens@aqute.biz>", "committedDate": "2021-03-12T09:59:12Z", "type": "forcePushed"}]}
