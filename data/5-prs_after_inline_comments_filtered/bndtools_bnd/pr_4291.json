The newly-named method was requesting a minor version increment. What I didn't notice (at first) was that there was another baseline error at the class level flagging the removal of the old name and requesting a major version increment. I think ideally, in this situation, given that the minor version had already been incremented, the error flagging minor version increment should be suppressed and only the error flagging major version increment should be reported.", "author": "kriegfrj", "createdAt": "2020-09-04T01:06:00Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4MzA4MDk4Mg=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "a8cc08db040b531cb9313e1553f2e1cb6b4bef5a", "url": "https://github.com/bndtools/bnd/commit/a8cc08db040b531cb9313e1553f2e1cb6b4bef5a", "message": "[classindex] Properly handle binary class name\n\nFixes #4289.\n\nSigned-off-by: Fr Jeremy Krieg <fr.jkrieg@greekwelfaresa.org.au>", "committedDate": "2020-09-04T01:07:29Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "a8cc08db040b531cb9313e1553f2e1cb6b4bef5a", "url": "https://github.com/bndtools/bnd/commit/a8cc08db040b531cb9313e1553f2e1cb6b4bef5a", "message": "[classindex] Properly handle binary class name\n\nFixes #4289.\n\nSigned-off-by: Fr Jeremy Krieg <fr.jkrieg@greekwelfaresa.org.au>", "committedDate": "2020-09-04T01:07:29Z", "type": "forcePushed"}]}
