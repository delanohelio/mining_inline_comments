This\ncaused extraneous spaces to be at the end sometimes.\n\nThis trims the Main-Class and Bundle-Version now.\n\nAlso unrolled a stream loop because the check for\ncapabilities was 20 levels deep in a stream. This makes it impossible to single step or debug.\n\nUnless there  is a demonstrable _and_ significant speed gain we should stop replacing plain old loops by streaming. Not only because it is hard to debug, it also looses the earlier context when you want to report something. Maybe if Java had true closures and no checked exception it might have been useful.\n\n\n\n\n\nSigned-off-by: Peter Kriens <Peter.Kriens@aqute.biz>", "committedDate": "2020-12-18T08:29:57Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0NTg0NzAwNA==", "url": "https://github.com/bndtools/bnd/pull/4457#discussion_r545847004", "bodyText": "Well you lost an nice performance fix of using ResourceUtils.matcher(requirement). requirement never changes in the loop, but ResourceUtils.matches(requirement, c) keeps recomputing the filter object every time through the O(n^2) loop.
