Regular GC task fails due to concurrent list modification and the stale versions are not removed at all.\n2. If, by coincident, there is newer version in the list other then the current version, then because of the modification of the list inside the loop, the final element (the newer version) won't be filtered but being left in the to-be-removed list. Then the GC task removes the most recent version. For example,\n  a) Input, current version \"2\"\n  b) Children = [1, 2, 3]\n  c) The task avoids checking \"2\", so the list for loop is: [1, 3]\n  d) When check \"1\", it is removed from the list. So the list becomes [3]. Then the loop ends, because the first item has already been looped from the for iteration perspective.\n  e) The version to be removed is \"3\"!\n\nThis PR fix the issue by avoiding concurrent modification.
