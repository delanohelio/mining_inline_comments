For every new job config, its workflow is added; for ever job config that doesn't exist in the jobqueue's dag (seems to be duplicate with the first part of logic), its workflow is added.\nWith dangling jobs, their jobConfigs are never deleted, so this section is activated all the time and the workflow, if exists, will have its DAG refreshed all the time. The problem is detailed in PR description.\nI don't think the extra logic for new job config or for the race condition makes much sense, given that a new logic which compares WorkflowConfig version is in place - if a new job is added, eventually the DAG will be updated, which will cause a version change and a runtime dag refresh.", "author": "NealSun96", "createdAt": "2020-11-03T03:52:34Z", "path": "helix-core/src/main/java/org/apache/helix/common/caches/TaskDataCache.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -116,33 +116,6 @@ public synchronized boolean refresh(HelixDataAccessor accessor,\n       }\n     }\n \n-    // The following 3 blocks is for finding a list of workflows whose JobDAGs have been changed", "originalCommit": "1ccbea19fd38c9e5abe9333ad2ffc81502404444", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUxNjgyOTkwNQ==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/1508#discussion_r516829905", "bodyText": "Maybe this comment needs to be changed.
