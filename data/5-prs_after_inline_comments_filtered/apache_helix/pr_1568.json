Note that all new assignment is happening when TargetState is START in handleAdditionTaskAssigment. If not, then assignment logic does not exist and will not be considered. We need to somehow manage this case before that. Note that when the live instance is gone, the controller does not see anything on the instance. I cannot find a better way to achieve this.
