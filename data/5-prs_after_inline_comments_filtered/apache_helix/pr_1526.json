This is the benefit. If we don\u2019t want it, reset in reconnect is unnecessary.\n\nNow, there are multiple places to change the method:\n\nreconnect / close, invalidate the cache: method = null\nin getChildren:\na. if method == null: lookup. else: continue to use the cached method.\nb. if method is unimplemented in server, fallback\n\nWith this strategy, we only have one place in getChildren to lookup the paginated method. Only the case is not able to dynamically detected: server upgrades to pagination from non pagination and there is no session re-establish.

The purpose of resetting is for client has pagination zk version first, and then zk server upgrades, so client can reset and detect server supports it then client can start to use pagination. But it could not cover all cases, like if servers can upgrade really fast without expiring client session, client can still not detect server\u2019s upgrade. So I think the right way is, if we want to onboard pagination, always expect server upgrades first then client. Vice versa, pagination is not leveraged in helix client.\n\n2 is doable, but I prefer 3, because we always follow the rule: \"if we want to onboard pagination, always expect server upgrades first then client\".  2 is not transparent or consistent: sometimes it can detect and sometimes not.\nWhat do you think?", "author": "huizhilu", "createdAt": "2020-12-17T06:42:15Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0NDc1ODQwOQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "4bad6d3db982ce3ce75f2937f2eacab8917ae73f", "url": "https://github.com/apache/helix/commit/4bad6d3db982ce3ce75f2937f2eacab8917ae73f", "message": "Remove method cache reset", "committedDate": "2020-12-17T06:45:06Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "9745b3bbf643398ece32dc7a366988389de65a7d", "url": "https://github.com/apache/helix/commit/9745b3bbf643398ece32dc7a366988389de65a7d", "message": "Add test for zkConnection and address comments", "committedDate": "2020-12-17T23:55:24Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"oid": "5d4c7343596a691dc0a595ccfb23cdcc33ba2745", "url": "https://github.com/apache/helix/commit/5d4c7343596a691dc0a595ccfb23cdcc33ba2745", "message": "Add test for zkConnection and address comments", "committedDate": "2020-12-18T03:49:18Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "5d4c7343596a691dc0a595ccfb23cdcc33ba2745", "url": "https://github.com/apache/helix/commit/5d4c7343596a691dc0a595ccfb23cdcc33ba2745", "message": "Add test for zkConnection and address comments", "committedDate": "2020-12-18T03:49:18Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0NjAwNDU0Mg==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/1526#discussion_r546004542", "bodyText": "Would this cause problem if default is enabled?
