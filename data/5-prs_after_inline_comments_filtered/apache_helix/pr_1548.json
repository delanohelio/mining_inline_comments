The logic looks to be valid even after this change.\nThe concerning part is that there are some duplicate checks here and there. For example,\n  // Allow tasks eligible for scheduling\n  if (state == null || state == TaskPartitionState.STOPPED\n      || state == TaskPartitionState.TIMED_OUT || state == TaskPartitionState.TASK_ERROR\n      || state == TaskPartitionState.DROPPED) {\n    filteredTasks.add(partitionNumber);\n  }\n  // Allow tasks whose assigned instances are no longer live for rescheduling\n  if (isTaskNotInTerminalState(state)) {\n    ...\n  }\n\nThis section checks for different state combinations and then react differently. First of all, it is hard for the reviewers to follow the logic. Secondly, it is very easy for the coder to introduce bugs since the combinations are separately done in different private methods.\nIs it possible that we conclude all the states check within 3 or 4 methods? Or we need to clean up the state.
