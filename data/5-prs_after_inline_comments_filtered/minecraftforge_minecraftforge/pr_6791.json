I could extend it to the other equipment slots but i was trying to minimize changes to vanilla code. And if i am extending it to the other equipment slots what about an item that lets you fly when you are holding it? Or some sort of charm that works as long as its in your inventory like an angel ring? What about things like baubles? Where do you draw the line?\nThis is why i decided to keep it as simple as possible. This is where something like the elytra entity attribute that was attempted in #4958 would be useful as its is much more flexible. But its also a lot more complicated requiring much more invasive changes to vanilla code which is probably why it never got merged.\nPeople have been trying to get elytra support merged since 2018. I just want to create a simple pr that might actually get merged.\nThat said i can see how it may be worth while expanding this to the other equipment slots. I will let lex or mezz decide if its worth the extra complexity before i make the change.", "author": "brandon3055", "createdAt": "2020-06-23T11:31:19Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0MzU3MDg5Mg=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "a56d72e168cddeb113b4cc2850bd2bbec2fd35e5", "url": "https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/commit/a56d72e168cddeb113b4cc2850bd2bbec2fd35e5", "message": "Added custom elytra support", "committedDate": "2020-08-04T08:02:32Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "a56d72e168cddeb113b4cc2850bd2bbec2fd35e5", "url": "https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/commit/a56d72e168cddeb113b4cc2850bd2bbec2fd35e5", "message": "Added custom elytra support", "committedDate": "2020-08-04T08:02:32Z", "type": "forcePushed"}]}
