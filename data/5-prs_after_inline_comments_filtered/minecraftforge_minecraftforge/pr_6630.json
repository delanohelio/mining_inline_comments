That flag is used to switch between glfwPollEvents being called on the secondary thread or it not being called at all and on which thread the window and context are created on (as Win32 requires polling to be on the same thread that it was created on). If glfwPollEvents could be called during the loading then these two paths could be unified under the glfw's defined behavior.\nThere is no additional blocking going on from these commits, all that is moved to the main thread is the creation and deletion of the context, previously deletion was waited upon anyway so only creation is new work/wait time for the main thread. Actual rendering and context binding still always takes place on a second thread.\nIn regards to the GL context creation, tldr: no. The OpenGL specification describes behavior with multiple contexts and shared contexts, and in this case the entire context and glfw are cleaned up before Minecraft creates it's context. With GLFW it is actually undefined behavior to create an OpenGL context on any thread but the main thread.", "author": "RogueLogix", "createdAt": "2020-04-17T01:45:52Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwOTkzNjQ4MQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwOTk0NjM1MQ==", "url": "https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/pull/6630#discussion_r409946351", "bodyText": "oh, i see the disable flag you are talking about, i didnt even realize that was there, let me correct that.", "author": "RogueLogix", "createdAt": "2020-04-17T01:49:48Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwOTkzNjQ4MQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwOTk0NzY4MA==", "url": "https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/pull/6630#discussion_r409947680", "bodyText": "disable flag added back in.", "author": "RogueLogix", "createdAt": "2020-04-17T01:54:53Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwOTkzNjQ4MQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "677e2104a0314a7092634a8874472969d4a7cb73", "url": "https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/commit/677e2104a0314a7092634a8874472969d4a7cb73", "message": "move handOffWindow down near start()", "committedDate": "2020-04-26T22:41:53Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "6a0b16817d3d5f4f85d8670c0dd63abc7a488490", "url": "https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/commit/6a0b16817d3d5f4f85d8670c0dd63abc7a488490", "message": "Move ClientVisualization to secondary thread", "committedDate": "2020-04-26T23:06:44Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "6a0b16817d3d5f4f85d8670c0dd63abc7a488490", "url": "https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/commit/6a0b16817d3d5f4f85d8670c0dd63abc7a488490", "message": "Move ClientVisualization to secondary thread", "committedDate": "2020-04-26T23:06:44Z", "type": "forcePushed"}]}
