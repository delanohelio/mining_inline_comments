It is a no-op for DISAPPEAR.\n+ * This is specifically for S3A filesystem and here is the rational.\n+ * This guard is used when deleting data files corresponding to marker files that needs to be deleted.\n+ * There are two tricky cases that needs to be considered. Case 1 : A data file creation is eventually consistent and hence\n+ * when issuing deletes, it may not be found. Case 2: a data file was never created in the first place since the process crashed.\n+ * In S3A, GET and LIST are eventually consistent, and delete() implementation internally does a LIST/EXISTS.\n+ * Prior to this patch, hudi was leveraging {@link FailSafeConsistencyGuard} which was doing the following to delete data files.\n+ * Step1: wait for all files to appear with linear backoff.\n+ * Step2: issue deletes\n+ * Step3: wait for all files to disappear with linear backoff.\n+ * Step1 and Step2 is handled by {@link FailSafeConsistencyGuard}.\n+ *\n+ * We are simplifying these steps with {@link TimedWaitOnAppearConsistencyGaurd}.\n+ * Step1: Sleep for a configured threshold.\n+ * Step2: issue deletes.\n+ *\n+ * With this, if any files that was created, should be available within configured threshold(eventual consistency).\n+ * Delete() will return false if FileNotFound.
