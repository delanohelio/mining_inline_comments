In the debug, it appeared that content of magicBuffer was incorrect, and steam offsets were off. Only happened when more that 1 files was scheduled to be processed. So, I didn't test all the variations originally (non static magicBuffer without seek and seek with static) as was in hurry to fix, so not sure which one actually fixes the issue. Agree that seek(0) is weird and probably non static is a fix.
