Though some care is required in plumbing that in, since key expressions are persisted in meta-data and things might rely on equality comparisons there.\nBut I was thinking of this as local to the these functions and therefore only aiming to take care of the ones for which it is responsible. I do understand that in some of the cases, the affected Then actually existed in the input and wasn't constructed here.
