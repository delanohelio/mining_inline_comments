This is both because it is impossible to atomically check if a virtual directory exists while creating a\n+     * concrete directory and because such behavior will have minimal side effects--no files will be overwritten and the\n+     * directory will still be available for writing as intended, though it may not be empty.\n+     *\n+     * This method will attempt to extract standard HTTP content headers from the list of file attributes to set them\n+     * as blob headers. All other attributes will be set as blob metadata. The value of every attribute will be\n+     * converted to a {@code String} with the exception of the Content-MD5 attribute which expects a {@code byte[]}.\n+     * When extracting the content headers, the following strings will be used for comparison:\n+     * <ul>\n+     *     <li>{@code Content-Type}</li>\n+     *     <li>{@code Content-Disposition}</li>\n+     *     <li>{@code Content-Language}</li>\n+     *     <li>{@code Content-Encoding}</li>\n+     *     <li>{@code Content-MD5}</li>\n+     *     <li>{@code Cache-Control}</li>\n+     * </ul>\n+     * Note that these properties also have a particular semantic in that if one is specified, all are updated. In other\n+     * words, if any of the above is set, all those that are not set will be cleared.", "originalCommit": "b26be3c89446d039ea27797daacaa5e68cc272c2", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "0d8f221e91c3a3df975a3429f7e130e60759f199", "url": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/commit/0d8f221e91c3a3df975a3429f7e130e60759f199", "message": "Fixed spotbugs NPE", "committedDate": "2020-02-12T22:50:29Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3ODkzOTc3Mw==", "url": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/8121#discussion_r378939773", "bodyText": "are these constants anywhere?", "author": "gapra-msft", "createdAt": "2020-02-13T15:38:41Z", "path": "sdk/storage/azure-storage-blob-nio/src/main/java/com/azure/storage/blob/nio/implementation/util/Utility.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -13,4 +20,59 @@\n         logger.error(e.getMessage());\n         return e;\n     }\n+\n+    /*\n+    Note that this will remove the properties from the list of attributes as it finds them.\n+     */\n+    public static BlobHttpHeaders extractHttpHeaders(List<FileAttribute<?>> fileAttributes, ClientLogger logger) {\n+        BlobHttpHeaders headers = new BlobHttpHeaders();\n+        for (Iterator<FileAttribute<?>> it = fileAttributes.iterator(); it.hasNext();) {\n+            FileAttribute<?> attr = it.next();\n+            boolean propertyFound = true;\n+            switch (attr.name()) {\n+                case \"Content-Type\":", "originalCommit": "0d8f221e91c3a3df975a3429f7e130e60759f199", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "7bddab6635258b76462c6c4ca3d04cc20b3fa4a1", "url": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/commit/7bddab6635258b76462c6c4ca3d04cc20b3fa4a1", "message": "PR feedback", "committedDate": "2020-02-14T19:31:35Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "69d0bf9658cd4d31c9bd83b711a1c36a699a7876", "url": "https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/commit/69d0bf9658cd4d31c9bd83b711a1c36a699a7876", "message": "PR feedback", "committedDate": "2020-02-26T00:07:05Z", "type": "commit"}]}
