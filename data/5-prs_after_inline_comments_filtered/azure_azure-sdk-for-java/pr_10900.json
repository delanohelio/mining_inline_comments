Best option would be to align with undelete on blobs, but since that only restores in place, it doesn't offer much guidance here. Perhaps the next best thing is to look at copy, which has the client target the destination and then passes the source as a parameter. I think what .NET is doing most closely aligns with that, and if undelete for blobs ever allows you to move the blob as a part of that operation, we should have the source be a parameter.\nI definitely think there should be an easy restore-in-place overload for cases where the source and destination are the same, so the customer just doesn't need to pass in a name at all. And I think we should rework the javadocs here to be a little clearer about what's happening.\nAlso, for the sake of consistency with blobs, I think we should call this undelete.

We should use the same name for everything and I've left that feedback on one of the .NET PRs.  In .NET it doesn't matter which way we move thanks to [EditorBrowsable(Never)], but I'd vote for consistency with whatever the other languages are going to call this.\nThe reason I like moving this method up to the parent client is because the return type makes more sense.  When I call BlobClientContainer.Rename(name), I get why you're returning a new client (if I understand that clients are effectively cloud pointers).  If I call BlobContainerClient.Restore() I have no idea why it's returning a new client instance (\"is it actually the same instance, or is it a new instance slightly different from my last one, or ...?\").  If I call BlobServiceClient.Restore(name) it's really easy to understand that the returned client represents the restored container.  I don't feel strongly about this if everyone else prefers keeping it on BlobContainerClient.\nThe one thing I wouldn't do is put it on both BlobServiceClient and BlobContainerClient.  That pattern is an on-ramp where we have GetClient/List/Meta-operations on the parent, Create/Delete on both, and everything else on the child.  If you want to explore expanding the set of operations on both, we should push the architects to clarify the guidelines around hierarchical clients because they're not all written down today.
