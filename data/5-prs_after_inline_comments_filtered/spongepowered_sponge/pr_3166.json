You are using a mob farm, where you 1) need to click at mobs' legs, while mobs are standing above you by 1 block, 2) there's a block that blocks line of sight between you and mobs' eyes, 3) you need to stand back 4 blocks (for one reason or another).\nWhat happens is when you do the click - interaction only happens client-side.
