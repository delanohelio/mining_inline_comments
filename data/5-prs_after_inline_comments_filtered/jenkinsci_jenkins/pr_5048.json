When do we discard snapshots?\n- * In one use case, it would be convenient to keep the snapshot of the\n- * last promoted/successful build. So we need to define a mechanism\n- * to veto GC of snapshot? like an interface that Action can implement?\n- *\n- * Snapshot should be obtained per user's direction. That would be a good\n- * moment for the user to specify the retention policy.\n- *\n- * <li>\n- * Configuration mechanism. Should we auto-detect FileSystemProvisioner\n- * per OS? (but for example, zfs support would require the root access.)\n- * People probably needs to be able to disable this feature, which means\n- * one more configuration option. It's especially tricky because\n- * during the configuration we don't know the OS type.\n- *\n- * OTOH special agent type like the ones for network.com grid can\n- * hide this.\n- * </ol>\n- *\n- *\n- * <h2>Recap</h2>\n- *\n- * To recap,\n- *\n- * - when an agent connects, we auto-detect the file system provisioner.\n- *   (for example, ZFS FSP would check the agent root user prop\n- *   and/or attempt to \"pfexec zfs create\" and take over.)\n- *\n- * - the user may configure jobs for snapshot collection, along with\n- *   the retention policy.\n- *\n- * - keep workspace snapshots that correspond to the permalinks\n- *   In ZFS, use a user property to remember the build and the job.\n- *\n- * Can't the 2nd step happen automatically, when someone else depends on\n- * the workspace snapshot of the upstream? Yes, by using {@link RunListener}.\n- * So this becomes like a special SCM type.\n- *\n- *\n- *\n- * <h2>Design take 2</h2>\n- * <p>\n- * The first piece of this is the custom {@link SCM}, which inherits the\n- * workspace of another job. When this executes, it picks up\n- * {@link WorkspaceSnapshot} from the other job and use it to obtain the workspace.\n- *\n- * <p>\n- * Then there's {@link RunListener}, which creates a snapshot if\n- * someone else is interested in using a snapshot later.\n- *\n- * <h3>TODOs</h3>\n- * <ul>\n- * <li>\n- * Garbage collection of workspace snapshots. \n- *\n- * </ul>\n- *\n- * @author Kohsuke Kawaguchi\n- * @since 1.235\n+ * @deprecated Unused.\n  */\n-public abstract class FileSystemProvisioner implements ExtensionPoint, Describable<FileSystemProvisioner> {\n-    /**\n-     * Called very early in the build (before a build places any files\n-     * in the workspace, such as SCM checkout) to provision a workspace\n-     * for the build.\n-     *\n-     * <p>\n-     * This method can prepare the underlying file system in preparation\n-     * for the later {@link FileSystemProvisioner.Default#snapshot(AbstractBuild, FilePath, TaskListener)}.\n-     *\n-     * TODO : the method needs to be able to see the snapshot would\n-     * be later needed.
