It's true that there's no updated trace state, so use the non-updated one.\nOtherwise, another approach that is similar to this one but seems a bit nicer is having this sort of method on the Sampler, accepting the decision with the parent trace state. \"update trace state\" is a business logic operation, it's nice if that lives in the Sampler which has the logic, a result feels like it should be mostly constant.\nFinally, maybe we can just live with an extra allocation if it seems like a normal getTraceState() seems like a more intuitive API.
