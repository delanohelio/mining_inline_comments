For comparison, the callback pattern is just defining an interface, so it's about as close to no-complexity as changes can get. Here we've added a lot of complexity, having to worry about synchronization to boot, but it seems the only additional feature is a custom executor, which is arguably not that important (our goal was to make the API usable from an async context). So unless we go a bit further, I don't see any reason to take this approach over a normal callback.\nThinking again (thanks for bringing up the point about complexity, I was forgetting it :) ), if we can only imagine a use case where there is a single callback that does something very simple like do a log statement, update a metric, then I'd still lean towards the callback pattern (but I'm still ok with the listenable Completable as well if others prefer it).\nIt does bring to mind another idea, what about dropping the result code completely? Just a single code seems quite limiting anyways, instead registering a listener on the exporter itself (not on export calls) seems like it could cover all expected use cases, possibly in a more controlled fashion? For example, Zipkin's reporter metrics callback could work well if registered directly on the Exporter, and allows consistency in handling success, failure, etc across all exporters.\nhttps://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/core/src/main/java/zipkin2/reporter/ReporterMetrics.java#L44", "author": "anuraaga", "createdAt": "2020-07-19T04:46:15Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ1Njg1Mzg2Ng=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ1Njk5MDUyNg==", "url": "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/pull/1428#discussion_r456990526", "bodyText": "I see a completable status as being useful in that the SDK should provide telemetry on a best-effort basis.

That would at least mitigate some requests piling up.\nAdditionally, an exporter might decide to avoid another export if there's one in-flight and also buffer a small amount.\nWith Akka-streams, writing an exporter is quite straightforward.
