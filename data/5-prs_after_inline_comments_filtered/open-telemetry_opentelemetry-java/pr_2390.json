This didn't feel \"that bad\" and I think it's important to preserve the vastly more common case of static config, setTraceConfig(TraceConfig.builder()....build()).

This is easy to use, just wonder if it's confusing for a builder to not return the precise type in its name. I guess not\nRename this one to setTraceConfig so it's an overload. I think having multiple overloads where only one should be used is quite common.
