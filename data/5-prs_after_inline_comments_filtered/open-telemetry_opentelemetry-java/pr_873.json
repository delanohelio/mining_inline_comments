Is this called once per collection cycle, or does this turn off batching? With this name, I would assume that it was end of the lifecycle, but from reading the code, it seems like this gets called once per \"harvest\". If it's the latter, then this should probably be named something like \"completeCollectionCycle\" or something like that.
