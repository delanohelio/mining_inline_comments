Though in practice, a stuck / time-consuming leadership movement is not common.\nNote that KIP-455 was about a new API for inter-broker replica reassignment tasks. Thus, its impact is limited to changes in starting, stopping, and listing them.\nI cleaned up the force-stop logic to ensure that it only applies to leadership movements along with a deprecation message for replica reassignments  -- i.e. with KIP-455 inter-broker replica reassignments no longer need force stop and intra-broker replica reassignments were already not using zNodes.\nOne side-effect of this change would be the loss of ability to bounce controller upon force-stopping inter/intra broker replica reassignments, which would have helped in case the controller itself is stuck for some reason. We can address that in a future PR by moving intentional controller bounce functionality to admin endpoint of cruise control.", "author": "efeg", "createdAt": "2020-08-11T19:05:14Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2ODI5NzA0OQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2ODI5NzIwOQ==", "url": "https://github.com/linkedin/cruise-control/pull/1308#discussion_r468297209", "bodyText": "Is this comment correct?
