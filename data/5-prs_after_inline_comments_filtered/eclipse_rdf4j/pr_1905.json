Also the pool size is meant\nto be configurable via FedXConfig setters.\n\nHowever, due to a bug in the construction of the ThreadPoolExecutor the\nsize is always set to a most 10 threads. This is because we have an\nunbound queue and set the minimumCoreSize to 10. In such setting new\nthreads are only created if the core size of the pool is not reached.\n\nWe now explicitly set the core pool size to the configured number of\nworkers, and in addition configure the pool in such a way that idle\nthreads can get destroyed. The idle timeout is set to 60s.", "committedDate": "2020-02-04T15:19:32Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3NDgyOTgzMg==", "url": "https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/pull/1905#discussion_r374829832", "bodyText": "Btw.
