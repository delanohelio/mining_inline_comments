TBH my main goal here is passing context to script engine factories upon creation of script engines to allow them to be tailored.\nThe cleanest way to do this would be to modify the engineFactory.createScriptEngine(scriptTypes.get(0)); call eariler in the method to add a custom ScriptEngineContext object as a second argument. However I chose not to do this because it would be a breaking change for existing implementors of the interface declaring this method (of course I could also introduce a 2nd interface and collect implementations of both, but that seems overkill). Or do you think this would be a better option? If not, I'll update the code to add context to whatever is there already (and create if not present) before testing on the DSLScriptEngine.", "author": "jpg0", "createdAt": "2020-11-19T22:15:29Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyNzA1MDc2MA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyNzI0Nzc2Ng==", "url": "https://github.com/openhab/openhab-core/pull/1837#discussion_r527247766", "bodyText": "(Updated code to only set context if it's not already been set)", "author": "jpg0", "createdAt": "2020-11-19T22:30:52Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyNzA1MDc2MA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyODIyMjQ5OA==", "url": "https://github.com/openhab/openhab-core/pull/1837#discussion_r528222498", "bodyText": "I think the current solution is fine, thanks.", "author": "kaikreuzer", "createdAt": "2020-11-21T17:44:06Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyNzA1MDc2MA=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "fd261bb1410563189d8f18247a1dd513acbb8195", "url": "https://github.com/openhab/openhab-core/commit/fd261bb1410563189d8f18247a1dd513acbb8195", "message": "Pass script context to script engines\n\nSigned-off-by: Jonathan Gilbert <jpg@trillica.com>", "committedDate": "2020-11-19T22:29:37Z", "type": "forcePushed"}, {"oid": "82a286f108fda7677f320573eb7a8858b06b2bdc", "url": "https://github.com/openhab/openhab-core/commit/82a286f108fda7677f320573eb7a8858b06b2bdc", "message": "Pass script context to script engines\n\nSigned-off-by: Jonathan Gilbert <jpg@trillica.com>", "committedDate": "2020-11-21T22:39:22Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "82a286f108fda7677f320573eb7a8858b06b2bdc", "url": "https://github.com/openhab/openhab-core/commit/82a286f108fda7677f320573eb7a8858b06b2bdc", "message": "Pass script context to script engines\n\nSigned-off-by: Jonathan Gilbert <jpg@trillica.com>", "committedDate": "2020-11-21T22:39:22Z", "type": "forcePushed"}]}
