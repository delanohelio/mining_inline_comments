I suppose we could make the parameter nullable in this case.\nThere is also usage in our tooling (recovery and checkpoint tools) that expects an instance of CheckpointManager to be shared within the same job. It does however seem like these can be easily refactored.\nIn addition to the two considerations above, changing the API would impact any existing open source customers who have implemented CheckpointManagerFactory for their own use cases. In this case perhaps we mark the existing method as deprecated and remove in a future version.\nIMO those are heavy changes to make just for one implementer of CheckpointManagerFactory to be able to toggle its consumer behavior.\nFor context, stopping the consumer after initial read is an optimization (https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/993/files) because BlockingEnvelopeMap buffers were being filled with messages that would never be read.\nAn alternative to this PR could be tackling that optimization differently. Fetch thresholds in BEM are currently configured per system. We wouldn't want to override this fetch threshold for the whole checkpoint system since it may overlap with other streams and impact job perf. However, if we implemented fetch thresholds at the system-stream / SSP granularity we could avoid this stop in some cases vs others bifurcation and instead limit buffering specifically for the checkpoint stream.\nTL;DR, my opinion:\n\nThis PR is the shortest path forward.\nModifying CheckpointManagerFactory API is unjustified.\nAlternative to this PR would be to approach the original problem of optimization a bit differently.", "author": "bkonold", "createdAt": "2020-04-03T19:25:29Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwMTEzODUzMQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwMzI5MzE2MQ==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/1327#discussion_r403293161", "bodyText": "I agree.
