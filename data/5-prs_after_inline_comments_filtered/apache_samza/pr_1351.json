IMO, it should be okay to assume Java synchronized works as expected\nIf it the latter, it is still undoubtedly hard but we can enforce them through other means with useful explicit comments around the code blocks & diligent reviews.\n\nTLDR; I am fine with not having a test for this scenario instead of having one that is indeterministic in what it tests.
