Maybe we could make that check part of ConfigurationProvider.\n\nIMO 1) is safer as new nodes can join existing cluster and queries shouldn't fail once Presto is marked as ready", "author": "sopel39", "createdAt": "2020-05-14T12:14:10Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQxMzgwMDQxNA=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}]}
