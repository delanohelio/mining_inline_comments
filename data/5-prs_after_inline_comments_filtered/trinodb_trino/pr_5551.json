Non-broadcast exchanges can transmit TBs of data.\nIn case of broadcast buffer it's more about storage of data so that build side tasks can start flushing. Broadcasted data would normally be tiny compared to hash-exchanged data.\n\nIdeally wouldn't we want the broadcast buffer to be atleast as much as normal buffer?\n\nI would consider 200MB a big buffer already.
