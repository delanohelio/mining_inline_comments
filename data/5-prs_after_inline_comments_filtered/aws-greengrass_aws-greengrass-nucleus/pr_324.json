Leave feedback on this recommendation by replying to the comment or by reacting to the comment using emoji.\nProblem\nYou are using a ConcurrentHashMap, but your usage of containsKey() and put() may not be thread-safe at lines: 115 and 123. Two threads can perform this same check at the same time and one thread can overwrite the value written by the other thread.\nFix\nConsider replacing put() with putIfAbsent() to help prevent accidental overwriting. putIfAbsent() puts the value only if the ConcurrentHashMap does not contain the key and therefore avoids overwriting the value written there by the other thread's putIfAbsent().\nMore info\nIf the key already exists, the code should throw an error at line: 116. putIfAbsent() returns null if the value did not exist and returns the value in the map if one already exists.", "author": "MikeDombo", "createdAt": "2020-07-21T19:14:34Z", "path": "src/main/java/com/aws/iot/evergreen/auth/AuthZHandler.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,225 @@\n+/* Copyright Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates.
