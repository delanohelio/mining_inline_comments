But this pattern conflicts with package repository material with name env.\nSo lets say,\nWe've defined a package repository with name env and a package with name my_package and specified the label template of pipeline  as ${env:my_package}. Even though, the package-repository material name is specified, it won't be resolved. Because, as per our implementation, we always resolve ${env:my_package} to environment variable.\nHence, in this scenario, pipeline label would be set to empty as there is no env-var with name my_package is specified.\nThis bug is only applicable for GoCD releases from v18.10.0 to v19.11.0 as the pipeline label pattern for package material has changed to ${repo_package} in GoCD v19.12.0\nFor GoCD releases from v18.10.0 to v19.11.0, we should say, for patterns ${env:something}, env is a reserved GoCD keyword and will always be resolved to environment variable.\nWith the above-mentioned behavior, for pipeline-label migrations containing ${env:something}, the pattern template will be treated as environment variable pattern and will not migrate : to _.", "author": "GaneshSPatil", "createdAt": "2020-01-24T10:46:53Z", "path": "common/src/test/java/com/thoughtworks/go/domain/PipelineLabelTest.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -282,6 +280,34 @@ public void shouldReturnEmptyIfThereIsNoMatchingEnvironmentVariable() {\n         assertThat(label.toString(), is(\"release-\"));\n     }\n \n+    @Test\n+    public void PipelineLabelTemplateMigration_shouldMigrateColonToUnderscoreForPackageMaterial() {\n+        List<List<String>> expectations = Arrays.asList(\n+                Arrays.asList(\"${COUNT}\", \"${COUNT}\"),\n+                Arrays.asList(\"something-${COUNT}\", \"something-${COUNT}\"),\n+                Arrays.asList(\"begin-${COUNT}-end\", \"begin-${COUNT}-end\"),\n+\n+                Arrays.asList(\"${repo:package}\", \"${repo_package}\"),\n+                Arrays.asList(\"start-${repo:package}-end\", \"start-${repo_package}-end\"),\n+\n+                Arrays.asList(\"release:v1-${repo:package}\", \"release:v1-${repo_package}\"),\n+                Arrays.asList(\"release:v1-${repo:package}:${svn}\", \"release:v1-${repo_package}:${svn}\"),\n+                Arrays.asList(\"release:v1-${repo:package}:${github[:7]}:${svn}\", \"release:v1-${repo_package}:${github[:7]}:${svn}\"),\n+                Arrays.asList(\"release:v1-${repo:package[:5]}:${github[:7]}:${svn}\", \"release:v1-${repo_package[:5]}:${github[:7]}:${svn}\"),\n+                Arrays.asList(\"start-release:v1-${repo:package}:${github[:7]}:${svn}-end\", \"start-release:v1-${repo_package}:${github[:7]}:${svn}-end\"),\n+\n+                Arrays.asList(\"${env:var}\", \"${env:var}\"),", "originalCommit": "e547219be3575278b9bb2577bb13488495f7c4d7", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3MDU3NTYxOA==", "url": "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/pull/7659#discussion_r370575618", "bodyText": "I understand.
