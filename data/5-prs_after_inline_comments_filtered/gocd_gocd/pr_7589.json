That means basically there are no defined resources on that agent. Instead of putting an \"empty string\" it's better if we only define this env. var. only if there's something to populate it. It actually would server users better as they can test for existence of certain variables instead of getting empty strings (and in case of non-existence they can default to a pre-set variable, like in Ansible's default () method).", "committedDate": "2020-01-16T07:07:47Z", "type": "commit"}]}
