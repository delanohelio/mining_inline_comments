We are actually extremely robust on determining whether a project is bazel by checking for the existence of dart/config/intellij-plugins/flutter.json. This bug is a case of code being written that forgets that not all Dart projects have pubspec.yaml or .packages file. A solution would be to audit the code base for all checks for pubspec.yaml and replace them with a helper call that is specialized for bazel workspaces.\nOne advantage of the current system is we don't have to make users configure the flutter sdk directory manually for bazel projects as we are able to determine it automatically. If we relied on specifying a flutter sdk directory we would have a chicken and egg problem as a user would have to have configured flutter before we could ask it whether a particular directory is a bazel or vanilla project.", "author": "jacob314", "createdAt": "2020-08-04T04:20:03Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2NDczMTI0OA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2NTEzNzk5Mw==", "url": "https://github.com/flutter/flutter-intellij/pull/4735#discussion_r465137993", "bodyText": "Understood.\n\nAudit the code base for all checks for pubspec.yaml and replace them with a helper call that is specialized for bazel workspaces.\n\nSGTM. I implemented a similar strategy for dartdoc where all \"package\" related operations go through an overridable class called PackageInfo rather than random code doing package processing.
