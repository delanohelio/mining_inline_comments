I wondered if it's safe for me to just always send this (if structured errors is enabled), or if that might result in errors for users with older Flutter SDKs. As long as it works in the latest stable and later it's probably not a real concern, but since I already have version checks on some flags, it's easy to add one if required to have compatibility with more SDKs.\n(I can test it if nobody knows the answer off-hand, I just thought I'd ask and save the multiple sets of downloads changing between versions \ud83d\ude01)", "author": "DanTup", "createdAt": "2020-05-29T18:18:08Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzMjY0ODg1Mw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzMjY3OTA2Mw==", "url": "https://github.com/flutter/flutter-intellij/pull/4587#discussion_r432679063", "bodyText": "Yes can you test and update me too?
