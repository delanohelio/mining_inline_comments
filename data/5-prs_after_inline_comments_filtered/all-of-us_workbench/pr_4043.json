My hope is that liberal logging provides some production visibility if & when this happens again, and liberal commenting will provide hints to future devs.\nMore generally, TDR and the rest of Terra have aligned on Dan Dietterich's home-built Stairway library which implements the Saga pattern for distributed transactions.
