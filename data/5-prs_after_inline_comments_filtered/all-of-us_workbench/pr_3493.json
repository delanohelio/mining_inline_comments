Or, better yet, most of this method might be better placed within the institution service, e.g. institutionService.isOperationalUser(dbUser user). That would centralize the logic within the institution package, and I don't think it would require adding any new deps to the institution service.\nSlightly tangential thought: I'm concerned that we're at risk of putting load-bearing system weight on the shortName identifier, which can be changed by operational end-users via the Institution UI at any time. This is a pretty serious red flag, and we should think about ways to make sure far-flung business logic can't be impacted by someone deciding in an admin UI that \"AouOps\" should be capitalized differently, or have a space added, etc. etc.\nI filed https://precisionmedicineinitiative.atlassian.net/browse/RW-4844 to track \u2013\u00a0I'd suggest following up with Joel & Karthik to align on a solution for this.", "author": "gjuggler", "createdAt": "2020-04-28T10:41:17Z", "path": "api/src/main/java/org/pmiops/workbench/rdr/RdrExportServiceImpl.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -435,4 +436,25 @@ public void updateDbRdrExport(RdrEntity entity, List<Long> idList) {\n             .collect(Collectors.toList());\n     rdrExportDao.save(exportList);\n   }\n+\n+  /**\n+   * Set excludeFromPublicDirectory to true if the workspace creator is an operational user i.e has\n+   * Institution as All of Us Program operational Use\n+   *\n+   * @param creatorUser\n+   * @param rdrWorkspace\n+   */\n+  void setExcludeFromPublicDirectory(DbUser creatorUser, RdrWorkspace rdrWorkspace) {\n+    rdrWorkspace.setExcludeFromPublicDirectory(false);\n+    verifiedInstitutionalAffiliationDao\n+        .findFirstByUser(creatorUser)\n+        .ifPresent(\n+            verifiedInstitutionalAffiliation -> {\n+              rdrWorkspace.setExcludeFromPublicDirectory(\n+                  verifiedInstitutionalAffiliation\n+                      .getInstitution()\n+                      .getShortName()\n+                      .equals(\"AouOps\"));", "originalCommit": "c57c5eb587423a6d7aac5722198c92e25f811863", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "70c4010ca2cf0f8ad196b173318af950fb026eeb", "url": "https://github.com/all-of-us/workbench/commit/70c4010ca2cf0f8ad196b173318af950fb026eeb", "message": "PR Comments: Extract logic for Validating opoeration user in institution service", "committedDate": "2020-04-29T00:50:21Z", "type": "commit"}]}
