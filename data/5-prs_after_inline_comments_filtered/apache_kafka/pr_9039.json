However, for this case, we don't need to do any redundant not-null check and we could just write:\nif (windows != null) {\n  ...\n} else if (slidingWindow != null) {\n  ...\n} else if (sessionWindow != null) { // we blindly assume that `sessionMerger` is not-null, too, for this case\n ...\n} else { // all `null`: non-winowed aggregation\n  ...\n}\n\nOr, (2) we do not \"trust\" the caller and do a proper check that the provided arguments make sense. And the existing code already has such a safe guard and does checks that not multiple windows are passed in and throws an IllegalArgumentException if the caller makes a mistake. I personally prefer to have a safe guard (especially on the non-hot code path) as it may prevent bugs. However, the current check is not complete, as it does not verify that sessionMerger must be not-null when sessionWindows is not-null; this may lead to a potentially cryptic NullPointerException later that is harder to understand.

My understanding is that there's no way for this check to be violated by any kind of user input, because this method is only ever called directly by Streams internal code with null hardcoded for the unused window types.

I think actually inserting \"the\" before \"window\" both times would clear it up: \"Windows are defined based on a record's timestamp, the window size, and the window grace period.\"\nAnother note is that because the second item in the list is so long, the structure of the list gets a little lost.

For example down on line 233 we are effectively checking for this case, and line 234 just happens to work correctly for it. But it's not at all obvious that we're even handling this case. Can we avoid the ternary operator when setting newAgg and newTimestamp and just use a normal if/else to explicitly set both of these for the special case?
