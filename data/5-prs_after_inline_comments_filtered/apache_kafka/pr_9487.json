Some trivial things -- eg the handler in the StreamThread is named streamsUncaughtExceptionHandler but it's actually not a StreamsUncaughtExceptionHandler. Also the usage of the return value; IIUC it's supposed to indicate whether to use the new handler or fall back on the old one. To me it sounds like if handle returns true that means we should handle it, ie we should not rethrow the exception, but this looks like the opposite of what we do now. Honestly either interpretation is ok with me, as long as it's documented somewhere\nDo we really need the Handler in the first place though? It's already pretty confusing that we have to deal with two types of handlers (old and new) so I'd prefer not to add a third unless it's really necessary. It seems like we can just inline the logic of whether to invoke the new handler or rethrow the exception, which would also clear up the confusion around the meaning of the return value.
