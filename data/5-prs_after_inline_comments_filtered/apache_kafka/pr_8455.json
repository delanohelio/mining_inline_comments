On the other hand, it's an unfortunate reality that the WARN level is heavily polluted by existing config warnings emitted when the framework creates Kafka clients and their unused configs get logged at that level, and it also seems highly unlikely that the worker would behave as expected in this case.\nI think if this were noticed from the first time it became an issue, it might even be reasonable to throw an exception and fail the worker on startup, but since we can't do that now without breaking backwards compatibility and opening that whole can of worms, ERROR level logging seemed like a decent substitute.\nThat's my thinking, if you're still convinced that WARN is better I'm happy to change it.", "author": "C0urante", "createdAt": "2020-04-10T00:18:50Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwNjUzOTk1OQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwNjYwNzcwMQ==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/8455#discussion_r406607701", "bodyText": "I think what you just described is precisely what I would consider something worthy of logging at WARN level. i.e. something went wrong and it is very likely that the application will behave in unexpected ways.
