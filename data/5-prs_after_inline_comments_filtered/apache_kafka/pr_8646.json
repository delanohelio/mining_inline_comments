In between the task may already be processed a bit on the first instance, and then after the second rebalance it was migrated and hence was restored a bit causing the listener to be triggered.\nI'd agree with @showuon here that we do not need to strictly forbids restoration not happening when starting the first two instances, just making sure after closing one instance we can restore the other up to the first batch is enough (which is already validated).
