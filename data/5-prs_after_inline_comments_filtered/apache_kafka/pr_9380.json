For one thing, the locking mechanism is per-process*. If you run two different instances then you can get an active task on one instance and the corresponding standby on another. They would each think they owned the lock for that task directory, and concurrently access it (leading to the FileNotFoundException if one of them deletes the checkpoint, for example)\n*on some systems. On others it isn't, but then you hit the opposite problem where a task is deadlocked because the other process grabbed the lock for its directory first", "author": "ableegoldman", "createdAt": "2020-10-08T01:02:05Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwMTM4NjUyMg=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwMTM5MzcyNA==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/9380#discussion_r501393724", "bodyText": "Currently, running multiple threads within an instance is not the same as running multiple instances on the same machine in the same state dir. I suppose technically if you could configure the two instances to have the same client UUID then the task assignor would make sure not to assign the same active/standby task to anyone on that machine, but I think there might be some unexpected side effects to running two separates instances with the same UUID.\nAnyways, if you're aware of the problem enough to configure the client Ids directly, you should be aware enough to just configure to use separate state.dirs.
