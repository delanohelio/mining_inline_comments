In the resulting segments, we want to create a segment for each day. Additionally, we want partitioning on some id column for query purposes.\nPartitioning by time column is first step. This doesn't affect segment metadata or broker routing. This is simply used by the framework, and it's scope ends with the framework. It's merely helping create date aligned input files for Segment generation stage.\nPartitioning by id column is second step. This is for queries. This will be whatever is in the table config. Only this partition will get set in the segment metadata.
