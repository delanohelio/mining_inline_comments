The value of the tests will be in the operations\nwe choose to test during upgrades\n\nConfiguration is done via YAML, and some sample yaml files and skinny classes have been\nprovided.", "committedDate": "2020-10-09T23:51:06Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwNDMwMDkwMA==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/6129#discussion_r504300900", "bodyText": "We may not need to print it out in the console?", "author": "jackjlli", "createdAt": "2020-10-13T22:45:27Z", "path": "pinot-tools/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/tools/compat/SegmentOp.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,95 @@\n+/**\n+ * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\n+ * or more contributor license agreements.
