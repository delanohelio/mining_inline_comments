Probably that's not a burdensome amount with this removal of --max-count, given this is a rev-list of a single file.\nWhen the spooled bytes are read later at line 402, they are read with the default Java charset, which is locale dependent on the OS installation. For hashes of a rev-list, that is perhaps always OK \u2014 but I'm just remarking since elsewhere in GitRepository, specific effort is made to use a correct charset (see newLogReader()).\nTechnically when read later at line 402, a BufferedReader is overkill, given that the bytes are already fully spooled in-memory.\nIndeed all the output of a Process (via exec()) must be read or else a deadlock could happen as one awaits the process exit value. The default spool does consume everything.\n\nI wonder if this is an opportunity to create a HeadHandler implementation of Executor.StreamHandler that is line-oriented (e.g. characters out of bytes), that demands a specified encoding instead of allowing the default Java charset, and that reads and stores a maximum number of lines and then just consumes and discards bytes (without bothering with character conversion) to exhaust the stream and avoid allocating heap.", "author": "idodeclare", "createdAt": "2020-02-27T02:29:11Z", "path": "opengrok-indexer/src/main/java/org/opengrok/indexer/history/GitRepository.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -389,7 +389,6 @@ private String getFirstRevision(String fullpath) throws IOException {\n                 ensureCommand(CMD_PROPERTY_KEY, CMD_FALLBACK),\n                 \"rev-list\",\n                 \"--reverse\",\n-                \"--max-count=1\",", "originalCommit": "01b9b774786bc4545231124bbf59829db6b601bf", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4NTI4MDE2Mg==", "url": "https://github.com/oracle/opengrok/pull/3056#discussion_r385280162", "bodyText": "Definitely good idea, I'd go for LineHandler (or similar) and then derive the HeadHandler out of it.
