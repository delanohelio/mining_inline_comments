So this summary should include a snippet from all the other notifications, which the user can tap to open your app.\n\nSo in our case users with pre Android 7.0 would only see that some number of podcast have some amount of new episodes, and the only action they have is to open the app. And this is only this way after somehow telling some part if it should create a summary at all.
