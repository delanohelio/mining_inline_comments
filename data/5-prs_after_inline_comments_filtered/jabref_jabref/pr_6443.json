The thing with the JabRef dialogues created by the show*AndWait is that they create the actual javafx dialogue in the method, so they can't be accessed later. I just found the createDialog method which would probably be the best to use here. It creates the dialog and takes care of some styling and such, and then returns the actual dialog which can then be shown and waited for.
