But, per the JDBC spec the default is true, so your suggestion makes sense. I'll make that change.\nIn the email thread, you had made a comment about setting auto commit to false by default within JdbcRowDataInputFormat.Builder in the 1.11 branch so that it would do the right thing for scans in postgres. However, that would conflict with setting the default to be true here. If someone expected that behavior in a 1.11 patch and then we add this, the behavior would revert back if they don't specify this option explicitly.\nIn general, I think that leaving auto commit enabled is the right thing to do. However, this is a config option specifically for doing scans, so I could see an argument for letting the default be false in this case. But, I can also see a good argument for making it match the JDBC driver default. I would suggest whatever is decided that it should be consistent, so if we set the default to be true here we probably shouldn't change JdbcRowDataInputFormat.Builder.\nLet me know which direction you'd like to go with this.", "author": "dforciea", "createdAt": "2020-10-10T14:55:18Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwMjc1Njg1Nw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwMzE1NTQ5Ng==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/13570#discussion_r503155496", "bodyText": "In the mailing list, I had made a mistake that I thought the autoCommit is false by default in JdbcRowDataInputFormat.Builder (but it is null by default), so I said it should be true by default.
