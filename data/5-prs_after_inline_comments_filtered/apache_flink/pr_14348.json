If we just accumulate 100 record, then with the current record size and the min buffer size (4kb), it's likely that only a few bytes are snapshotted and restored and also only individual buffers and not multiples. So, we may never see in the ITCase if multiple buffers are snapshotted/recovered at all and in the correct order.\nConsequently, we may also not see backpressure in all exchanges, but just the last exchange.
