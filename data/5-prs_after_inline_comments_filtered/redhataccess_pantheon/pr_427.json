This code worked, but it was inefficient.\nWhat you're proposing is to assume that the string of bytes coming from the request is encoded in UTF-8 from the start, which I believe is just not true. It \"appears\" to work but ignoring the specified encoding is unsafe. We really need to rely on the encoding that the request specifies being accurate.\nBut, you point at line 184 in ServletUtils as treating the input as UTF-8 by default. Honestly I can't really tell what's going on in the code. Method A provide Function B to Method C, which provides an InputStreamReader to Function B and executes it by wrapping a stream with a reader with a stream, but then Function B takes that stream and wraps it in another reader wrapped by another stream before finally wrapping it with another reader, and then finally applying that to the function that the developer specified, and the net result is...? Your guess is as good as mine. But you rightly point out that somewhere along the way, UTF-8 is brought in as a hardcoded default. I think THAT's what's mucking with our encoding and THAT's what needs to change.\n@carlosmunoz since you wrote the code in question, can you help untangle what's actually going on in the ServletUtils class and whether this is likely where our encoding bug actually lies?\nAlso tagging @xdavidson and @aprajshekhar in case they can help sort this out.", "author": "benradey", "createdAt": "2020-10-01T20:19:52Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5ODI0MDM0Mw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5ODQ5NjUyMQ==", "url": "https://github.com/redhataccess/pantheon/pull/427#discussion_r498496521", "bodyText": "So, there are 2 methods in that ServletUtil class: one takes a charset parameter, the other one doesn't (uses UTF-8 by default).
