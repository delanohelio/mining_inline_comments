It's easy to think that the isPresent() call applies to the child, when I think this must apply to the parent.\nI realized this when I was trying to get to the bottom of why your changes help to make things null-safe. For example, if you have this chain:\nChild.from(A)\n.toChild(B)\n.toChild(C)\n.toChild(D)\n.toChild(E)\n.getAsOptional()\n\n...and let's say that you get a null on C, then what the heck stops us from getting an NPE on the call to D?\nI guess the answer must be that there's some code that makes sure that once C becomes a NullChild, then the call to get D must also return a NullChild, and the same for the call down into E. The code that I have attached this comment to must be what does that. But like I said, it's easy to misread at first glance, so if I'm right then I'd like to request something that makes this look less innocuous and more critically important (which I believe it is).

This code is applying the Null Object pattern (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_object_pattern) to ensure the null-safety. So let me make a few points which may clarify your questions:\n\nIn line 64 above, the call to isPresent() is done on the parent (aka the current node in the navigation). Perhaps it would be more self-explanatory to replace that with this.isPresent().\nLine 67 above is where the \"magic\" begins. If the current node is not present, then any child will inevitably not exist either, and so a NullChild is returned every time.\nThe code never throws an NPE because it never returns a null, instead it returns a NullChild which has some specific behaviours to represent the fact that it is an empty node.\n\nHappy to add more context and javadocs, just let me know where so I can do it in the right places where things were not clear.
