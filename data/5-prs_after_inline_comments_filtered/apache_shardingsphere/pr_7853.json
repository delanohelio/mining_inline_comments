This pr is only to modify the routing way of the create function and create procedure statements and change it to all databases routing. \ud83d\ude02", "author": "strongduanmu", "createdAt": "2020-10-20T04:59:58Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwODE5NzQzOQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "3e12eb802ac84741f093bda89653420c9614095b", "url": "https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/commit/3e12eb802ac84741f093bda89653420c9614095b", "message": "resolve conflict", "committedDate": "2020-10-20T05:04:25Z", "type": "commit"}]}
