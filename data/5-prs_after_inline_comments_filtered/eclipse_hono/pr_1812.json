In that sense it is an equivalent to using @Autowired(required = false) on a field or method (using Autowired on a method parameter is mostly ignored, as written here. Another alternative would be to use a @Nullable annotation, which I also see as a good solution, which would require an additional dependency though (com.google.code.findbugs:jsr305 I guess we haven't discussed usage of that yet).", "author": "calohmn", "createdAt": "2020-03-05T16:32:24Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4ODM5NDM2Ng=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4ODQxNDcyMg==", "url": "https://github.com/eclipse/hono/pull/1812#discussion_r388414722", "bodyText": "Ah, I learn something new every day :-) In any case, IMHO you should document the NullPointerException ...", "author": "sophokles73", "createdAt": "2020-03-05T16:36:25Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4ODM5NDM2Ng=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}]}
