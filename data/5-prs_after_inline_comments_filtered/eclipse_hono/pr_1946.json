This, however, means that we would not be able to receive all commands for all tenants using a link source address of tenant/#.\nBTW the current implementation also does not check if the tenant ID from the command target address matches the tenant from the link source address used to receive the command. Instead, we simply use the tenant from the link source address with the device ID from the command target address. This effectively prevents applications from sending a command to a device of another tenant but does not detect programming errors if a device with the same ID exists in multiple tenants ...", "author": "sophokles73", "createdAt": "2020-05-11T08:55:26Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyMTQ2MDU5OQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyMzYwMDk3OQ==", "url": "https://github.com/eclipse/hono/pull/1946#discussion_r423600979", "bodyText": "This, however, means that we would not be able to receive all commands for all tenants using a link source address of tenant/#.\n\n(You mean command/#, I guess.)\nI've done a test here and the Qdrouter seems to allow sending messages with a to address, to which the sender hasn't been given rights for, as long as there are rights for the link address.
