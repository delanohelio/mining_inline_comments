With that change, a failure to remove a (potentially expired) entry will also not be traced as an error in the client anymore.\nI think the corresponding server method wasn't changed back then for compatibility reasons and following up on this later on was abandoned because of the new command router concept.\nI see that it may be confusing to use that client method with having the API definition in mind. I've changed the javadoc now to add a note about that difference.\nWe could also revert #1926 and just adapt the client tracing to skip logging a 412 error there. If doing so, that should be in a follow-up PR, but frankly, I don't see that much benefit in that, also since the plan is to abandon the device connection API for the command routing component concept.\n\nI am even more confused seeing that a few lines below we actually map the successful result to a 404?\n\nI've changed that now to 412.", "author": "calohmn", "createdAt":
