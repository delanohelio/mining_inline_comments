Rather than doing something much more custom, I went with the approach suggested by OWASP of \"Check if your framework has built-in CSRF protection & use it\".  So, in this PR, I'm letting Spring Security generate the CSRF token for us (it does so by generating a random UUID)\nWhile in this PR, the CSRF token does get stored in a Cookie, this is also the default behavior of Spring Security's CSRF Protection.\n\nBy default, Spring Security sends the CSRF token in a Cookie (named XSRF-TOKEN) to the client, and expects the token to be sent back both in the XSRF-TOKEN cookie and in a X-XSRF-TOKEN Http Header. So, by default, Spring security verifies the Cookie & Header match.  This is stateless, but it doesn't work cross-domain as the client won't be able to read the XSRF-TOKEN cookie in order to send it back in a header.\nMy approach is similarly stateless, but gets around the cross-domain issue by sending the CSRF token to the client both in a cookie (DSPACE-XSRF-COOKIE) and in an Http Header (DSPACE-XSRF-TOKEN).  This ensures that a client on a different domain can read the token from the Http Header and send it back in a different Http Header (X-XSRF-TOKEN).  Then, Spring Security can still do the same validation -- comparing the value in the cookie (in this case DSPACE-XSRF-COOKIE) to that in the X-XSRF-TOKEN header.", "author": "tdonohue", "createdAt": "2021-01-28T16:34:42Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU2NjEyODE5Ng=="}], "type": "inlineReview"}, {"oid": "70253bc1bf16ce6b612e5bbf3cc876407e05636a", "url": "https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/commit/70253bc1bf16ce6b612e5bbf3cc876407e05636a", "message": "Resolve feedback - Ensure DSpaceAccessDeniedHandler passes exception response handling to DSpaceApiExceptionControllerAdvice dynamically.", "committedDate": "2021-01-29T16:02:21Z", "type": "commit"}]}
