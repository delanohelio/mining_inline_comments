This logic is correct in most cases but may have\ntwo minor issues: (1) replicas are up but not in a required state for PUT. (2)\nreplica is actually down but failure detector temporarily marks it up after backoff.\nThis PR introduces 3rd criterion that ensures alive replicas are in eligible states\nfor PUT operation. Together with previous two criteria, the partition selection logic\nis able to preclude some unsatisfied partitions.", "committedDate": "2020-05-04T16:25:26Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyMTEyNzA3NQ==", "url": "https://github.com/linkedin/ambry/pull/1500#discussion_r421127075", "bodyText": "This is a nitpick.
