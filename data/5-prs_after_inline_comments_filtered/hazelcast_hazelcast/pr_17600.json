Since we don't set the new value, means we're not mutating the entry, which means it's read-only.\nNow that I think about it, it may be the case that some users use IMap.forEach to mutate the value. We have two options then:\n\u2022 we continue supporting only read-only use of forEach. This way, users mutating the values may get surprised but they can always switch to using regular EPs. Also, this way we don't introduce a massive overhead for read-only uses of forEach, meaning we don't create defensive copies, serialize after the lambda has been invoked, invoke entry listeners, WAN replication, etc. for every single value\n\u2022 we defensively act as if the value was mutated. That means both read-only and mutating lambdas will work correctly.\nBetween the two, I'd go with option 1. It's a bit surprising but users can always simply switch to a regular EP to mutate the values and we avoid the prohibitively expensive overhead of defensively copying, serializing, notifying listeners, etc. for read-only uses of forEach.\nIn other words, you can leave that one as-is.", "author": "mmedenjak", "createdAt": "2020-09-23T09:30:40Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5MzMzNzA4OA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5MzM3ODA1OQ==", "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/17600#discussion_r493378059", "bodyText": "Agree with you. forEach() is a bit subjective one!", "author": "webashutosh", "createdAt": "2020-09-23T09:40:20Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5MzMzNzA4OA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5Mzc4NTA3MA==", "url": "https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/17600#discussion_r493785070", "bodyText": "I guess there's also the marker interface of ReadOnly which can be added to the lambda but...
