If so, then keeping threadname at info level and stacktrace at debug somehow doesn't fit well IMHO.\nIf we know for certain that threadname is useful to get sufficient info, then we should not log stacktrace at all, and if stacktrace is required for debugging, then it should be at the same level as threadname.\n\nLevel debug is inconvenient since we have to re-run the user application to reproduce it.\n\nThis is exactly applicable to stacktrace also. If application is running with info level and if threadname is not sufficient to know the cause, then we can't get stacktrace either because our application was running with info level at that time and stacktrace is present at debug level in code. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af", "author": "virajjasani", "createdAt": "2020-08-15T16:34:54Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ3MDczNzc0Nw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ3MTAyODkyNw==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/hbase/pull/2219#discussion_r471028927", "bodyText": "For background, I left a longer comment awhile ago on HBASE-24686 where I asked for some indication of the close at info and the stack trace at debug.\nwe already have other things that get logged at INFO when a connection is closing, but it's incidental and could happen in other ways. so an INFO message that clearly demarcates connection close is a thing I really want from this change. Enough so that I am sure I'll be back requesting it again the very next time I run into a production problem where I don't see the message, because almost no one I support runs DEBUG in production as a matter of course. Most of the times where this log message would have helped me in the last ~6 months the thread name and an unambiguous \"we closed the connection\" would suffice.\nthe stack trace would help with a specific problem we hit in a dev set up with an apparent bug in the hmaster. It did not happen often but it did happen regularly, so changing the log level to DEBUG to see a stack trace would have worked fine for us.\nIf you feel strongly about not having the messages at different log levels, @virajjasani, I'd rather see both at INFO then both at DEBUG, even though I generally am against non-error related stack traces at log levels above DEBUG.", "author": "busbey", "createdAt": "2020-08-15T20:01:11Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ3MDczNzc0Nw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ3MTA3NTE0MQ==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/hbase/pull/2219#discussion_r471075141", "bodyText": "Most of the times where this log message would have helped me in the last ~6 months the thread name and an unambiguous \"we closed the connection\" would suffice.\n\nThat's perfectly fine, if thread name is enough for prod env and if we have a way to repro in dev env, we can let stacktrace be at debug.
