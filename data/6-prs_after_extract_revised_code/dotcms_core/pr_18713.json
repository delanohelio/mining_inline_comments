Since at this level I can still access the values of the secrets. If I attempt the same validation from an http client. The hidden values would have got through the serializer that changes hidden secrets by a string of asters so the final values would look like '*****' making it not possible to do the same type of validation.\nAnd.. would it be a bit redundant... Cuz I'm testing here the Resource per se. I don't think it makes sense to have the same test written twice.\nMaybe we should state what needs to be tested from postman and what needs to be tested from code.", "author": "fabrizzio-dotCMS", "createdAt": "2020-06-19T16:31:35Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0MjkzNzIwMQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0Mjk0OTM4MQ==", "url": "https://github.com/dotCMS/core/pull/18713#discussion_r442949381", "bodyText": "Sure makes sense.
