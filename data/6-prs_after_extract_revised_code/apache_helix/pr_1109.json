If we use native exists() and there is connection loss, it would not retry and instead go back to getChildren() again.\nThe potential issue could be the retry timeout, because new retryUntilConnected() has a new start time. So getState() would potentially retry longer than the configured retry timeout for getChildren().\nI don't have a strong preference. Seems you prefer native exits(), I'll change it.", "author": "huizhilu", "createdAt": "2020-07-03T06:14:14Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0NzMyMzMxNw=="}], "type": "inlineReview", "revised_code": {"commit": "cb3bcdce4c781b98fcdec5c0fbc2038900b610e1", "chunk": "diff --git a/zookeeper-api/src/main/java/org/apache/helix/zookeeper/zkclient/ZkClient.java b/zookeeper-api/src/main/java/org/apache/helix/zookeeper/zkclient/ZkClient.java\nindex 37e02eb53..020a267fe 100644\n--- a/zookeeper-api/src/main/java/org/apache/helix/zookeeper/zkclient/ZkClient.java\n+++ b/zookeeper-api/src/main/java/org/apache/helix/zookeeper/zkclient/ZkClient.java\n\n@@ -1007,23 +1007,22 @@ public class ZkClient implements Watcher {\n           try {\n             return getConnection().getChildren(path, watch);\n           } catch (ConnectionLossException e) {\n-            ++connectionLossRetryCount;\n+            // Issue: https://github.com/apache/helix/issues/962\n+            // Connection loss might be caused by an excessive number of children.\n+            // Infinitely retrying connecting may cause high GC in ZK server and kill ZK server.\n+            // This is a workaround to check numChildren to have a chance to exit retry loop.\n             // Allow retrying 3 times before checking stat checking number of children,\n             // because there is a higher possibility that connection loss is caused by other\n-            // factors such as network connectivity, connected ZK node could not serve\n-            // the request, session expired, etc.\n+            // factors such as network connectivity, session expired, etc.\n+            // TODO: remove this check once we have a better way to exit infinite retry\n+            ++connectionLossRetryCount;\n             if (connectionLossRetryCount >= 3) {\n-              // Issue: https://github.com/apache/helix/issues/962\n-              // Connection loss might be caused by an excessive number of children.\n-              // Infinitely retrying connecting may cause high GC in ZK server and kill ZK server.\n-              // This is a workaround to check numChildren to have a chance to exit retry loop.\n-              // TODO: remove this check once we have a better way to exit infinite retry\n-              Stat stat = getStat(path);\n+              Stat stat = ((ZkConnection) getConnection()).getZookeeper().exists(path, false);\n               if (stat != null) {\n                 if (stat.getNumChildren() > NUM_CHILDREN_LIMIT) {\n-                  LOG.error(\"Failed to get children for path {} because number of children {} \"\n-                          + \"exceeds limit {}, aborting retry.\", path, stat.getNumChildren(),\n-                      NUM_CHILDREN_LIMIT);\n+                  LOG.error(\"Failed to get children for path {} because of connection loss. \"\n+                          + \"Number of children {} exceeds limit {}, aborting retry.\", path,\n+                      stat.getNumChildren(), NUM_CHILDREN_LIMIT);\n                   // MarshallingErrorException could represent transport error: exceeding the\n                   // Jute buffer size.
