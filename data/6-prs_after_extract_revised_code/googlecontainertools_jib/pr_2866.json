But I think I was too naive. Previous I speculated that we don't have to worry about the argument length limit (#2733 (comment), #2471 (comment)). However, after searching \"argument list too long\" on the Internet today, I completely lost my previous confidence. Now I think the length limit is real and this change is not safe. For example: gradle/gradle#5754.\nSo it would be safer to have this as an opt-in feature. But that's really really unfortunate, because issues from a different library order are very cryptic and difficult to identify the cause. I really wish Java 8 supported the @-argument file feature.\nAnyways, if we do this, now I think we should have it as a config option (and additionally a system property). But the question as to whether we expand it by default or not remains.\nBut ideally, for Java 9+, I think we should really use the @-argument file feature; we can always preserve the classpath order while never hitting the system argument length limit. This is going to be a lot bigger change.\nIn sum, perhaps\n\nJava 9+: always use a @-argument file. (preserveClasspathOrder is irrelevant.)\nJava <=8: expand or not based on preserveClasspathOrder.
