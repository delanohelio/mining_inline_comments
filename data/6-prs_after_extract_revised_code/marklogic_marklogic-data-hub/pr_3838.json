Summary of changes:\n\n- Added new AbstractHubTest as a base class for HubTestBase and AbstractHubCentralTest. It has logic for resetting the project before a test runs, and for load project files. This is accomplished via the new \"testFixturesApi\" - \"java-test-fixture\" is a new feature in Gradle 5.6 for this exact use case, where test fixtures in core can be reused in the other DH projects. \n\n- LoadHubArtifactsCommand no longer has a \"force\" property to it; artifacts are always loaded. Modified it to ensure it never loads two documents with the same URI at the same time, which happens in some scenarios in our tests. \n\n- Modified LoadHubModuledCommand to default to a batch size of 10. In some scenarios when bootstrapping the test app, the config.sjs/config.xqy modules are being loaded twice, which causes a conflicting updates error. This prevents that. \n\n- The Installer program always install the test application.
