This is a good point Josh, generally, there is going to be a scalability issue on scanning through the entire \"autogenerated\" code and identifying these types of comments and calling them out in readme.\nWe already have tools to identify breaking changes but behaviors like this i.e. default server chosen value may not be detected by that tool. Maybe the one possible approach for \"autogenerated\" scenarios is, have the authors call out the important service behaviors in their swagger or swagger-readme and then that get picked by tools for the readme.", "author": "anuchandy", "createdAt": "2020-05-18T17:36:28Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyNjc2MTE4Mg=="}], "type": "inlineReview", "revised_code": null}]}
