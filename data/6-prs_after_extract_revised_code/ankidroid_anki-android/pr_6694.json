It appears substring only throws if endIndex is less than beginIndex so equal index values should work and empty string should be valid\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#substring(int,%20int)", "author": "mikehardy", "createdAt": "2020-07-18T15:24:14Z", "path": "AnkiDroid/src/main/java/com/ichi2/utils/StringUtil.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,40 @@\n+/*\n+ Copyright (c) 2020 David Allison <davidallisongithub@gmail.com>\n+\n+ This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under\n+ the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software\n+ Foundation; either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later\n+ version.\n+\n+ This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY\n+ WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A\n+ PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
