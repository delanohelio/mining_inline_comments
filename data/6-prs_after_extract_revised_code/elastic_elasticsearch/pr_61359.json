Needs to be more than tag size (16)\n\n    io.netty.handler.codec.DecoderException: javax.net.ssl.SSLException: Received close_notify during handshake\n\nWe typically only report unexpectedly-closed connections at `DEBUG`\nlevel, but these two messages don't follow that rule and generate a lot\nof noise as a result. This commit adjusts the logging to report these\ntwo exceptions at `DEBUG` level only.", "committedDate": "2020-08-20T08:20:50Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ3Mzc2MDkyMQ==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/61359#discussion_r473760921", "bodyText": "We were already checking for Received close_notify during handshake, just not within a DecoderException.
