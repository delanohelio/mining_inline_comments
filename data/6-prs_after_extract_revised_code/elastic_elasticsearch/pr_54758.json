In this case we\nforce always store aggregations in serialized form rather than a\ntraditional java reference. This should shrink the memory usage of large\naggregations at the cost of slightly slowing down aggregations where the\ncoordinating node is also a data node. Because we're only doing this\nwhen there are many shards this is likely to be fairly rare.\n\nAs a side effect this lets us add logs for the memory usage of the aggs\nbuffer:\n```\n[2020-04-03T17:03:57,052][TRACE][o.e.a.s.SearchPhaseController] [runTask-0] aggs partial reduction [1320->448] max [1320]\n[2020-04-03T17:03:57,089][TRACE][o.e.a.s.SearchPhaseController] [runTask-0] aggs partial reduction [1328->448] max [1328]\n[2020-04-03T17:03:57,102][TRACE][o.e.a.s.SearchPhaseController] [runTask-0] aggs partial reduction [1328->448] max [1328]\n[2020-04-03T17:03:57,103][TRACE][o.e.a.s.SearchPhaseController] [runTask-0] aggs partial reduction [1328->448] max [1328]\n[2020-04-03T17:03:57,105][TRACE][o.e.a.s.SearchPhaseController] [runTask-0] aggs final reduction [888] max [1328]\n```\n\nThese are useful, but you need to keep some things in mind before\ntrusting them:\n1. The buffers are oversized ala Lucene's ArrayUtils. This means that we\n   are using more space than we need, but probably not much more.\n2. Before they are merged the aggregations are inflated into their\n   traditional Java objects which *probably* take up a lot more space\n   than the serialized form. That is, after all, the reason why we store\n   them in serialized form in the first place.\n\nAnd, just because I can, here is another example of the log:\n```\n[2020-04-03T17:06:18,731][TRACE][o.e.a.s.SearchPhaseController] [runTask-0] aggs partial reduction [147528->49176] max [147528]\n[2020-04-03T17:06:18,750][TRACE][o.e.a.s.SearchPhaseController] [runTask-0] aggs partial reduction [147528->49176] max [147528]\n[2020-04-03T17:06:18,809][TRACE][o.e.a.s.SearchPhaseController] [runTask-0] aggs partial reduction [147528->49176] max [147528]\n[2020-04-03T17:06:18,827][TRACE][o.e.a.s.SearchPhaseController] [runTask-0] aggs partial reduction [147528->49176] max [147528]\n[2020-04-03T17:06:18,829][TRACE][o.e.a.s.SearchPhaseController] [runTask-0] aggs final reduction [98352] max [147528]\n```\n\nI got that last one by building a ten shard index with a million docs in\nit and running a `sum` in three layers of `terms` aggregations, all on\n`long` fields, and with a `batched_reduce_size` of `3`.", "committedDate": "2020-04-03T21:13:47Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "fbd62a096272821009c09fa2b43087807b0af321", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/commit/fbd62a096272821009c09fa2b43087807b0af321", "message": "Merge branch 'master' into agg_memory", "committedDate": "2020-04-03T21:48:17Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwMzM4Nzc0Mw==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/54758#discussion_r403387743", "bodyText": "I think I should add the task id to the output.
