This lead to a confusing situation where\nnumeric shard generations would be cached in `ShardGenerations`\nthat were not written to the repository because the repository\nor cluster did not yet support `ShardGenerations`.\nIn the case where shard generations are not actually supported yet,\nthese cached numeric generations are not safe and there's multiple\nscenarios where they would be incorrect, leading to the repository\ntrying to read shard level metadata from index-N that don't exist.\nThis commit makes it so that cached metadata is always in the same\nformat as the metadata in the repository.", "committedDate": "2020-06-07T09:19:51Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzNjM0NjYxOQ==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/57785#discussion_r436346619", "bodyText": "There is an obvious and much cleaner fix here by simply caching the compressed form of the already serialized RepositoryData when writing/reading instead of re-serializing that would also improve efficiency.
