The name compareAndRun also sounds good and to the point. The count parameter naturally should become the first parameter after the method name change to follow the convention of compareAndSet. Thanks!\nI decided to keep Runnable instead of changing it to CheckedRunnable. In fact, I started with CheckedRunnable, but I think it has a few disadvantages:\n\nIf we don't handle the exception of CheckedRunnable, the method would have a signature like:\npublic <E extends Exception> boolean compareAndRun(long count, CheckedRunnable<E> runnable) throws E\nIt forces its caller to handle exceptions even when the Runnable may not throw any exception (as in the NativePrivilegesStore case)\nIf we handle the exception inside the method and only bubble up RuntimeException, it will make the method easier to call because no exception handling is forced onto the caller. However, the method itself has no knowledge about he Runnable so it cannot perform meaningful handling other than maybe wrap it with a RuntimeException. It works, but makes it hard if the caller cares about the real exception and wants to handle it.\n\nMy understanding is that CheckedRunnable is better when possible exception types are limited and the method knows well how to handle (or ignore) them. Therefore, I prefer to just using Runnable. It works similar to above item 2, but giving caller full control of how exception should or should not be handled.", "author": "ywangd", "createdAt": "2021-02-05T01:48:46Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU2ODYyNDU3Nw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU3NjA3OTU5Mg==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/66310#discussion_r576079592", "bodyText": "Okay, sounds good to me.
