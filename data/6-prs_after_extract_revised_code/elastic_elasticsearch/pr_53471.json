I didn't want to add any more complexity to ModelLoadingService but adding this second use certainly does that. I thought I could split my usage out to a separate class but that then defeats the sharing the cache.\nRegarding the error case you describe at least it will error and the listener will be notified rather than silently timing out.\n\nThis is probably ok as long as it never is intended for production.\n\nLet's agree this feature branch will never be merged into master.
