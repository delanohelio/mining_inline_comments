The telemetry data is aggregate in nature, and unauthorized end-users will be unable to see these aggregates.  Since apm-* is a \"data index\" which users have complete control over, there's the risk that these indices contain documents that aren't created by the APM server for use within the APM application in Kibana, which could potentially lead to other bugs. I can only speculate on the likelihood and impact of these other bugs.\nI don't believe I was part of a prior discussion regarding .ml-anomalies*.

It seems to be wrong to be doing this via some internal implementation detail that could change (and could return an incorrect answer with the current implementation if somebody has created some other job not related to APM whose job ID ends with -high_mean_response_time).\nSince the APM telemetry code seems to know the job IDs of ML jobs APM might have created it would be better to just use the get job stats API.  That would mean giving the kibana_system role the manage_ml cluster privilege, but that's what we plan to do anyway for the \"ML in Spaces\" project so it wouldn't hurt if you did it now.  You could look for data_counts.processed_record_count > 0 in the job stats for the APM jobs to see if they've been used.\nEven if you really do want to report on ML indices (the internal implementation detail) rather than ML jobs (the public interface), I am not convinced it's appropriate to grant the read_cross_cluster privilege.

In this case, the imperative of obtaining user consent for metrics data loses importance.\nHowever, as you point out, users can potentially have write access to the apm-* indices, and code in Kibana might interpret that. Moreover, I assume the apm-* index pattern is user configurable, which would trip Kibana because reserved roles are not configurable.\nTherefore this sounds to me like a temporary solution. @dgieselaar would you agree with this assessment? I personally believe that we can come up with a better setup using capabilities from #52886 and #52886 , and I think we should have an GH issue in the elasticsearch or kibana repos that tracks this improvement and we should also add a link to it in a comment next to the apm-* privs.\nIf we follow the above, as well as @droberts195 's manage_ml suggestion, I would approve of this change.", "author": "albertzaharovits", "createdAt": "2020-03-17T20:18:51Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5MzcyNzE0Ng=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5Mzk0OTEyMQ==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/52917#discussion_r393949121", "bodyText": "@albertzaharovits I think we want to avoid requiring our users to initiate background tasks like this (IIUC this is necessary even with the linked PR) because we want a solution that works out of the box.

For example, using secondary authentication (see #52093 - I now realize I made a mistake in the above \"#52886 and #52886\") the query against the apm-* indices can be made by the end user currently interacting with the APM UI. Also, if changing the apm-* index pattern is at all possible, it should also be feasible to obtain an ES API key for the configured index pattern for the user doing the configuration (although I don't have any idea about the multi-tenancy aspect of the data in the apm indices).\nAnother point is that there is an apm_user system user already, and it's not clear to me why the same privileges have to be assigned to the kibana system user as well.\nUltimately it seems I lack the context, and the PR description does not provide it, so I feel I'm not the person to review the changes.
