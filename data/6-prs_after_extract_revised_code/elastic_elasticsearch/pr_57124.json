As explained\nin #51089, and due to FIPS 140 requirements, BouncyCastle FIPS\nprovider will block RSA keys that have been used for signing from\nbeing used for encryption and vice versa\n\nThis commit changes testNoAttributesReturnedWhenTheyCannotBeDecrypted\nto always use the specific keys we have added for encryption.", "committedDate": "2020-05-25T15:23:21Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQzMDE1Mjc1Mg==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/57124#discussion_r430152752", "bodyText": "I could use some help to understand what is going on here: Is this necessary because RSA_4096_updated is used in other tests as a signing key, e.g. in testSigningKeyIsReloadedForEachRequest?
