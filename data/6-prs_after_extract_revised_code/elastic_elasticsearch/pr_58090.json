The new thread pool should in fact help with resource stealing. Besides, saturation of GET thread pool has wider negative impacts to both uncached and cached authentication. A new pool helps isolate the impact to only new clients trying to connect.\nBalance between throughput and resource contention - the expensive hashing operations are unavoidable. Performance tests show about 5000 authentications per minute (8 cores). With half of the threads, the number will be halved as well. Assuming a 25K clients (50K keys) use case, it will take 20 min for all keys to be cached. Reducing the number of threads too much would push the warm up time even higher. Therefore using half number of the cores feels like a reasonable middle ground.\nHashing in the generic thread pool (which uses all cores) does not have obvious performance hit - I tried simply pushing the hashing to the generic thread pool, which then used all cores for the hashing. I didn't observe any obivious performance issue with it. In fact, the initial warm up stage is smoother and has a better throughput than using the GET thread pool. Therefore it feels that using half of the cores should be relatively safe and also performant. I do plan to run a few more rounds of performance tests after all scheduled v7.9 API key improvements. So we can be confident on this.\nThe new thread pool will be shared by all security related expensive operations - currently its only usage is for hashing of API key auth, so it is not a very good reason. But it could soon see another use case: the API key creation also requires expensive hashing which currently runs in the transport_worker thread.

The original peak rate (using the get pool) was noisy because any get requests in the system interfered with it (in addition to the obvious flip side that authn hashing interfered with get requests in the system).\nWhen the system is busy and all threads are working at the pool queues and no queue is empty, it all boils down to the processors' queue. In a sense all thread pool queues \"merge\" into processor queues, with the priority given by the relative number of threads ascribed to each pool. So introducing a new pool will decrease the throughput of existing pools, proportionate to relative sizes, in exchange of a guaranteed minimum throughput on the new pool ,because the new queue is not populated with any other types of work (compared to reusing an existing pool that contains other work types).\nTo summarise, I would generally introduce a thread pool when I want more control over the rate of some work (both the minimum and the maximum rate).\nThat's my thought process about thread pool queues upon which I've approved the PR.

Given their expensiveness and importance, we'd like to control their impact both ways: they should not take over all system resources but in the mean time should maintain a reasonable level of throughput. We use following criteria to justify whether an operation should be added to this pool:\n\nIs it expensive? The standard here is somewhat subjective. Based on performance tests, I personally would eye on anything longer than 1 ms.\nIs it authentication/authorization related? We'd like to prioritize these operations since they usually need to complete in a timely manner.\nDoes it need to scale? i.e. potential burst in volume? When there is a large increase in concurrency, we'd like to protect the system from being completely flooded.\n\nWith above criteria, we can come up with the followings:\n\nHashing for uncached results are great candidates. These include API Key auth (current PR, v7.9), API Key creation (v7.9?), tokens, username/password (planned, v7.10)\nSigning and cryption for SAML assertions and odic claims are potential candidates (pending further performance check)\nHashing for cached result is not qualified for the new thread pool since it is fast (sha256, ~3 microseconds).\nManipulations of security documents are not qualified either\nEncrypted snapshot, though potentially expensive, is not auth related and unlikely needs to scale. Hence it is also not qualified.\nAn interesting case is read/write of the security index. When the index is not on the local node, these operations can be expensive (above 1 ms) and it also matches the two other criteria. However the system indices work (#57936) is supposed to cover it. Hence we are not considering it either.\nAny other security aspects that are not qualified\n\nNow the question is: whether above unqualified security operations worth to have their own separate thread pool?\nWhen security is enabled, security related operations are ubiquitous, e.g. every request needs to go through authentication and authorization flow. Currently our general practice is to \"just let them run in the same thread\", which could be get, transport_worker etc. This strategy has served us reasonally well so far. But with the upcoming change to expose the service to unprecedented large number of clients, we started noticing some issues revealed by the performance tests, which in turn leads to this PR and a few other work in the pipeline. At this stage, based on what we know, we still believe the existing strategy works fine for security operations that are not qualified for the new thread pool. Hence we do not plan to add another one.\nFor the sake of completeness, there are exceptions to the existing strategy. Outbound LDAP calls are submitted via the generic pool to avoid risks of deadlocking if they are submitted via the same pool used by the outbound requests. There is no sign for this being an issue so far. We had brief discussion about it and decided to evaluate it more closely at a later time.", "author": "ywangd", "createdAt": "2020-07-02T14:01:11Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0MTM0ODYxOA=="}], "type": "inlineReview", "revised_code": {"commit": "57ec11fea59945c7cc5f150578a3a7bb55a1d2ce", "chunk": "diff --git a/x-pack/plugin/security/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/xpack/security/Security.java b/x-pack/plugin/security/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/xpack/security/Security.java\nindex d848303e1f9..221e96f8190 100644\n--- a/x-pack/plugin/security/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/xpack/security/Security.java\n+++ b/x-pack/plugin/security/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/xpack/security/Security.java\n\n@@ -997,7 +999,7 @@ public class Security extends Plugin implements SystemIndexPlugin, IngestPlugin,\n             return List.of(\n                 new FixedExecutorBuilder(settings, TokenService.THREAD_POOL_NAME, 1, 1000,\n                     \"xpack.security.authc.token.thread_pool\", false),\n-                new FixedExecutorBuilder(settings, ApiKeyService.THREAD_POOL_NAME,\n+                new FixedExecutorBuilder(settings, SECURITY_CRYPTO_THREAD_POOL_NAME,\n                     (allocatedProcessors + 1) / 2, 1000,\n                     \"xpack.security.authc.api_key.thread_pool\", false)\n             );\n"}}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0MjE4NTA0Ng==", "url": "https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/58090#discussion_r442185046", "bodyText": "This is not how the EsThreadPoolExecutor handles over-capacity.
