I wasn't raised functional fundamentalist. I still prefer ifPresent() when chained after methods that return Optional though. It's a nice counterpart to orElseThrow(), orElseGet(), and orElse(), all of which come at the end of the chain.\nOf your two options I like the first one better. One thing to note (likely inconsequential here) is that in your scheme you call putAll regardless of whether you need to or not.
