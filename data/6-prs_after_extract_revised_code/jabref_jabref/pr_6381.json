I have the LinkedFileViewModel that I use for the download, but I cannot add it to any LinkedFilesEditorViewModel to be displayed.\nOne quick fix I could think of would be to keep the online-link even for right-click->download actions or delete the link for both methods. There would still be no progress bar for the imported files, but at least it stops duplication.\nThe best fix (IMO) would be to gain somehow access to the actual LinkedFileViewModel of the online link after the import and call download from there, basically imitating a user right-clicking the item and selecting download.

I like how the right-click -> download action puts a small progress bar in the file entry itself. I can work with the bib entry, and if I try to open up the file, I see the progress bar.\nHowever, since there is no access to the linked files editor from the importer, I cannot add the progress bar there. I think moving the download-related properties to LinkedFile would work quite well; I just don't know if it is compliant with how JabRef is developed.\nOne more thought on that addLinkedFileFromURL method you mentioned. It seems to share a lot of code with the download method of LinkedFileViewModel. If we move the properties I was talking about to the LinkedFile class; the LinkedFilesEditorViewModel would always correctly display the progress no matter where the download() method of LinkedFileViewModel would be called from.

From an outsiders view though it seems logical to me to place the download-progress properties in the linked files. As I see it, they are more related to the status of the actual file than with the UI action and therefore belong with the model. Just my thoughts though and since it does not fix anything I don't really care at all.\n\nYou said you don't like to use the dialogue to show the progress. Why is this?\n\nIt just seems disruptive to me. If I had to choose between waiting in the import dialogue and having no progress bar, I would definitely choose the second option.

The file would be corrupt but still there and the user might link it manually the next time as it already has the correct name and JabRef would pick it up easily. This could be a problem.\n\nuser removes online link before they are downloaded, etc\n\nI think this would be fine. The download would still go on and when it's done the new entry is added (as my code does not overwrite the online-link entry but add a new one). If one would then close JabRef during the download, the next time there would be neither an online-link nor a file entry, which I guess would be fine as the user explicitly deleted the link.\nI noticed in the code (never while running JabRef and I cannot find any piece of code where it is actually used and even setting it's visibility to true does not show anything, maybe it's just dead code) that there is a progress bar in the right end of the status line at the bottom of the frame. What about using that one? The user is not disrupted in his flow and upon closing, we could pop a dialogue warning about ongoing downloads.\nIf that progress bar is dead code, I guess there was one at some point which was then removed, so you probably didn't like it. In that case, what do you think about having a small loading circle or a download icon in the top right, next to the menu bar? It could be turning/greyed out while downloading and a tooltip could display the progress of single files.", "author": "btut", "createdAt": "2020-05-06T05:45:57Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQxOTU0NDUwOA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyMDkzNTU0Ng==", "url": "https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/6381#discussion_r420935546", "bodyText": "Ok, you convinced me, let's continue trying to do it in the background.

One possibility to implement this would be adding an ObservableList of open tasks (including their progress) in StatusManager.\n\nThat was the basic idea. BackgroundTask already has a workDonePercentageProperty, so all thats left to do is build a list of them and display it.\nI have a couple of questions though:\n\n\nThe list of tasks would consist of a text label and a progress bar. BackgroundTask has a StringProperty message, I would use that one for the label. Unfortunately, the message does not seem to be set by the file downloaders. It is only set by the UnlinkedFilesCrawler. Did I miss something? If not, I would add a message (something like \"Downloading file from \"). For other tasks that use BackgroundTask we could either add a message parameter to the Background-Task constructor to force users to provide a sensible message, or we could set the default message to \" in progress\", so at the very least it says \"BackgroundTask\" in progress, for child-classes it would take the child's name and produce a somewhat usable label.\n\n\nI can't seem to find the fxml file for the main JabRef frame where I would add the status wheel.

I already started drafting some code and came by the properties and did some reading.\nI implemented a simple dialog using the TaskProgressView from javafx control. That looks pretty nice IMO. Unfortunately (and quite obviously) it works on a list of javafx tasks, not JabRef BackgroundTasks.\nI noticed that BackgroundTasks are converted to javafx tasks anyways, so when that is done I enlist them in an ObservableList I created in StateManager. The tasks show up, but the bindings do not seem to work, I still have to figure out why. So right now, one can see a list of tasks, but the tasks have no title, no message and an infinite progress bar.\nIf you don't mind I would like to open a WIP PR and if I need some help I would start a discussion there.
