That contributes to the handshake handling in LocalBitcoinNode\nbeing a bit complicated.\n\nRefactoring consists of two principle changes: the public interface is\nsplit into methods that trigger checks and methods that retrieve the\ncached results. The methods that trigger checks have names starting\nwith \"check\", and methods that retrieve the cached results have names\nthat start with \"is\".\n\nThe other major refactor is the use of Optional<Boolean> instead of\nboolean for storing and returning the results, an empty Optional\nsignifying that the relevant check was not yet performed. Switching to\nOptionals has caused other code that queries LocalBitcoinNode to throw\nan exception in case the query is made before the checks are. Before,\nthe results were instantiated to \"false\" and that would be returned\nin case the query was made before the checks completed. This change has\nrevealed one occasion (Preferences class) where this happens.", "committedDate": "2020-02-17T22:34:58Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4MDM5MTYwMQ==", "url": "https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/3982#discussion_r380391601", "bodyText": "Removed redundant LocalBitcoinNode call, because Preferences.getUseTorForBitcoinJ makes the same call and it has the same effect.", "author": "dmos62", "createdAt": "2020-02-17T22:58:53Z", "path": "core/src/main/java/bisq/core/app/BisqSetup.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -559,7 +576,7 @@ else if (displayTorNetworkSettingsHandler != null)\n \n         // We only init wallet service here if not using Tor for bitcoinj.\n         // When using Tor, wallet init must be deferred until Tor is ready.\n-        if (!preferences.getUseTorForBitcoinJ() || localBitcoinNode.isDetected()) {", "originalCommit": "f895da416fbe4c75acdaebe9f9f22e534edf09d1", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4NDM2OTA5MA==", "url": "https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/3982#discussion_r384369090", "bodyText": "If localBitcoinNode.willUse() == true and config.useTorForBtcOptionSetExplicitly == true the new code will behave differently than before.
