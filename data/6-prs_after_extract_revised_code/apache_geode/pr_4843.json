With openjdk 8, it only sets SNI hostname if there is a\ndot in the hostname. See sun.security.ssl.Utilities#addToSNIServerNameList\n\nFor this reason, we need to only set the SNI hostname if the JDK did not.\nOtherwise it will complain that there is a `Duplicated server name of type 0`", "committedDate": "2020-03-23T22:43:11Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5NzI4OTc1OQ==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/4843#discussion_r397289759", "bodyText": "Two things:\n\na nit: the allocation can be moved after the conditional :)\nis the type check sufficient or is a content check necessary?\n\non (2) I wonder if there is a scenario where SNI might be set already, but maybe it disagrees with addr.getHostName()", "author": "Bill", "createdAt": "2020-03-24T16:27:23Z", "path": "geode-core/src/main/java/org/apache/geode/internal/net/SocketCreator.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -774,6 +775,14 @@ private void setServerNames(SSLParameters modifiedParams, HostAndPort addr) {\n     List<SNIServerName> oldNames = modifiedParams.getServerNames();\n     oldNames = oldNames == null ?
