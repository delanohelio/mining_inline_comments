On the same\nDomination 1914 all-AI round, UnitsHitsChange.perform() now only\ntakes 200 ms (instead of 254 sec).", "committedDate": "2020-04-18T13:25:54Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQxMDczNDAzOA==", "url": "https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/pull/6289#discussion_r410734038", "bodyText": "Is this disjoint check just not needed in the end?", "author": "DanVanAtta", "createdAt": "2020-04-18T18:36:22Z", "path": "game-core/src/main/java/games/strategy/engine/data/UnitHitsChange.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -10,35 +9,42 @@\n \n   private final IntegerMap<Unit> hits;\n   private final IntegerMap<Unit> undoHits;\n+  private final Collection<Territory> territoriesToNotify;\n \n-  private UnitHitsChange(final IntegerMap<Unit> hits, final IntegerMap<Unit> undoHits) {\n+  private UnitHitsChange(\n+      final IntegerMap<Unit> hits,\n+      final IntegerMap<Unit> undoHits,\n+      final Collection<Territory> territoriesToNotify) {\n     this.hits = hits;\n     this.undoHits = undoHits;\n+    this.territoriesToNotify = territoriesToNotify;\n   }\n \n-  public UnitHitsChange(final IntegerMap<Unit> hits) {\n-    this.hits = new IntegerMap<>(hits);\n-    undoHits = new IntegerMap<>();\n-    for (final Unit item : this.hits.keySet()) {\n+  public UnitHitsChange(\n+      final IntegerMap<Unit> hits, final Collection<Territory> territoriesToNotify) {\n+    this(new IntegerMap<>(hits), undoHits(hits), territoriesToNotify);\n+  }\n+\n+  private static IntegerMap<Unit> undoHits(final IntegerMap<Unit> hits) {\n+    final var undoHits = new IntegerMap<Unit>();\n+    for (final Unit item : hits.keySet()) {\n       undoHits.put(item, item.getHits());\n     }\n+    return undoHits;\n   }\n \n   @Override\n   protected void perform(final GameData data) {\n     for (final Unit item : hits.keySet()) {\n       item.setHits(hits.getInt(item));\n     }\n-    final Set<Unit> units = hits.keySet();\n-    for (final Territory element : data.getMap().getTerritories()) {\n-      if (!Collections.disjoint(element.getUnits(), units)) {", "originalCommit": "0dc31a1f1cba2accd269510d79987b3a7cabf722", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQxMDc0NjE1OQ==", "url": "https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/pull/6289#discussion_r410746159", "bodyText": "That's right.
