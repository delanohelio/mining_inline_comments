If it is mis-replicated it will report that. If it is both, it reports them both separately, along with their \"missing count\" for each. In HDFS for racks, there can only ever be 1 additional rack needed. But with upgrade domain, there can be possibly two additional domains needed.\n\nI see this as something that still implicitly brings in rack awareness into ReplicationManager via an arbitrary int value\n\nIt brings mis-replication into the RM, not rack awareness, and this is OK. A container needs to meet several goals to be properly replicated - the correct number of healthy replicas and the correct placement and this is what the replication manager checks.\nIn Recon, we want to be able to give an indicator about mis-replication and under replication separately in a similar way and ideally with Recon we just load the exact same placement policy as the cluster is using and call the same methods.\n\nI am unhappy about the check in lines from L562, and suggested a way there if we can achieve it.\n\nThis check is still useful. If we combined the two rules as you are suggesting so \"addtitionalReplicaRequired\" return a single number representing delta and misRep, then in the case where you have delta=1, misRep=1 (ie two replicas on one rack), then if the newly selected node, due to fallback, gives us 3 replicas on one rack. This is OK, but the next time this container is checked, we have 3 replicas on one rack, and the logic will return 1, telling us to create another. We need to be sure this improves the mis-replication before creating a 4th replica, as that will make the container over-replicated.\nOf course, we can check:\n\nIf we test 2 replicas with 1 rack, the logic will return 1.\nIf we test 3 replicas with 1 rack, the logic will return 1.\nIf we test 4 replicas with 1 rack, the logic will return 1.\n\nSo if we push the under and mis-replication numbers together, we cannot really see what is going on, and we will need to test the replication count too I think anyway.\nI can give these methods new names or improve the java docs a bit more to make it clear that placement != replication and the number returned from the ContainerPlacementStatus object does not reflect replicas. I've made a small change to the doc now and will push it up:\n  /**\n   * Returns a boolean indicating if the container replicas meet the desired\n   * placement policy. That is, they are placed on a sufficient number of\n   * racks, or node groups etc. This does not check if the container is over\n   * or under replicated, as it is possible for a container to have enough\n   * replicas and still not meet the placement rules.\n   * @return True if the containers meet the policy.

There is a fallback (certainly in the pipeline placement policy, but I have not checked the ContainerPlacementRackAware in complete detail) where if the placement policy cannot select enough racks, it will give back nodes which do not meet the placement.\nThis is to ensure (in the case of pipelinePlacementPolicy) that the cluster can keep on operating if only 1 rack is available for some reason. For the closed container placement, this should be the case too, as if you are down to 1 replica, it is better it gets replicated onto more nodes on the same rack, rather than risk losing the data.\nWe probably need a future change to scrub the bad pipelines if this fall back happens, while replication manager should deal with closed containers.", "author": "sodonnel", "createdAt": "2020-05-05T15:33:50Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyMDA3MTIxMQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyMDUxMjk3Nw==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/ozone/pull/881#discussion_r420512977", "bodyText": "Right, I see your point... I am not sure, haven't checked, but I guess based on NetworkTopology, and maybe NodeManager we can tell how many healthy racks we have, and if we have one, and the fallback is enabled, then we can report the number of required replicas to be zero in the case we got down to 1 live rack only, while if fallback is not enabled, then we should report 1 additional replica to be required, and give a warning in the logs as the policy can not be met.\nI think it would be more clear to handle that in the validation of rack aware policies if we can. What do you think?\nNote that we are hardcoding fallback = true at the moment at the only place where we call the policy factory in non-test code.", "author": "fapifta", "createdAt": "2020-05-06T02:26:06Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyMDA3MTIxMQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyMDY5MTM0Mw==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/ozone/pull/881#discussion_r420691343", "bodyText": "The nodemanager + topology can easily tell us the total racks every registered since SCM was started. But if you have a case where the cluster had 2 racks and than a rack has stopped, that is not so easy to see. You would need to filter all the non-healthy nodes, which is basically what the placement policy does. Then it falls back to give you a non-placement valid node if it needs to. It is important it does this, as it needs to handle under-replication too via the same chooseNodes methods.\nThe whole area around the fallback needs further thought in general. If we fall to 1 rack, on a cluster that had 2 racks, then its safe to assume the other rack should come back, and until it does the containers are mis-replicated (and probably under-replicated too) and should be reported as such.\nIn both cases a warning would be written to the logs stating:\nLOG.warn(\"Container {} is mis-replicated, requiring {} additional \" +\n              \"replicas. After selecting new nodes, mis-replication has not \" +\n              \"improved. No additional replicas will be scheduled\",\n              id, misRepDelta);\n\nThis is really an edge case (2 rack cluster going into 1 rack) and I think we should leave this as it is for now as there are surely other things need to be thought about here in the wider network topology logic.", "author": "sodonnel", "createdAt": "2020-05-06T10:32:17Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyMDA3MTIxMQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyMDc3NTY1NQ==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/ozone/pull/881#discussion_r420775655", "bodyText": "Ok, let's do so for now, but if we can, try to keep this in mind as a possible improvement, as the current check feels a bit hacky still :)", "author": "fapifta", "createdAt": "2020-05-06T13:08:29Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyMDA3MTIxMQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyMDg0NjY5Mg==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/ozone/pull/881#discussion_r420846692", "bodyText": "Yea, there are improvements needed in this area for sure.
