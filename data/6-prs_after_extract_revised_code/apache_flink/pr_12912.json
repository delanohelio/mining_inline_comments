While the Canceler thread calling ch1#releaseAllResources, it will occupy the bufferQueue lock and try to call ch2#notifyBufferAvailable.\n2. While task thread exiting to call CachedBufferStorage#close, it might release exclusive buffers for ch2. Then ch2 will occupy the bufferQueue\nlock and try to call ch1#notifyBufferAvailable.\n3. ch1 and ch2 will both occupy self bufferQueue lock and wait for other side's bufferQueue lock to cause deadlock.\n\nRegarding the solution, we can check the released state outside of bufferQueue lock in RemoteInputChannel#notifyBufferAvailable to return immediately.", "committedDate": "2020-07-16T09:56:22Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ1NjQ4OTA2Nw==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/12912#discussion_r456489067", "bodyText": "Before the change, if channel isReleased then we also set isWaitingForFloatingBuffers to false below.\nI'm not sure that leaving it as true would be correct.\nWDYT?", "author": "rkhachatryan", "createdAt": "2020-07-17T14:46:39Z", "path": "flink-runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/runtime/io/network/partition/consumer/RemoteInputChannel.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -356,6 +356,13 @@ public Buffer getNextReceivedBuffer() {\n \t@Override\n \tpublic NotificationResult notifyBufferAvailable(Buffer buffer) {\n \t\tNotificationResult notificationResult = NotificationResult.BUFFER_NOT_USED;\n+\t\t// Two remote channels might call this method mutually by task thread and canceller thread concurrently.\n+\t\t// To avoid deadlock issue we can check the released state to return immediately before synchronizing.\n+\t\t// See FLINK-18595 for details.\n+\t\tif (isReleased.get()) {\n+\t\t\treturn notificationResult;", "originalCommit": "356e5646f79c864a283b0a1f58fdd8339932fd68", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ1NzAxMzc3Mg==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/12912#discussion_r457013772", "bodyText": "Before the change, if the channel was already released while calling notifyBufferAvailable, it will exit directly by the following:\nif (isReleased.get() || bufferQueue.getAvailableBufferSize() >= numRequiredBuffers) {\n\tisWaitingForFloatingBuffers = false;\n\treturn notificationResult;\n}\n\nSo we will not leave it as true finally.\nAnother option is to explicitly reset this state as false in #releaseAllResources, but it would also bring some additional check while checking the isWaitingForFloatingBuffers state to avoid misleading exception.

Otherwise the channel is not waiting for floating buffers, but it is still keeping as listener inside LocalBufferPool to bring conflict.
