This resulted in exceptions being raised when individual nodes\nwere not responding and node discovery was not used. This was e.g. being\nnoticable when performing searches and 1 of 3 nodes was failing, so\nevery 3rd search request was timing out and returning an error instead\nof being retried and successful and just taking longer.\n\nThis change is adding this class to the exceptions being retried, so any\nrequest that goes out to a node which is not responding on time is\nretried.", "committedDate": "2020-12-29T12:48:16Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU2MTk4OTk3Nw==", "url": "https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog2-server/pull/9852#discussion_r561989977", "bodyText": "Duplicate license that needs to be removed.", "author": "bernd", "createdAt": "2021-01-21T15:51:25Z", "path": "graylog-storage-elasticsearch6/src/test/java/org/graylog/storage/elasticsearch6/jest/GraylogJestRetryHandlerTest.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,57 @@\n+/*\n+ * Copyright (C) 2020 Graylog, Inc.\n+ *\n+ * This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n+ * it under the terms of the Server Side Public License, version 1,\n+ * as published by MongoDB, Inc.\n+ *\n+ * This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n+ * but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n+ * MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
