We will allow opening connections paralelly from\n`doConnectToCandidateCluster` path. As soon as a response returned from the\nserver(with uuid), we check if a connection is already there and close\nthe new connection before putting it in `activeConnection`.\n\nPeriodic `ConnectToAllClusterMembersTask` will not try to connect\nan already connected member.And it will use `uuid` to decide that.\n\n2. This two paths will not use same method `getOrConnect` to simplify\nthe logic. One will based on address and the other only uuid to\nmake the intent clear.\n\nTest:\nI could not write a unit test because this requires an inaccessible\nprivate network behind a public address.", "committedDate": "2020-11-24T13:16:43Z", "type": "forcePushed"}]}
