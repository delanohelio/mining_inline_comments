During relocation both this class and {@code LoggerFactory} are moved to the\n+ * the {@code com.hazelcast} package. As a result the relocated factory finds the relocated binder and no warning is produced.\n+ * <p>\n+ * At the same time, the normal SLF4J dependency still looks for the binder at the usual location, and therefore other runtime\n+ * classes that use SLF4J are not affected.
