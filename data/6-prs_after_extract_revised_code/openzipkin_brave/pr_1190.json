The most\n+ * common usage is assigning {@linkplain BaggageField baggage} parsed from the request to a span.\n+ * However, this supports other use cases such as extended trace contexts and secondary sampling.\n+ *\n+ * <h3>Method overview</h3>\n+ * {@link #decorate(TraceContext)} ensures that the resulting {@link TraceContext} has an instance\n+ * of \"extra\" ({@link #<E>}), that it is associated only with the context's span ID, and that fields\n+ * inside \"extra\" considers upstream values, such as from a parent span.\n+ *\n+ * <p>{@link #create()} is used to add an instance of {@link #<E>} to an {@link\n+ * TraceContextOrSamplingFlags extraction result}. Concretely, this allows additional request data,\n+ * such as a request ID, to be inherited from a request, and possibly changed, before a trace\n+ * context is {@linkplain #decorate(TraceContext) decorated}.\n+ *\n+ * <h3>Integration</h3>\n+ * The only valid way to integrate this is via a custom {@link Propagation.Factory}. Its {@link\n+ * Propagation.Factory#decorate(TraceContext)} method MUST dispatch to {@link\n+ * #decorate(TraceContext)}.\n+ *\n+ * <p>If request state is needed, {@link Propagation#extractor(Propagation.Getter)}\n+ * MUST call {@link #create()} only once per request. The result should be added to\n+ * TraceContextOrSamplingFlags.Builder#addExtra(Object)}.\n+ *\n+ * <h3>Notes</h3>\n+ * <p>The reason {@link #create()} is decoupled from {@link #decorate(TraceContext)} is because\n+ * extra data can exist in a request even if a trace context does not. Even when a trace context\n+ * exists in headers, it is only used directly when {@linkplain Tracing.Builder#supportsJoin(boolean)\n+ * join is supported}. In other words, {@link #<E>} carries any data from the request until it can\n+ * be associated with a {@link TraceContext} (via {@link #decorate(TraceContext)}.\n+ *\n+ * <p>It may not be intuitive why implementations should always add\n+ *\n+ * <p>If your data is not mutable, and is constant through the trace, do not use this. Instead, add\n+ * your own type via {@link TraceContextOrSamplingFlags.Builder#addExtra(Object)} as the tracer will\n+ * copy it down to children by default.\n+ *\n+ * <p>Even though {@link #<E>} is mutable, it must be copy-on-write internally. This type manages\n+ * state forking that ensures that updates to child spans are invisible to their parents or\n+ * siblings.\n+ *\n+ * @param <E> They type of {@link Extra} managed by this factory. Must be a final class. The type is\n+ * typically package private to avoid accidental interference.\n+ * @param <F> An instance of this factory. {@link #<E>} should be associated with only one factory.\n+ */\n+public abstract class ExtraFactory<E extends Extra<E, F>, F extends ExtraFactory<E, F>> {", "originalCommit": "bd22f664c4a8937a9c59d1a750d4a559cd40d1b7", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview", "revised_code": null}, {"oid": "62c89fd3093487a2b5cbbfac8906fb99bccdff74", "url": "https://github.com/openzipkin/brave/commit/62c89fd3093487a2b5cbbfac8906fb99bccdff74", "message": "fuzz", "committedDate": "2020-05-06T03:45:10Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "6d7b07d90c95cf160c0c3d173592f63eee2fbea7", "url": "https://github.com/openzipkin/brave/commit/6d7b07d90c95cf160c0c3d173592f63eee2fbea7", "message": "Merge branch 'master' into back-to-factory", "committedDate": "2020-05-06T05:23:27Z", "type": "commit"}]}
