This exception is also thrown at least to xroad-proxy, signer-cli, and in theory could by unwanted in those. It is just a text change so the probability of it breaking things should be minimal, though.\nMaybe we should add a way to define core error messages (or overrides to default messages) inside proxy-ui-api module.\nLet's work on this if we get more of these UI-rooted needs to change error messages. Now next release is quite soon, there's no sense in opening this issue more at this point.", "author": "jansu76", "createdAt": "2020-11-25T13:27:40Z", "path": "src/signer/src/main/java/ee/ria/xroad/signer/protocol/handler/GetMemberSigningInfoRequestHandler.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -68,7 +68,8 @@ protected Object handle(GetMemberSigningInfo message) throws Exception {\n \n         if (memberKeys.isEmpty()) {\n             throw CodedException.tr(X_UNKNOWN_MEMBER, \"member_certs_not_found\",\n-                    \"Could not find any certificates for member '%s'\", message.getMemberId());\n+                    \"Could not find any certificates for member '%s'. \"\n+                        + \"Are you sure tokens containing the certifications are logged in?\", message.getMemberId());", "originalCommit": "035c6753a846bb6d75bd44d4c1d078b7dc8795e8", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": null, "type": "inlineReview", "revised_code": null}]}
