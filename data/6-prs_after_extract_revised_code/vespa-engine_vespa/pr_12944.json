No, because changing the flag wouldn't bump the config version and wouldn't trigger a new fetch, and possibly leaving half of the nodes with one view of the flags and the other half with another view.\nOne possibility is to freeze the flag values (fork the flag source), and pass that through to the config model. Another faster time-to-market would be to have a special value (say a String) which is specially handled in the config model (split on \";\" in to a set of hostnames).", "author": "hakonhall", "createdAt": "2020-04-16T12:03:37Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwOTQ2OTA2NQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwOTc4MzcxNw==", "url": "https://github.com/vespa-engine/vespa/pull/12944#discussion_r409783717", "bodyText": "OK, then the host dimension needs another solution.", "author": "baldersheim", "createdAt": "2020-04-16T19:03:16Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQwOTQ2OTA2NQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview", "revised_code": null}, {"oid": "e0b93a22f5f09e6b939eab50e3ff138ef15fbd42", "url": "https://github.com/vespa-engine/vespa/commit/e0b93a22f5f09e6b939eab50e3ff138ef15fbd42", "message": "Document that it is per zone too.", "committedDate": "2020-04-16T12:54:39Z", "type": "commit"}]}
