As I'd like anyone building locally to also catch bugs before we enable features in STABLE.\nThe uses should be restricted to enabling certain experimental features by default instead of disabling them. Given that, maybe make this private and only in the FlutterSettings class to avoid misuse. It would be good to avoid uses of it that make it harder to test behavior in the release version by having dev/SNAPSHOT diverge.", "author": "jacob314", "createdAt": "2020-09-02T15:34:44Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4MTQ4ODM3OA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4MjE5OTI2NQ==", "url": "https://github.com/flutter/flutter-intellij/pull/4790#discussion_r482199265", "bodyText": "Okay, that makes sense - updated here: #4794", "author": "helin24", "createdAt": "2020-09-02T16:21:45Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ4MTQ4ODM3OA=="}], "type": "inlineReview", "revised_code": null}]}
