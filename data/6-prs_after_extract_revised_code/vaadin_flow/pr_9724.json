It's hard to understand when trace should be used instead of info(and vice versa).\nI may use info here  instead of trace.\nBut I've decided to use trace  here because one small observation : every place where info level (or more severe) is used is not standard situation: either new pnpm  is installed or some specific directory (home dir) is used for pnpm executable.\nAnd I see this information as something that I may be interested in.\nIf global pnpm (or pnpm explicitly installed in the project dir) is used then this has been done explicitly by the user (global installation and pnpm installed inside the project dir has to be made manually). And then log info about this is something extra because there was an explicit action to install. So this is something known: I'm not interested in it.", "author": "denis-anisimov", "createdAt": "2020-12-28T06:45:10Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDU0OTIyODE3Ng=="}], "type": "inlineReview", "revised_code": null}]}
