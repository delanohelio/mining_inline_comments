Have we tested this on Chrome, Firefox and Safari? Any idea if this referer header for SW initiated requests is part of some spec?\nI also started wondering does the user need to download the index page twice now on first load (first normally with the token and then SW would load and precache it without the token)? If so it would be good if we can somehow avoid the double load but that could be a new issue.\nOtherwise the code seems good to me.
