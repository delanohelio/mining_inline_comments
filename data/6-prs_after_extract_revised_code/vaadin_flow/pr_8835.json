I agree, this does look strange. This is just a test fixture code, it does not matter much which of supported annotations are listed here.\nLet me kindly a related question though, because I think I have a use case for this strange combination. Consider below:\nclass MySelection {\n  long id;\n  // ...\n}\n\nclass MyForm {\n  // @Nullable?\n  @NotNull\n  MySelection selection; \n}\nWe generate TypeScript definitions corresponding to the Java beans above. When doing that, we assume everything to be kind of a @Nonnull by default, so that the TypeScript interfaces are strict, nicely require initialisation of all the fields on creation, and guarantee a value presence when are being read.\nHowever, when it comes to binding a form with a combo-box to the selection field, the following is expected:\n\nThe combo-box is empty by default, unless an initial value is provided or selected by the user. That\u2019s why I\u2019d add @Nullable to make the generated TypeScript type interface for MyForm allow selection to be undefined. We need to explicitly opt-out from the \u201call the data must be defined\u201d\u00a0assumption.\nThe empty combo-box errors when submitted. That\u2019s why I\u2019d add the @NotNull validation constrain.\n\nDo you have any suggestions for how to more reasonably express that kind of a field in Java?", "author": "platosha", "createdAt": "2020-08-11T14:20:49Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2ODA4MTk0Mw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2ODcwOTc1NA==", "url": "https://github.com/vaadin/flow/pull/8835#discussion_r468709754", "bodyText": "From a java point of view combining both annotation doesn't make sense (and probably (not tested; just a guess) some validation frameworks are going to complain about it). My understanding for this kind of TS \"magic\" is that \"java is always first\". Meaning that I create the bean / pojo / dto / object with the annotations or re-use an existing piece of code and just add vaadin as presentation layer.\nExamples:\nclass Person {\n\n  String doctorate;\n\n  @NotNull\n  String name;\n\n  @NotNull\n  Address mainAddress;\n\n  List<Address> secondaryAddresses;\n\n}\n\nclass Address {\n\n  @NotNull\n  String street;\n  // ... and more\n}\nGiven this example; I would expect the following from vaadin to generate:\n\noptional text-input for doctorate\nrequired text-input for name\nrequired layout for mainAddress (in this example a simple text-field)\nbutton \"Add Secondary Address\" which creates a new layout for an address input + a \"Delete this secondary address button\"\n\nor am I mistaken that the Java Bean Validation says that every property is optional until otherwise specified via annotation?\nEdit: Currently with Binder you can specify \"asRequired()\" and the default value passed from server side won't break the UI. Meaning if it is null the combo box is just empty, otherwise it's filled with the current selected item. The TS world should be able to handle such cases as well.
