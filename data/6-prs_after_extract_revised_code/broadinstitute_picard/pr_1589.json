I don't think innie and outie really have meaning for overlapping reads, though I may be confused about this.  There is a test commented as Non overlapping \"outies\" which tests outies.\nPreviously, the \"innie\" requirement was enforced with the logic pos.getAlignmentStart() < neg.getAlignmentEnd(). Combining this with posClipFrom > 0/ negClipFrom > 0 is almost equivalent to the overlapping requirement, except for when the two reads overlap by only a single base.  In this case, the new check of read1.overlaps(read2) will pass, while the old check of pos.getAlignmentStart() < neg.getAlignmentEnd() will not, because instead pos.getAlignmentStart() == neg.getAlignmentEnd().  This is not a behavior change I was intending, as I wasn't aware of this edge case difference until just now.  But I believe the old behavior was actually a bug, since the new behavior is more consistent with my understanding of what is intended.  It doesn't make sense to me that we would clip when two or more bases overlap, but not when only one base overlaps, so I'm guessing that was not intentional.  I have added a test demonstrating this edge case (commented as \"overlap by one base only\"), and have also added the same test on the branch ck_mba_single_overlap_test_example to demonstrate the previous behavior.\nFor your softclipped example, these reads will not go through any additional clipping since they are not overlapping.\nThis is consistent with past behavior, since they would not pass the pos.getAlignmentStart() < neg.getAlignmentEnd() check.", "author": "kachulis", "createdAt": "2020-10-02T13:15:31Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5ODUzMTI3Mw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5OTAzNjk2Nw==", "url": "https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/pull/1589#discussion_r499036967", "bodyText": "\ud83d\udc4d thanks for the explanation", "author": "yfarjoun", "createdAt": "2020-10-02T20:31:58Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ5ODUzMTI3Mw=="}], "type": "inlineReview", "revised_code": {"commit": "f4392e3bdc4b167ab526ac672cf1952088aac07d", "chunk": "diff --git a/src/main/java/picard/sam/AbstractAlignmentMerger.java b/src/main/java/picard/sam/AbstractAlignmentMerger.java\nindex 2211f3ff1..141a11a3a 100644\n--- a/src/main/java/picard/sam/AbstractAlignmentMerger.java\n+++ b/src/main/java/picard/sam/AbstractAlignmentMerger.java\n\n@@ -796,19 +796,22 @@ public abstract class AbstractAlignmentMerger {\n      * starts and ends of each read are the same.\n      */\n     protected static void clipForOverlappingReads(final SAMRecord read1, final SAMRecord read2, final boolean useHardClipping) {\n-        // Only clip if both reads are mapped, on opposite strands, overlapping\n-        if (!read1.getReadUnmappedFlag() && !read2.getReadUnmappedFlag() &&\n-                read1.getReadNegativeStrandFlag() != read2.getReadNegativeStrandFlag() &&\n-                read1.overlaps(read2)) {\n-            final SAMRecord pos = (read1.getReadNegativeStrandFlag()) ?
