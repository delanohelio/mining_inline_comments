The `PendingMutation` now\nhas its own UUID. A mechnism still exists to obtain the ID of the\nassociated model:\n\n    pendingMutation.getMutationId();\n    pendingMutation.getMutatedItem().getId();\n\nThe `PendingMuation.PersistentRecord` now has *two* IDs, a \"mutation\nID\", and a \"decoded model ID\":\n\n    record.getId();\n    record.getDecodedModelId();\n\nPreviously, the getId() on the record would return the same ID as\n`pendingMutation.getMutatedItem().getId()`.\n\nAfter this change, the mutation ID is uniquely for the PendingMutation\nitself. This ID is also of a different type. It is a time-based UUIDv1.\nThis type of UUID was chosen as it may be sorted according to its\ntimestamp. And as a consequence, `PendingMutation`s themselves may now\nbe sorted by their UUIDv1s. `PendingMutation.PersistentRecord`s use this\nas their primary `getId()` value.\n\nThe old ID of `PendingMutation.PersistentRecord` is now available by\n`getDecodedModelIs()`. This is the ID of the _associated model_ -- the\nthing that had undergone some mutation, to begin with. As before, this\nUUID is still a v4 UUID, maintained for its technical superiority over\nthe time-based V1. This value is stored on the record, so that we can\nstill query for records based on _model ID_, which is what is generally\nused aroudn the DataStore system.", "committedDate": "2020-05-07T22:14:22Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "0417ec72949f793ee42f77ac8d1b20052ac839f5", "url": "https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-android/commit/0417ec72949f793ee42f77ac8d1b20052ac839f5", "message": "touchups", "committedDate": "2020-05-08T03:08:56Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQyMjExNTcyNQ==", "url": "https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-android/pull/439#discussion_r422115725", "bodyText": "This was the first method that came to mind when I read the PR intro.
