do is to dis-allow this null QueryPredicate everywhere, entirely. Right now, when we use a null QueryPredicate, it means \"we don't want to do any filtering; allow everything.\" So, we could make that explicit by having a special type of non-null query predicate. Maybe called like AllowAllQueryPredicate or NoOpQueryPredicate. We could make a little utility class, with a factory method: QueryPredicates.matchAll(). The thing that this call returns would be one of these special non-null query predicates, that just matches everything.\n\"Matching everything\" would still need to be coded differently for in-memory, SQL, and GraphQL. Right now we have this code, I think it just checked null == queryPredicate instead of like queryPredicate instanceof AllowAllQueryPreciate, (or, however we might name this new type of predicate.)", "author": "jamesonwilliams", "createdAt": "2020-02-16T21:06:18Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3OTkzMDIwOA=="}], "type": "inlineReview", "revised_code": null}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM3OTkzMDI0Mg==", "url": "https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-android/pull/265#discussion_r379930242", "bodyText": "Let's make predicate @Nullable since the overloaded method calls this with null predicate.", "author": "raphkim", "createdAt": "2020-02-16T20:19:08Z", "path": "aws-datastore/src/androidTest/java/com/amplifyframework/datastore/storage/sqlite/SynchronousStorageAdapter.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,279 @@\n+/*\n+ * Copyright 2020 Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates.
