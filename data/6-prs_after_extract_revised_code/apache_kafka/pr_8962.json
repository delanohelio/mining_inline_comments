Because some other code deep inside another set of nested conditionals thirty lines above looks like it does that right now? Experience says that this situation will not survive refactoring. We cannot test every branch, so we need to make assertions about the state being valid when it's in doubt.\nWe could make an argument that if this assumption becomes incorrect, than we'll throw an exception later on before any state becomes corrupted, which would be good. We could make a stronger argument that the exception we throw later on will be perfectly crystal clear about the cause and therefore we won't spend weeks poking around a flaky test or a user bug report trying to figure out what happened.

Are you saying that it's fine to make this assumption thirty lines up when dealing with tasks that are actually being closed, but it's not ok to make this assumption here specifically when we are recycling tasks? Or are you saying we should add this check in both places where we make this assumption in TM#handleAssignment, and referring to where we do the suspension by \"thirty lines up\" (it's technically down, so maybe I'm being too literal here)\nI guess my point is just that I don't agree with the claim that we're making a \"potentially dangerous assumption\". We do check the assumption very directly when closing the task.", "author": "ableegoldman", "createdAt": "2020-07-06T19:18:01Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0ODU5ODg1NA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ1MDQ3MTcwMQ==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/8962#discussion_r450471701", "bodyText": "Hey folks, taking a step back here regarding this, here are a few different principles we can exercise regarding the class hierarchy:\n\nTM to be totally agnostic to the task's state, and the task's method would transit multiple state if necessary: e.g. if TM calls close on a running task, then task would first transit to suspended, and then to closed; if TM calls suspend on a suspended task, then it would be a no-op. In this case, then here TM could just blindly call close or suspend for closing / recycling tasks, and the Task's methods would handle state transition.\n\nThis would be ideal, but the current issue is that we need to commit post suspending a task today (i.e. handleRevocation would commit those suspended active tasks, while handleAssignment would commit those suspended standby tasks), and hence if we blindly suspend and commit a task, we may unnecessarily double committing a suspended task.\nRight now to work around this issue, we choose to:\n\nLetting TM to be aware of the task's state transition rules and tries to obey it. Similarly, we can also let TM to check the task's state, and then call suspend and commit conditionally -- at the moment, only standby tasks would not be suspended, so we would effectively end up the same logic as to only suspend standby tasks. So either checking task.isActive or task.isSuspended would work the same.\n\nPersonally I think if we want the TM to be purely agnostic to task state transition, an alternative approach could be, that we make preCommit / postCommit to be \"idempotent\" as well, e.g. if the task remembers since last preCommit we do not have processed any records, then a second call to preCommit would be a no-op and returns empty map, and similarly postCommit can also be a no-op if there's no processed records since its last checkpointing. And then in TM, we can blindly call:\ntask.suspend();\naggregatOffsets(task.prepreCommit());\nif (!offsetsMap.isEmpty()) call sendOffsets();\npostOffsets(task.postCommit());\n\nif (isActive()) {\n   recycle as standby;\n} else {\n   recycle as active;\n}\n\nAnd similarly for tasksToClose we can blindly call suspend / preCommit / postCommit first. WDYT?\nAnyways, I think this discussion can continue in a follow-up PR (maybe I can incorporate whatever we've agreed on in the decoupling flushing/committing PR) and we can merge this one as-is.", "author": "guozhangwang", "createdAt": "2020-07-06T20:48:21Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ0ODU5ODg1NA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ1MDUxMzI4OA==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/8962#discussion_r450513288", "bodyText": "Thanks, all!\nThanks for adding the check, @ableegoldman . To answer your question, I do think there may be some kind of misunderstanding. Almost certainly, I failed to make myself clear.\nI agree that the reason we enforce the valid transitions inside the task is so that the TM doesn't have to check every little thing. For example, that we call suspend in one place and close in another is not a big deal. As you pointed out, if we failed to call suspend, then the close call would let us know.\nHowever, in this case, we are checking something. But what we're checking is only vaguely related to what we do next. In other words, if (! isSuspended() ) suspend() makes way more sense than if ( isStandby() ) suspend(). How are we supposed to know that standby == not suspended at line 275 of a 700-line class? At least, with the log you added, if any quadrant of the implication is false, we'll have an error log telling us where it went wrong.\nNote, I think I was especially uneasy because we're now also committing the task in this block, and \"committed\" or \"not committed\" isn't a checked state, which is how we wound up with the subtle bug that you're fixing here. I think your fix is fine; I just felt the pre-existing structure of the code needed improvement.\nAnd thanks for the alternative proposals, @guozhangwang .
