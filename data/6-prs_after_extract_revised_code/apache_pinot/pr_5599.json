It looks like, this does both 1 (outbound) submission of request to server and 2. (inbound) receiving the response which is DataTable. Is that correct?\nIt would be nice to add detailed Javadoc highlighting the semantics of this handler", "author": "siddharthteotia", "createdAt": "2020-06-29T17:08:35Z", "path": "pinot-server/src/main/java/org/apache/pinot/server/starter/grpc/DataTableHandler.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,30 @@\n+/**\n+ * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\n+ * or more contributor license agreements.
