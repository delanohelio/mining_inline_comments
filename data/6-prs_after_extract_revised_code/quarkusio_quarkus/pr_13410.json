There is no mechanism for the callback to be aware of the situation for how a removal occurred and to no-op. At best it can safeguard against multiple invocations. The code in question.\nThe logic in this callback is to try to update the entry's metadata (weight, expiration) on success, try to remove it on failure, and record the statistics. If the entry was replaced or removed prior to completion then the conditional writes fail, but the statistics are still valid so they are recorded. For example an in-progress load that is removed still counts towards the load time and having started due to a cache miss. Similarly, LoadingCache.refresh(key) might load but fail to replace the entry if it was explicit removed, such as after when the system of record was updated and the cache invalidated.\nTrying to special case the logger to sometimes log and other times not based on guessing the likely user interaction is error prone. If the use-case is to warn because users forget to handle errors, an ignoring to log when an in-flight future was explicitly inserted doesn't somehow negate error handling. I would agree the cache isn't responsible for a user's error handling, but unfortunately real world code means we have to be mindful that most will forget and silently ignore production errors.\nI suspect the cleanest solution is simply to disable the logger. That is a simple configuration or api call and matches how loggers are intended to be used. Otherwise, you will have to restore the workaround to suppress the error from the cache's perspective in order to silence this message.", "author": "ben-manes", "createdAt": "2020-11-21T05:52:18Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyODA1MDI1MA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyODIzMDI5Nw==", "url": "https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/13410#discussion_r528230297", "bodyText": "Thanks for your very detailed answer @ben-manes!\nI don't really like the idea of this extension changing the behavior of Caffeine application-wide, so I restored the workaround to suppress the warning.", "author": "gwenneg", "createdAt": "2020-11-21T18:56:45Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyODA1MDI1MA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUyODIzMDQyNw==", "url": "https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/13410#discussion_r528230427", "bodyText": "That is true, except I thought (maybe incorrectly) that Quarkus shades Caffeine so it would only apply to your extension if you disable the logger at the shaded path?
