The String value of the property name ...PROJECT_PARENT_FOLDER is \"projdir\"; and in older areas of code is a literal string rather than a define. Your suggestion, save folder.getParentFile() as property value was actually my first attempt to fix this. Things got weird and changes started radiating; reverted that attempt. The property \"projdir\" is globally used by the wizard infrastructure and it means the base directory of the new project and not the parent directory of the newly created project directory.\nAfter a circuitous route, I decided to find the the screen for a plain old java project. It is\njava/java.j2seproject/src/org/netbeans/modules/java/j2seproject/ui/wizards/PanelProjectLocationVisual.java\nand it uses the same names and has similar code to its maven counterpart. (Undoubtedly the prototype for this screen)\nSo, while it's tempting to rename things so they make sense. I am hesitant to diverge from the original code. BTW, in the code you quote from the store() method, renaming the variable parentFolder to projectDirectory would be accurate. Then when the two lines are restored it would be like saying projectLocation = projectDirectory.getParentFile(). It could have read like that, but the original code was probably avoiding declaring new variables. Note that in the code in read() projectLocation = ProjectChooser.getProjectsFolder() retrieves the default value for where to put new projects the other branch of the \"if\" statement is working with the value of \"projdir\" and does [\"projdir\"].getParentFile().", "author": "errael", "createdAt": "2020-03-02T21:10:28Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4NjYwODc0NQ=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM4NzIxMDgzOQ==", "url": "https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1980#discussion_r387210839", "bodyText": "Ok - I might be wrong, but this is awfully lot text to say, that the project parent folder is not the project parent folder.
