Is there any chance you could find out? My feeling is that the ZK writes which TO does will slow it down, but IDK the difference as a factor. If it was 2\u00d7 slower that might be OK. If it was 10\u00d7 slower I think we'd definitely need to look into it more.\nAnother thing is how long is takes to do periodic reconciliation when there are 1000 topics. It shouldn't really affect the (eventual) correctness, but again it would be good to get a feel for these numbers.", "author": "tombentley", "createdAt": "2020-04-29T12:54:42Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQxNzEzODY0NA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQxNzk2MzkxNA==", "url": "https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/pull/2899#discussion_r417963914", "bodyText": "I have tried to create 1000 topics via AdminClient and it was in approximately ~9 mins.", "author": "see-quick", "createdAt": "2020-04-30T12:13:10Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQxNzEzODY0NA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQxNzk2NDkwNg==", "url": "https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/pull/2899#discussion_r417964906", "bodyText": "@see-quick thanks for that, it's a useful datapoint.", "author": "tombentley", "createdAt": "2020-04-30T12:14:58Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQxNzEzODY0NA=="}], "type": "inlineReview", "revised_code": null}]}
