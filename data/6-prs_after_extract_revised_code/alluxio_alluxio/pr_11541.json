This\nhasn't burned us until now because the new syncing changes\nassumed all inodes in the locklist would be downgraded when\ncalling LockedInodePath#downgradeToPattern(LockPattern).\nThis was not the case, which ended up causing a deadlock\nwhen the lock list contained many inodes.\n\nOne common case where this can occur is when a user is\nloading a deeply nested file or directory via some getStatus or\nlistStatus call which syncs metadata and in-turn, will create\nthe paths as it discovers them. In doing so, the lock list is\ninitially populated with write locks. We require them to all\nbe downgraded to read locks for the metadata sync to be\nperformed properly.\n\nThe new syncing design also now only requires downgrades\nto read locks which simplifies a lot of logic which existed\nto support downgrades from WRITE_EDGE to\nWRITE_INODE. These changes removes a good chunk of\nthat complicated code in favor of a simpler approach\nwhich simply performs the lock downgrade for all inodes\nin the list.\n\nA new integration test case was added for this regression.", "committedDate": "2020-06-12T00:03:38Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "96b7a76f8d28cc30e72cc8b1c3de7e7b4a7115b6", "url": "https://github.com/Alluxio/alluxio/commit/96b7a76f8d28cc30e72cc8b1c3de7e7b4a7115b6", "message": "Only downgrade sub-list for composite\n\nThis follows the pattern outlined in the javadoc to never modify the\noriginal list.", "committedDate": "2020-06-12T00:03:43Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "2c2d8a01dde18ddbe6d3606fbbf8fd1cf8dd16a4", "url": "https://github.com/Alluxio/alluxio/commit/2c2d8a01dde18ddbe6d3606fbbf8fd1cf8dd16a4", "message": "Address comments", "committedDate": "2020-06-12T00:03:43Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "2c2d8a01dde18ddbe6d3606fbbf8fd1cf8dd16a4", "url": "https://github.com/Alluxio/alluxio/commit/2c2d8a01dde18ddbe6d3606fbbf8fd1cf8dd16a4", "message": "Address comments", "committedDate": "2020-06-12T00:03:43Z", "type": "forcePushed"}]}
