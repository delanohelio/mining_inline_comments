Of course the intention it will always be invoked via platinum,\nbut maybe that won't always be the case.\n\nFirst clean up all unused arguments and classes which still reference them. Also rename\nprivate network to just network (private network isn't really a thing) and patient\nreport bucket to output bucket (no reports are in that bucket).\n\nCMEK becomes an optional again, and the strict checking is disabled.\n\nThe public image is just enabled by a flag, which is actually not exposed to the CLI\nand can only be enabled with the PUBLIC profile. This way we can never have public\nmode running with a private image", "committedDate": "2020-08-06T16:59:23Z", "type": "commit"}, {"oid": "c9b361531cafbb940c3ca83927f2cbba83518ccd", "url": "https://github.com/hartwigmedical/pipeline5/commit/c9b361531cafbb940c3ca83927f2cbba83518ccd", "message": "DEV-1443 Remove pico from pom\n\nDidn't use it.", "committedDate": "2020-08-06T17:05:55Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2NjU3NTE4MQ==", "url": "https://github.com/hartwigmedical/pipeline5/pull/181#discussion_r466575181", "bodyText": "I'm wrestling with whether it would be more obvious if this were called PLATINUM.", "author": "nedleitch", "createdAt": "2020-08-06T17:33:10Z", "path": "cluster/src/main/java/com/hartwig/pipeline/Arguments.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -12,6 +12,7 @@\n     String EMPTY = \"\";\n \n     enum DefaultsProfile {\n+        PUBLIC,", "originalCommit": "c9b361531cafbb940c3ca83927f2cbba83518ccd", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2NjU4NzU1OQ==", "url": "https://github.com/hartwigmedical/pipeline5/pull/181#discussion_r466587559", "bodyText": "the public profile can be used outside platinum.", "author": "pauldwolfe", "createdAt": "2020-08-06T17:55:06Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2NjU3NTE4MQ=="}], "type": "inlineReview", "revised_code": null}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2NjU3NzQ0MQ==", "url": "https://github.com/hartwigmedical/pipeline5/pull/181#discussion_r466577441", "bodyText": "In the spirit of cleanup herein, would now be a good time to rename VmAligner to Aligner?", "author": "nedleitch", "createdAt": "2020-08-06T17:37:04Z", "path": "cluster/src/main/java/com/hartwig/pipeline/alignment/AlignerProvider.java", "diffHunk": "@@ -77,9 +76,9 @@ private LocalAlignerProvider(final GoogleCredentials credentials, final Storage\n         @Override\n         VmAligner wireUp(GoogleCredentials credentials, Storage storage, AlignmentOutputStorage alignmentOutputStorage,", "originalCommit": "c9b361531cafbb940c3ca83927f2cbba83518ccd", "replyToReviewId": null, "replies": [{"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDQ2NjU4ODIzMA==", "url": "https://github.com/hartwigmedical/pipeline5/pull/181#discussion_r466588230", "bodyText": "should be a separate commit.
