This can be figured out by looking at ViewFsBaseTest.java#testListOnInternalDirsOfMountTable (which was way old test) and also I had discussion with Sanjay on that.\nSo, I don't think it's reasonable to change that assumption/behavior now.\n\nAny idea where the link.getTargetLink() in the FileStatus can be or is used?\nFileStatus has getSymlink API. Also Filestatus path represents link path. and symlink path represents target path. This seems to be correct.\n\nComing to permissions bit I just realized symlink showing its own permissions instead of target in macos also. ( but we just changed the behavior in HADOOP-17029 where we display target dir's permissions and group. cc: @abhishekdas99, as per linux/macos the older behavior seems to be ok, but ViewFS perspective it seems to be good to show target permissions instead of showing some bogus permissions. I think in ViewFS case the in-memory InternalViewFSDirFS was created by fs but we can not really cary who created what mount, we will just configure in xml that link and would not have any info who added that, all should be at admins permission control only ). I assume in linux mount link dir will be created with the permission to the current user who created right? Since we don't have that link creation logic dynamically at ViewFS, I don't think we can behave exactly same as Linux here?\nMy another original question was why we should not have symlink on dir?\nis it because HDFS does not support that? If that because of hdfs, should we move that assert under HdfsNamedFileStatus?

If you look at our FSPermission class we have a stickybit to denote its a file or not. Unfortunately it's just a boolean, it does not have 3rd option to represent link.\npublic FsPermission(FsAction u, FsAction g, FsAction o, boolean sb) {\n    set(u, g, o, sb);\n  }\n\n(nio) Files.isDirectory returns true for a symlink if target is dir. Where as Hadoop FileStatus class does not allow if symlink represent as dir. Behaviors are confusing :-(\nThat means we don't have enough info captured in Permissions or FileStatus classes to represent symlink properly.\nComing to getFileStatus question:\nIn your above quoted code runs on internal directory, thats not a link. Here internal directory means, if you have link src as /a/b/c, here a, b are internal dirs (here it's always a dir, so we can safely hardcode to true)  and c is a link dir.\nGetFileStatus run in input path, so, when input path is link, it would have resolved and run getFileStatus on targetFileSystem#getFileStatus. Where listStatus gets the FileStatus of immediate childrens. So, listStatus of /a/b , since be is an internal dir, it will go to InetrnalViewFsDir and run listStatus. and one of its child c is a link. so previously treating that children FileStatus object as symlink with isDir is false, irrespective whether target is file/dir. One safe assumption we can keep is, in ViewFS target would always be a directory only. I don't think anyone would configure a file as target link. But we can not leave that case anyway for consistency. Hope this helps. I also don't have very clear opinions here. Symlinks seems to mess around here. :-( .\nBut I like the idea of representing as symlink as that one of fs features. but consistent behavior is what we need to find here. If we wanted to fix getFileStatus(\"/a/b/c\"), we need to make isDir as false, but current it will return true as it runs on targetFileSystem and also give symlink with tagetFs path. Here no way user  know whether the target is file or dir, unless he directly access symlinked path and see.\nLet me catchup Sanjay, if he has some thoughts around.\nBut in any case, I don't have oppositions to any of the approach, all up to you whichever way you want to go ahead. :-)\nThank you.
