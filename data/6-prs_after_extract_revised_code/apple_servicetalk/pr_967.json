It also terminates the `Single` with failure if connect fails.\nThis violates the contract of the `Subscriber` that there should only be a single termination signal.\n\n__Modification__\n\nAs we have to complete the returned `Single` with the channel as soon as the channel is registered to ensure we do not miss channel events and we also have to propagate connect failures, we can not abide by the `Single<Channel>` contract. Instead of returning `Single<Channel>` now returning `Single<Connection>` and do the translation of `Channel` -> `Connection` using a supplied `Function`.\n\n__Result__\n\n`TcpConnector#connect` abides by the `Subscriber` contract.", "committedDate": "2020-03-13T21:44:59Z", "type": "commit"}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5Mjg5ODU5Ng==", "url": "https://github.com/apple/servicetalk/pull/967#discussion_r392898596", "bodyText": "nit: is this really what happens ?
