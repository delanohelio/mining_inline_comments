The way I see it right now, the entry point (set) happens in the createCustomTabResponseIntent whereas the exit / reset will be the onResume method. I can move it to sendResult but that means exposing the field to the parent. It is already a static, I don't want to make it public as that would just cause more problems. Can't put the field on the parent class either as should not belong there as it is specific to the Browser case.", "author": "shahzaibj", "createdAt": "2020-03-20T20:58:44Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5NTgzMjY2MA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5NTg4Nzk2OQ==", "url": "https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-common-for-android/pull/867#discussion_r395887969", "bodyText": "Okay, lets take the fix in then", "author": "kreedula", "createdAt": "2020-03-20T21:01:27Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5NTgzMjY2MA=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5NTg5MDc1Ng==", "url": "https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-common-for-android/pull/867#discussion_r395890756", "bodyText": "k sounds like this is as good as we're gonna do in the near term", "author": "iambmelt", "createdAt": "2020-03-20T21:09:08Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDM5NTgzMjY2MA=="}], "type": "inlineReview", "revised_code": null}]}
