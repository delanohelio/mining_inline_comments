I was thinking of doing endsWith() on the last item here, with slicing and appending the new suffix, but it's a bit messier.\nThe current approach also handles the first nested map a bit nicer, since we don't need to setup the correct suffix when pushing to the stack (only handled by this method). This way, we only need to push the same field name again, the rest is handled in this method.\nExample:\n1. A\n2. A-> A   # readMapBegin() on L551\n3. A-> A$k # readCurrentContext() in readXXX()\n4. A-> A$v # readCurrentContext() in readXXX()\n...\n\nBut if you think using an ArrayList is better, I can change it! I can also only add the $k prefix in readMapBegin() and writeMapBegin(), since it might make debugging easier and there's one \"edge case\" less.\nEDIT: Thinking about it, keeping the A -> A case in readMapBegin() might be useful, if someone decides to add some additional logic that depends on the current actual field name being on the stack, before starting to handle the key.", "author": "KarboniteKream", "createdAt": "2020-10-08T11:08:27Z", "replyToReviewId": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwMTYxMDI1Mw=="}, {"id": "MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDUwMTY0NjMyOA==", "url": "https://github.com/line/armeria/pull/3091#discussion_r501646328", "bodyText": "I think it's OK as it is.
