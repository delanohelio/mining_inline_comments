At the moment, it checks the limit at both places, which seems like a reasonable method generally since both have to take part in responding.\nIt doesn't handle this failure in a special manner at the forwarder and it would just try the standby, as you're hinting at.  This could be a way to quickly shift load from one overwhelmed host to another, though in the current scheme, next time, we'll just try the overwhelmed host again, so it's not perfect at the moment.\nTo me, being overwhelmed with queries is not unlike the host being down temporarily, and the solution we have is to fail over to a standby.
